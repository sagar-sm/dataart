###Gowanus Flora Reporter V1###

*Built with Python, MongoDB, Google Maps API, Mapbox.js and Flask*

On April 6 2014, I took my first canoe trip down the Gowanus Canal. This is the version of the web app I used to identify and geotag tree species along the waters edge. Due to the late spring, there were no leaves on the trees yet, making them much harder to identify. The Paulownia tree however, has large clusters of egg shaped seed pods that remained on many of the trees throughout the winter. This tree is incredibly resiliant, invasive, and of course, we introduced it to the Gowanus area.

*Why canoe down a superfund site?*

Canoeing allowed me to get close to the trees along the waters edge and avoid trespassing. 

*Accuracy*

Because I was using a phone and web technology, the data points were most accurate when approached a wifi source, and accuracy decreased as I went into more remote areas.

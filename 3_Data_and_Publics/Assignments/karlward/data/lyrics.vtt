00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.920
This land is your land

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:19.400
This land is my land

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:21.690
From California

00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:24.340
To the New York island

00:00:24.341 --> 00:00:26.750
From the redwood forest

00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:29.640
To the Gulf Stream waters

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:35.680
This land was made for you and me

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.170
As I went walking

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:40.620
That ribbon of highway

00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:42.950
I saw above me

00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:46.340
That endless skyway

00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:48.730
I saw below me

00:00:48.731 --> 00:00:52.060
That golden valley

00:00:52.061 --> 00:01:14.420
This land was made for you and me

00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:16.620
I've roamed and rambled

00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:19.090
And I followed my footsteps

00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:21.270
To the sparkling sands of

00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:23.850
Her diamond deserts

00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:25.900
And all around me

00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:28.970
A voice was sounding

00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:34.730
This land was made for you and me

00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:37.140
There was a big high wall there

00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:39.310
That tried to stop me

00:01:39.311 --> 00:01:41.300
The sign was painted

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.880
It said "Private Property"

00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:46.180
But on the back side

00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:49.100
It didn't say nothing

00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:54.820
This land was made for you and me

00:01:54.821 --> 00:01:57.250
When the sun comes shining

00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:59.570
Then I was strolling

00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:01.820
And the wheat fields waving

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.650
And the dust clouds rolling

00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:06.930
A voice was chanting

00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:10.050
As the fog was lifting

00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:14.670
This land was made for you and me

00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:16.730
This land is your land

00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:19.230
This land is my land

00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:21.480
From California

00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:23.680
To the New York island

00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:25.660
From the redwood forest

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.800
To the Gulf Stream waters

00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:45.590
This land was made for you and me

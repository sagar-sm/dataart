It fell to $437 in later New York trading. Still, the recent increases are a far cry from the mania that surrounded the metal in 1980, when its price was as high as $850 an ounce on Jan. 20 and $700 in early October. Since then, disinflation - a slowdown in the rate of price increases - has become the buzzword in the financial markets, and prices have tumbled for a variety of commodities, such as oil, that were once avidly sought by investors as protection against inflation."

Currency traders said the dollar fell in United States trading because of a slight drop in the key Federal funds rate, the interest charged on overnight loans among banks. Lower interest rates often weaken the dollar by making dollar-denominated investments less attractive."

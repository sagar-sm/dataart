Something like that was presumably what James A. Baker 3d, incoming White House chief of staff, had in mind when he said last week that Mr. Reagan was considering declaring an ''economic emergency'' on Inauguration Day to dramatize the situation's seriousness and the administration's determination to act."

The resolution of this dilemna will occur when rural people have a stronger voice in Government and Party decision making.

Then they attempted to collectivize, sending in urban people unfamiliar with rural conditions."

Living costs have become unbearable for many average Turks like Ayse's father, a retired air force noncommissioned officer. He says he cannot find other employment and his pension of $100 a month is simply not enough for him, his wife and three school-age children to live on."

But ask Lebanese businessmen when their economy started heading into a tailspin and many will respond with little hesitation: 1:03 p.m., April 18 - the moment the United States Embassy in Beirut was destroyed. ''In the opinion of both businessmen and the average citizen, the Lebanese economy is now in its deepest crisis since the civil war started in 1975,'' said Elias S. Saba, a former finance minister and now chairman of Allied Business Bank. ''The turning point was the explosion of the American Embassy. It wasn't the cause of the downturn. It simply tore away the curtain before everyone's eyes and made them realize that things in Lebanon were not as rosy as we wanted to think.'' The day after the embassy was blown up, recalls Johann Naschek, owner of the busy Myrtom House restaurant, ''Our business dropped by 20 percent. It hasn't recovered; it was just a real shock.''"

''Before, they used to say that every Israeli had to be a general,'' said Yaacov Fisher, senior economist at the Bank of Israel. ''Now they say that every Israeli has to be an economist.'' The crisis, economists say, has been produced partly by excessive military burdens but also by the peculiar structure of Israel's political system, the economic restraints of Zionism, years of living beyond the nation's means and sheer mismanagement by some of its governments. A Different Israel to Emerge The Israel that emerges from the crisis, the analysts here contend, will be a different place, with a lower standard of living for its citizens, a lower military budget, some very high unemployment or a combination of the three. It will also be an Israel that is much more dependent on foreign creditors, in particular the United States."

''We have an economic situation of such extreme gravity that it has no precedent in Argentine history,'' said Horatio Jaunarena, Under Secretary of Defense and a member of the Alfonsin team trying to reform the structure of Argentine society. Amid this economic crisis, the new Government faces opposition from Peronist labor unions that have been allied to the military. The Government's agonizing problem is whether it can stick to democratic means, provide the better living standards it has promised to working people and still bring inflation under control. Backed by Business Leaders So far, the Alfonsin administration is getting a remarkable degree of support from many business leaders, who view it as trying to lay the foundation for a more stable democratic society."

When the company's stock was first sold to the public in 1994, about a dozen executives became millionaires. One year the company took all employees and their families to Lake Tahoe for a Christmas vacation. But this year, the Christmas party will probably be pot luck. Mattson's sales have dropped in half from their peak last year. One round of layoffs at the 400-employee company has occurred and another is in the works. And the company's stock, which traded above $16 in July 1997, has fallen to $5.375, making employee stock options worthless."

But the problems need not lead to world recession, let alone depression. With time and wisdom, the problems can be overcome. The gathering in Washington of the world's financial leaders last week proved to be long on alarming rhetoric and short on action. The dismal forecasts contrasted sharply with what the visiting central bankers and finance ministers could see around them in a prosperous country where it is lies, not layoffs, that dominate the news. But the United States is beginning to feel effects of the Asian collapse, particularly in manufacturing, and has reason to worry as Latin American economies are damaged by high interest rates imposed to slow the exodus of foreign investors. Similarly, Western Europe's export-led growth is threatened."

This means passengers who until now have flown the airline's daily nonstop flight between Los Angeles and Manila, or the thrice-weekly nonstop flights between San Francisco and Manila, will have to make other arrangements. But no other arrangements from the United States will include nonstops. Northwest Airlines, for example, has daily flights to Manila from nine United States cities, including New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. But all of them connect through Tokyo, which after a layover of about two hours requires a change of plane and an additional four and a half hours of flying. Northwest's daily flight from Memphis to Manila via Tokyo also requires a stop and a change of plane in Seattle."

Employees took over the plant on Jan. 5 to protest that move, so Mr. Diniz still spends his day on the plant floor, playing dominos with his fellow workers. The stoppage means that Ford is no longer producing its daily quota of 1,000 cars, but the company has not moved against the workers -- perhaps because car sales are declining so dramatically in Brazil that Ford has the equivalent of nearly two months of production stockpiled in storage areas here."

But this fall, with the financial crisis providing an irresistible new coda to the course, he extended the timeline to include the drama, intrigue and pain of the past two years.

''We compare the confidence man of 1840 to the confidence man of today.''"

In cooler climates he prefers roll-neck pullovers or a trench. In Santiago (to discuss Chilean reform) or New Orleans (to cover the economic repercussions of Hurricane Katrina), he wears cotton shirts of such a low thread count that they are vaguely see-through, and he leaves them unbuttoned enough to suggest that if he hadn't become the Laurence A. Tisch professor of history at Harvard, he might have turned into Rick Springfield. In promotional material for this PBS series (which begins on Wednesday and continues over the next three weeks), Mr. Ferguson adorns himself with a single gold-hoop earring that he forgoes for the documentary itself. I was disappointed not to see it, imagining that perhaps he had dressed himself according to Coco Chanel's maxim that when accessorizing, you should always take off the last thing you put on."

For more than a century, Colton's kilns and crushing machines have been churning out cement for the streets and buildings of Los Angeles. But the company says the plant's future is now uncertain. The recession has sent cement prices plunging, lowered profits and forced CalPortland's drivers to cut back on hours. And the company says it faces new expenses: the cost of meeting California's new requirements that manufacturers take steps to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas linked to global warming."

A year and a half later, barely $1 billion has come in, mostly from the United States. Canada, Spain, South Korea and the Gates Foundation recently promised around $400 million, but many donors have been shifting old aid pledges into the new fund, and counting them twice."

With the markets taking fright at budget deficits in Greece, Portugal and Spain, and sapping confidence in Europe's single currency, the need for strong leadership within the 27-member European Union has rarely been greater. But the crisis has raised questions about the European Union's ability to deal with the structural problems that have led to a rift between richer and poor nations within the eurozone."

How do you create excitement when most of the action consists of middle-aged white men in conservative suits talking on the phone, and the closest thing to a car chase is a stately procession of big black Town Cars? How often can you show people peering at spreadsheets and recoiling in alarm? What do you do when the scandal itself might as well be labeled ''Too Complicated to Understand''? The HBO film ''Too Big to Fail,'' based on the book of the same name by the reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times, about the financial crisis of 2008, uses every cinematic trick in the book, but ultimately succeeds because we know that the danger was real. One way to create an atmosphere of crisis is simply to have your characters assert that it's a crisis. In ''Too Big to Fail,'' directed by Curtis Hanson (''L.A. Confidential''), people are always saying things like, ''If we don't do this now, we won't have an economy on Monday.'' There's also a lot of staring soulfully through windows or into mirrors. The hero of Mr. Sorkin's version of events, Treasury secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., played by William Hurt, indicates the terrible stress he's under by talking ever-more softly. The Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke, played by Paul Giamatti, does the same. As things get worse, the conversation at their weekly breakfast meetings degenerates into a low rumble."

As he faced the bleak prospect of ordering Christmas layoffs at his family firm of two generations, he wrote a last message: ''Sorry, I cannot take it anymore.''"

Now worsening economic conditions are further sabotaging hopes for a democratic future. The country's foreign currency reserves have fallen from a peak of $36 billion to about $10 billion and could run out entirely by March. The currency is under severe pressure, and a steep drop in the exchange rate could bring painful inflation and more social unrest. Youth unemployment is about 25 percent, a dangerous situation where 60 percent of the citizens are 30 and under."

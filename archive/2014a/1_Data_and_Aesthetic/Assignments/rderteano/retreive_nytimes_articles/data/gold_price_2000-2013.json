The chief executive, Randall Oliphant, above, said higher costs at the El Indio mine in Chile and Goldstrike in Nevada, coupled with lower interest income, would probably result in earnings for the year ''at the lower end'' of earlier estimates of 70 to 75 cents a share. Cash costs for the second quarter rose to $162 an ounce from $144. The average realized price dropped to $340 an ounce from $360, still well above prevailing market prices, thanks to an active hedging policy. Second-quarter output rose to 958,400 ounces from 899,000 ounces. Bernard Simon (NYT)"

The chief executive, Randall Oliphant, above, said higher costs at the El Indio mine in Chile and Goldstrike in Nevada, coupled with lower interest income, would probably result in earnings for the year ''at the lower end'' of earlier estimates of 70 to 75 cents a share. Cash costs for the second quarter rose to $162 an ounce from $144. The average realized price dropped to $340 an ounce from $360, still well above prevailing market prices, thanks to an active hedging policy. Second-quarter output rose to 958,400 ounces from 899,000 ounces. Bernard Simon (NYT)"

Mr. Oppenheimer built a world-class racecar track, gardens, parks, Olympic-length pools and broad avenues for white miners, while black miners languished in single-sex hostels."

Built by the mining magnate Ernest Oppenheimer above the vast, and seemingly limitless, riches underground, Welkom was a homestead for South Africa's cash-flush white miners. In its heyday in the 1970's, when Welkom produced 35 percent of South Africa's gold, the city bustled with new-money flash, and represented, perhaps more than any city in South Africa, apartheid's divisions. Mr. Oppenheimer built a world-class racecar track, gardens, parks, Olympic-length pools and broad avenues for white miners, while black miners languished in single-sex hostels."

And with the price of bullion rising -- in December, it topped $500 an ounce for the first time in nearly 25 years -- mutual fund investors have been bitten by the gold bug, too. In the first 10 months of 2005, a net $2.3 billion flowed into precious-metals funds, which tend to be dominated by gold miners' stocks. That inflow was up 50 percent over the full-year figure for 2004. Just a few years ago, some investors were fleeing these funds; they had net outflows in 2000 and 2001."

John Maynard Keynes, the economist, railed against it. Neil Young wrote songs about it. Nobody, besides butchers, rhapsodizes about pork bellies. And with the price of bullion rising -- in December, it topped $500 an ounce for the first time in nearly 25 years -- mutual fund investors have been bitten by the gold bug, too. In the first 10 months of 2005, a net $2.3 billion flowed into precious-metals funds, which tend to be dominated by gold miners' stocks. That inflow was up 50 percent over the full-year figure for 2004. Just a few years ago, some investors were fleeing these funds; they had net outflows in 2000 and 2001."

But, now that the price of gold is near record highs, they are leaving their companies, raising capital to start their own prospecting start-ups and heading for Mexico. On Tuesday, an ounce of gold hit $929.30, up from $665 a year ago. Back in 1980, oil shock and economic gloom drove the price to $875 an ounce; that would be more than $2,000 today."

But it would be naïve to ignore the influence that Fed policy has on markets around the globe. And at present the Fed risks blowing global bubbles, with potentially damaging effects. The bubble blowing begins with beliefs about the Fed's thinking. In the last few weeks the understanding has become that the Fed favors a second round of quantitative easing. The impacts have been many: a sharp fall in the dollar against the euro, yen and many emerging market currencies; appreciating bonds and equities in both the developed world and emerging markets; a record nominal gold price; and a jump in commodity prices."

But looking back to the last inflation-adjusted peak price in 1980, it's far from impossible that the gold price could soon go above $5,000 an ounce. The potential level of a new high can be estimated in several ways. Based on consumer price inflation, the peak of $875 an ounce in 1980 is equivalent to about $2,300 today, almost twice the current gold price. But there's a case for taking account of economic expansion as well as price inflation. The world's economic output has increased about sixfold since 1980. Scale up the peak 30 years ago by that multiple, and the gold price could top out at around $5,300."

Those were the glory days, we've been taught, repeatedly and indelibly. Still, the momentum is especially -- and poignantly -- palpable in ''Robert & Ethel Scull: Portrait of a Collection,'' at Acquavella Galleries in Manhattan. The show, which was proposed to Acquavella by the writer Judith Goldman, contains 37 paintings, sculptures and drawings, along with some photo documentation. It rushes from Abstract Expressionist paintings like Willem de Kooning's whiplash ''Police Gazette'' of 1955 to the Earthworks that Michael Heizer began cutting in the floor of the Nevada desert in 1968. In between are efforts by a string of impressive names: paintings by Jasper Johns, James Rosenquist, Myron Stout, Larry Poons, Andy Warhol and Frank Stella; sculptures by Mark di Suvero, John Chamberlain and Claes Oldenburg, Walter De Maria and Robert Morris."

But looking back to the last inflation-adjusted peak price in 1980, it's far from impossible that the gold price could soon go above $5,000 an ounce. The potential level of a new high can be estimated in several ways. Based on consumer price inflation, the peak of $875 an ounce in 1980 is equivalent to about $2,300 today, almost twice the current gold price. But there's a case for taking account of economic expansion as well as price inflation. The world's economic output has increased about sixfold since 1980. Scale up the peak 30 years ago by that multiple, and the gold price could top out at around $5,300."

Those were the glory days, we've been taught, repeatedly and indelibly. Still, the momentum is especially -- and poignantly -- palpable in ''Robert & Ethel Scull: Portrait of a Collection,'' at Acquavella Galleries in Manhattan. The show, which was proposed to Acquavella by the writer Judith Goldman, contains 37 paintings, sculptures and drawings, along with some photo documentation. It rushes from Abstract Expressionist paintings like Willem de Kooning's whiplash ''Police Gazette'' of 1955 to the Earthworks that Michael Heizer began cutting in the floor of the Nevada desert in 1968. In between are efforts by a string of impressive names: paintings by Jasper Johns, James Rosenquist, Myron Stout, Larry Poons, Andy Warhol and Frank Stella; sculptures by Mark di Suvero, John Chamberlain and Claes Oldenburg, Walter De Maria and Robert Morris."

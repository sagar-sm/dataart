A laboratory analysis conducted yesterday in Rome confirmed the results of a previous test in which traces of the drug were found in his urine sample, taken after a game on March 17 in Bari, Italy. Maradona, a 30-year-old professional from Argentina, has played for the Naples team in the Italian league since 1984. The announcement of the test results was made by the Italian Soccer Federation, which will set the length of suspension next week. According to the rules of the international federation for soccer, which are far more strict than those governing drug offenses in American professional sports leagues, a first offense for cocaine use would mean an automatic two-year suspension. For Maradona, the maximum penalty would mean he would be 32 years old, and beyond his prime, before he returned to soccer. Any penalty would apply in all 154 countries affiliated with the international body, the Federation Internationale de Football Association, commonly known by the acronym FIFA. By comparison, a player in the National Football League would have to fail tests for cocaine three times before being suspended indefinitely, with the right of review after one year. Others Tarnished by Drug While Maradona is hardly the first professional athlete to have been linked to cocaine use, he is easily the most famous. Other athletes whose careers have been tarnished include such notable American stars as Dwight Gooden of the Mets and Dexter Manley of the Washington Redskins. In addition, the 1986 death of Len Bias, a basketball star from the University of Maryland, was ruled to be related to cocaine use. A product of the Buenos Aires slums who made as much as $3 million in annual salary and three times that in commercial endorsements, Maradona nurtured his legend with his stunning control of the ball, crackling maneuverability and a powerful left foot as dangerous scoring goals as setting them up with impossible passes. In 1986, as national team captain, he led Argentina to the World Cup championship in Mexico. In the same role last summer in Italy, he wept openly when Germany defeated Argentina in the final. He also led Naples to its first two championships in the Italian club league, in 1987 and 1990, the equivalent of Super Bowl victories, and in 1989 to victory in the even more prestigious European club championship. But Maradona's flamboyance extended beyond the soccer fields and made him one of the world's most prominent sports celebrities. His wedding reception two years ago cost millions of dollars and fed gossip columns for months. For more than a decade, words hardly did him justice. Franz Beckenbauer, once West Germany's greatest player and coach of the 1990 world championship team: \"Maradona is the great player every team wants to have.\" Guy Thys, the Belgium team coach after the 1986 World Cup: \"If Maradona was in my team, Belgium would have been in the final.\" Arrigo Sacchi, the coach of A.C. Milan of the Italian league: \"Maradona was even greater than Pele.\" But in more recent years, the accolades became mixed with criticism, as Maradona, never a stranger to controversy, found himself its constant companion. Eccentricities and More At first, they were merely impish episodes of a rich eccentric: missed practices here and there, unauthorized extensions of a summer or winter vacation, or arguments with coaches. But more recently, his off-the-field involvements took on more somber and serious tones. Four months ago, he shocked both his Naples teammates and his adoring fans when he inexplicably refused to travel to Moscow for Naples's match against Spartak Moscow in the European Champion's Cup tournament, the continent's most prestigious club competition. Maradona eventually changed his mind and arrived in time for the match, but Naples lost on penalty kicks and was eliminated from the tournament. After another unexcused absence by Maradona in Italy two weeks later, the club owner, Corrado Ferlaino, filed a breach of contract suit against the player, asking for damages of up to $5 million. Feeling the Pressure In his defense, Maradona said that he had asked Ferlaino to release him from his contract, which expires in 1993, more than two years ago. \"I just can't take the pressure of playing in Italy anymore,\" Maradona confessed in a television interview in December. \"The pressure of games, of practices, and of the newspapers, always talking about Maradona. It's not that I don't want to accept the responsibility. I can't. I can't be the person or the player I was.\" Worse was to come. On Feb. 13, the Italian weekly magazine Epoca reported that Maradona's name had come up during an investigation of drug trafficking and prostitution in Naples. Two days later, at his own request, Maradona was interrogated for three hours by the officials conducting the investigation. Maradona, who has two daughters, admitted to having solicited the services of prostitutes but denied having used cocaine. Staying in Villa One week after his testimony, he was informed by a Naples district attorney that he was under investigation for the possession and distribution of cocaine. \"I knew something like this would happen when I announced that I wanted to leave Naples,\" he said on the steps of the courthouse after his testimony. \"My lawyers will handle it.\"", "headline": {"main": "Soccer; Soccer Star Faces Suspension for Cocaine"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 901, "_id": "4fd19e1a8eb7c8105d6b0a99", "snippet": "  Diego Maradona, the world's most acclaimed soccer player, has been found to have used cocaine and is expected to be suspended from international play for as long as two years.

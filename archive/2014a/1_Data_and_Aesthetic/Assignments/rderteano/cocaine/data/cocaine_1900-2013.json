Mr. Hoffman said in an interview in the Manhattan office of a friend that he had instructed his lawyer, Gerald B. Lefcourt, to arrange his surrender on a 1974 charge that he had sold cocaine to undercover policemen. It was during pretrial hearings in that case that Mr. Hoffman, fearing that he faced possible conviction and a long prison term, decided to go underground."

His brother, Charles, and a brother-in-law, Michael Shure, who were charged with him, also pleaded guilty. John H. Martin, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the cocaine was bought by Charles Evans from an undercover narcotics agent on May 2. Robert Evans was in California at the time, but the authorities said he had agreed in a telephone conversation with his brother to split the $19,000 cost of about five ounces of the drug."

The cocaine was found in seven duffle bags in an abandoned twinengine Piper Cheyenne on the grounds of a mansion in Mossey Head, Fla., near Eglin Air Force Base and about 50 miles northeast of Pensacola."

Some officers have received millions of dollars for protecting traffickers or for trafficking themselves in the processed and semiprocessed cocaine leaving Bolivia, the source of most of the cocaine that reaches the United States, according to officials of the United States Drug Enforcement Agency. The junta now governing Bolivia stepped in three weeks ago when Gen. Luis Garcia Meza was forced to resign as President by a military rebellion, prompted in part by officers who had discovered the corruption. The junta has called for a ''return to morality,'' but two of its three members have themselves been charged with corruption in the past. U.S. Is Withholding Aid The Reagan Administration, meanwhile, is withholding appointing an Ambassador or giving the country badly needed economic aid because of the involvement of Government leaders in the cocaine traffic, Administration officials have said."

THE APPROPRIATION BILL FOR FINANCING FOREIGN AID FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WAS SCUTTLED LAST WEEK BY THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE WHEN INFORMAL TALKS WITH REPUBLICANS INDICATED THAT THE REQUESTED FUNDS WOULD RISK SHARP CUTBACKS IN A FLOOR DEBATE. FINANCING WILL BE PROVIDED BY A CONTINUNG RESOLUTION MAINTAINING THE SAME LEVEL OF AID FOR THE COMING YEAR AS DURING FISCAL 1980, WITH A FEW AMENDMENTS. AMENDMENTS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROPOSED AT A SENATE-HOUSE CONFERENCE ON A CONTINUING RESOLUTION WOULD INCLUDE ADDITIONAL MILITARY SALES CREDITS TO ISRAEL AND MORE MONEY FOR REFUGEE PROGRAMS THAT PUT A BURDEN ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES, SUCH AS THE SETTLING OF CUBAN AND HAITIAN REFUGEES IN FLORIDA.

''Everyone thought the drug dealers were just up on the Atlantic coast, but they've arrived here now,'' said Juan Fernandez Carasquilla, president of the Criminal Court. ''Medellin used to be a staging area, but now there are laboratories all over the city and it has become our domestic industry.'' To the visitor, this city of 1.2 million has the vibrancy of a onetime frontier town sure of its up-to-date importance. Men in rolled brim hats, cowboy boots and open-neck shirts mix comfortably on its broad streets with the business-suited executives who toil in the sleek skyscrapers that have risen over midtown."

Although cocaine is not a leading cause of drug-related deaths, in a number of cities, including bellwether San Francisco and New York, it is now the fastest-growing source of serious drug-related medical problems, according to epidemiologists for the National Institute on Drug Abuse who met last week in Washington. Behind the surge in health problems appears to be a growing tendency for users of the very expensive drug to take large doses in search of what the author William Burroughs called ''a rush of pure pleasure to the head.'' These doses are taken either by injecting the substance, like heroin, or by smoking a highly concentrated and chemically altered form called ''freebase,'' made by treating the white powder with ether."

Their investigation, officials say, is one of the first to penetrate the tightly knit world of Colombian narcotics trafficking, a world in which a rigid code of silence is enforced by murder. The task force's work has taken three years, and it is continuing. ''This investigation represented one of the most significant enforcement operations ever undertaken, because of the size, scope, sophistication and impact of the smuggling ring,'' said Peter B. Bensinger, outgoing head of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Mr. Bensinger, who established the investigation, is going to be removed by President Reagan, according to Justice Department officials, who said Friday that he had lobbied against budget cuts proposed for his agency. Imports Worth $200 Million a Year The case, which began three years ago with an unexceptional arrest on a quiet street in Queens, led agents to Miami, Atlanta, Baltimore, Tucson, Ariz., and Philadelphia and interdicted a conspiracy that used bogus companies to import pure cocaine worth at least $200 million a year, according to law enforcement authorities. In the course of it, the agents seized an arsenal of weapons ranging from delicate silver derringers to rifles with telescopic sights and machine guns equipped with silencers."

Police investigators in Los Angeles contend that cocaine and other drugs are sold routinely on many film and television production sets. Drug dealers, some of them riding in chauffeured limousines, make regular rounds to the homes of executives, performers and technicians in the film, television and rock music industries, some of whom are spending as much as $1 million a year on cocaine. Grand Jury Investigates Federal agents allege that William Morgan Hetrick, who was indicted Friday on cocaine trafficking charges with John Z. De Lorean, the former executive of the General Motors Corporation, was among the major suppliers of cocaine to the Hollywood entertainment industry before his arrest. Mr. Hetrick, who has denied complicity in any illicit drug dealing, is a 50-year-old former resident of Ventura County who was a pilot and operator of a three-plane flying service at a small-town airport in the Mojave Desert."

Although no one knows how much money is involved, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that more than $30 billion is spent annually by cocaine users in this country. The smuggling and distribution of the drug, officials say, are largely controlled by Colombians and other Latin Americans, as well as organized crime in this country. But they say the trade is so lucrative, the chances of being caught are so small and the use of the drug has become so acceptable in some segments of American society that it is increasingly attracting dealers from middle-class professional and business life. ''It's greed,'' said Charles Palmer, a senior Drug Enforcement Administration agent in San Francisco. ''Cocaine is a multibilliondollar industry, and it's polluting all levels of society, from the lower classes to the very affluent. The affluent are going into it because there are such incredible amounts of money.''"

Mr. Gomez was convicted May 20, 1982, and is serving a 20-year sentence in the Federal prison at Lompoc, Calif. Other targets of the plot, according to the indictment, were Assistant United States Attorney William S. Farmer, who prosecuted Mr. Gomez; Lowrey Leong, an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration; Stephen Green, Mr. Gomez's son-in-law and a convicted cocaine dealer who cooperated with the Government investigation, and Bobby Sharp, who is reportedly cooperating with the authorities while awaiting trial on drug charges."

One looks much too tired, as he is barely able to walk off the field when the ball changes hands. Then the camera takes in the sideline, and Dr. Riker spots a player on the bench. He is much too jittery at this point in the game, his legs beating a staccato on the planking beneath him. Dr. Riker begins to suspect the worst. For Carl Eller of the Minnesota Vikings, one of the most intimidating defensive ends, five times an all-pro, it is the worst. Glaring at him from the other side of the scrimmage line was Claudie Minor, an offensive tackle for the Denver Broncos whom Eller said he had dominated for years. But now Minor was making him look bad."

Charles S. Jackson, the league's assistant director of security and drug abuse and a former undercover narcotics agent for the Yonkers Police Department, said he doubted that cocaine use had reached epidemic levels, as some officials fear. He said there was ''absolutely no evidence thus far'' that gambling interests had succeeded in using cocaine to corrupt the game. But he also said that ''the longer the problem of cocaine continues to grow, the greater the chance of it occurring.'' Mr. Jackson and other league officials said that only 17 players had been identified as ''chemically dependent'' on cocaine. But Mr. Jackson said in an interview that ''it was quite possible'' that as many as 40 to 50 players in the league had a ''chemical dependency on the drug'' and that hundreds of the league's 1,500 players were using it, many of them regularly."

The Federal health agency, citing a report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, also said that nearly 10 million people over 11 years old reported using cocaine in 1978-79, more than double the number of users the previous year. The agency's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report cited figures compiled by the Drug Abuse Warning Network showing that the number of deaths linked to cocaine increased from 4.5 per 10,000 medical examiner reports to 19.1 deaths per 10,000 reports from 1976 to 1981."

Justice Roberts rescheduled the trial for June 1. The conversation was first disclosed Wednesday when Justice Roberts, while questioning prospective jurors, told them that ''the names of one or more of the New York Yankees'' were on the tape and asked them whether this would influence them in deciding the case."

The Los Angeles Times reported today that a source in the coroner's office had said that Mr. Belushi died of complications from an overdose of cocaine. A local television station, KABC, gave a similar report, quoting a source identified only as close to the coroner's office. According to medical specialists on the abuse of drugs, excessive doses of cocaine can be fatal, although such deaths have been relatively rare."

Carlos Lehder, who is wanted by United States authorities for his part in the drug traffic, is addressing a political rally in Colombia, denouncing his country's extradition treaty with the United States as a trick. A moment later, in an interview, he says that in resisting extradition he is ''fighting for the rights of my people.'' It is an interesting commentary on politics and international crime. The documentary will be seen tomorrow night at 10 on Channel 7. The documentary's principal interest lies in what it calls ''the new Mafia,'' the dozen or so Colombian families, or organizations, which it identifies as the managers of the cocaine trade. One Colombian, Pablo Escobar, is reported to be worth nearly $2 billion. He is said to own several ranches, a zoo and a small fleet of planes and helicopters. He is also said to have financed free housing for the poor. In a brief interview, Mr. Escobar defends the use of ill- gotten money."

In 1972, before what would have been his third season at Dallas, Duane Thomas pleaded guilty of marijuana possession and was given a five-year probated sentence; three months later he was traded to the San Diego Chargers. In 1973, Lance Rentzel, a former Cowboy wide receiver, also pleaded guilty of possession of marijuana, and was sentenced to 90 days in jail. In 1978, four years after his retirement, Bob Hayes, a former wide receiver, was convicted of selling cocaine; he was sentenced to five years in prison, though he served less than one. John Niland, a guard from 1966 to 1974, will soon be tried in Dallas on charges of cocaine possession."

Junior, the Cardinal linebacker who pleaded guilty to cocaine-possession charges earlier this year in Alabama, were investigating the possibility of appealing the suspension to the league office. ''I don't know if we have the standing to appeal,'' Bob Wallace, a Cardinals club attorney, said from St. Louis. ''We're still discussing it. The suspension came without warning; it was sort of a surprise to us. The club had been happy with everything E.J. has done from the point of his arrest. We felt that he had taken what we considered were the proper steps toward rehabilitation.''"

Junior, a linebacker for the St. Louis Cardinals, and Greg Stemrick, a cornerback recently acquired by the New Orleans Saints from the Houston Oilers. ''After thoroughly reviewing the respective cases and meeting with the players and their representatives,'' the commissioner said in a harshly worded statement, ''I have determined that each player, due to his participation in illegal activities involving cocaine, will be suspended without pay through the fourth game of the 1983 regular season. None of the four players is permitted to attend training camp, practice sessions, meetings or otherwise use club facilities. All four will be eligible to petition for reinstatement following the fourth game of the '83 regular season.''"

With that simple phrase, John Drew introduces himself on this day - and every other one - to the other addicts at a gathering of Alcoholics Anonymous, which also counsels drug addicts. He is addicted to cocaine, and has been, he says, ever since he began freebasing, which involves cooking the drug until it reaches its purest form, three years ago. He'd snorted it for two years before that. ''I tried something, and liked it,'' he says. ''And by liking it, it almost destroyed me.'' It came very close to destroying his career in pro basketball. Last Nov. 22, at the beginning of Drew's ninth National Basketball Association season - his first with the Utah Jazz - he received a telephone call at 7 A.M. while he was asleep in a hotel room in Cleveland. It was Dan Sparks, the team trainer."

Policemen led by Interior Under Secretary Gustavo Sanches left this mountain city Saturday afternoon on a military airplane for Beni Province, the low region just north of the Chapare where most of Bolivia's cocaine is processed and shipped to foreign markets."

The trial lasted 22 weeks. Jurors Saw Entrapment But some of the jurors said the Government had failed to prove its case; others said the undercover investigation had sometimes slipped over the line into entrapment.

The affidavit, sworn testimony by an agent of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, Ernest S. Jacobson, said the Sandinista Government, in cooperation with a Colombian drug dealer, had recently built a new airstrip and hangar in Managua for use by cocaine traffickers. It also said a Nicaraguan Government official had been encouraging smugglers to begin using a new cocaine laboratory recently built in Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan official said he wanted the smugglers to begin flying cocaine base from Bolivia to Nicaragua, where cocaine would be manufactured and then would be flown to the United States, the affidavit said."

DeLorean's personal secretary and housekeeper at his New Jersey estate was arrested Wednesday evening in a motel in Clinton Township, N.J., along with three other people, on charges of trafficking in cocaine. The arrests sent another jolt through the DeLorean trial here. The secretary, Cynthia Lee Brady, 30 years old, was arrested when she returned to a room at the Fountain Motel after the motel manager, Ray Counterman, alerted the police that he had found drug paraphernalia in her room. The Hunterdon County prosecutor, William Paleria, said half an ounce of cocaine that had been separated into 14 individual packages had been seized along with less than an ounce of marijuana. Mr. Paleria said, ''This office has no evidence suggesting a link in this narcotics investigation with John DeLorean.''"

With their allowances, they buy cocaine and they ''party'' on weekends, sometimes in their rooms at their exclusive Massachusetts preparatory school and sometimes in the discotheques of New York or Boston. ''It used to be such a big thing to have it,'' says a 16-year-old girl. ''Now everyone's so blase.''"

The cocaine trade's move into the Brazilian lowlands from its traditional havens in the Andean mountains of Bolivia, Peru and Colombia is a major expansion of the drug network supplying the United States, the officials said. They added that cocaine operators were active in the Amazon region before Colombia and Peru began their largest antidrug campaigns ever this month, but they suggested that diversification into Brazil may have been planned in anticipation of tougher enforcement. As the Brasilia Government is beginning to recognize the potential dimensions of its narcotics problems, it has been in touch with Colombia and Peru to coordinate regional police efforts. A meeting of representatives of the three countries is planned here next week."

For Federal investigators, cocaine has become the top-priority drug, and official estimates indicate nearly half the country's supply is smuggled from Latin America aboard small, private aircraft. The Customs Service is responsible for interdicting those flights, which may have numbered nearly 18,000 last year. But in 1983, Customs estimates indicate, the air program probably intercepted only one smuggler's flight of every 100. Meanwhile, R. T. McNamar, Deputy Treasury Secretary, and Customs Commissioner William von Raab, say they have decided that the service, a part of the Treasury Department, should no longer be responsible for the key element in the airborne drug war: detecting the aircraft."

These conclusions are drawn by researchers who have interviewed or talked briefly with thousands of callers on a ''cocaine helpline,'' a telephone service set up to offer advice to the nation's five million cocaine users and to people asking questions about cocaine-related problems. The researchers now report receiving about 1,000 calls a day nationwide. Medical and social difficulties appear to be particularly acute among people who take the drug intranasally - that is, by inhaling it through the nose. About half of the people interviewed who said they took the drug intranasally reported feelings of paranoia and panic, considered themselves to be addicted and experienced withdrawal symptoms when they stopped using cocaine."

''That doesn't mean we're denigrating heroin, but it's not the only problem anymore and so we have to change our priorities,'' said Robert M. Stutman, special agent in charge of the agency's office in New York. Mr. Stutman six weeks ago replaced Bruce M. Jensen, who retired. In November, according to Mr. Stutman, 2,200 pounds of cocaine were seized by the agency in the metropolitan region, most of it during raids in Long Island and New Jersey suburbs. While large seizures are not a measure of the agency's success, Mr. Stutman said, the size of the recent raids is one indication of the growing cocaine problem."

Mr. Fox, whose Greenwich-based company is one of the nation's largest makers of liquor, specialty foods and vitamins, was arrested here Nov. 6. He and Barbara Phelan, a 38-year-old Hartford resident, were escorted in handcuffs from a Hartford hotel suite where the police said they found 17 grams of cocaine and drug paraphernalia. Both Mr. Fox and Miss Phelan have pleaded not guilty. Richard Brown, a Hartford attorney who is representing them, filed a motion Monday in Hartford Superior Court to have the charges dismissed on the ground that the police had insufficient evidence to enter and search Mr. Fox's hotel room. Mr. Fox has declined to be interviewed, and Mr. Brown said he would have no other statement on the case."

The substance, known as crack, is already processed into the purified form that enables cocaine users to smoke, or free-base, the powerful stimulant of the central nervous system. Previously, free-basers had to reduce cocaine powder themselves to its unadulterated form by combining it with baking soda or ether and evaporating the resulting paste over a flame. Since crack appeared on the streets of the Bronx last year, spreading throughout the city and its suburbs, new cocaine users have graduated more quickly from inhaling to free-basing, the most addictive form of cocaine abuse. In addition, dealers in crack have found a ready market in people reluctant to intensify their intake by intravenous injection of cocaine because of the fear of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a fatal affliction that is spread by contaminated needles."

          "lead_paragraph": "THREE years ago the director of research and treatment at Regent Hospital in Manhattan, Dr. Arnold M. Washton, developed a curative program for cocaine abusers that he described as the first such specialized private drug-treatment program in New York City. Now he is duplicating that model here in Westchester, where, he says, there is considerable need for it. The program, consisting primarily of outpatient services, is conducted at The Recovery Center, affiliated with and located at Stony Lodge Hospital in Ossining, a private psychiatric hospital recently re-opened under new leadership. Dr. Washton is best known for his work with the National Cocaine Hotline, 800-COCAINE, which he helped to establish with Dr. Mark S. Gold. Dr. Gold is research director at Stony Lodge Hospital under the new team there. Apart from its specific focus on cocaine abuse, The Recovery Center will serve people who want help in stopping any kind of drug abuse. Treatment is now being offered as part of Dr. Washton's outpatient psychiatric practice; Dr. Washton said he hoped the program would obtain full licensing from the state, which would allow it to expand, in the coming months. He added he has already been ''swamped'' with county residents requesting help."

Our folk heroes have substituted clay feet for the customary spiked shoes. Enjoying an immunity from prosecution, they are freely disclosing their own past use of the drug, and in addition, pushing their buddies out of the cocaine closets around the country's ball parks. Even the venerable Willie Mays has been ''fingered'' by a former teammate. Do these confessions add up to a new drug scandal? Unhappily, I would have to answer yes. What we see in baseball today is the tip of the iceberg, part of an American cocaine epidemic of the 1980's. Perhaps the shocking spectacle of cocaine's infiltration into our national pastime will help prompt us to take drastic measures to stop the widespread use of the drug."

Agents for the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration say the leads will probably result in the indictment of people suspected of awaiting delivery of the cocaine. The first lead came when the police found an address book in Mr. Thornton's belongings. The book had names and phone numbers that provided a guide to the investigators."

At the moment, the inquiry into the use of cocaine among baseball players has placed that particular mood-altering drug in the headlines. ''High on the Job,'' a documentary on Channel 5/WNEW-TV at 9 o'clock tonight, may be even more valuable than the articles that are full of famous names because it concentrates on the effect of cocaine on millions of Americans whose names are not household words. These people are known only to their disrupted families and to their fellow workers on jobs made more dangerous by their addiction."

Milner, 35 years old and now unemployed, followed six active players who testified that they had purchased cocaine from Strong in recent years. He was the first to say he had bought the drug in a baseball clubhouse. All seven players have received immunity from prosecution. Milner also said that Willie Mays kept a bottle of ''red juice,'' or amphetamine pills dissolved in liquid, in his locker when the two played for the Mets in the early 1970's. Mays, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1979, retired after the 1973 season."

The United States Attorney for Connecticut, Alan H. Nevas, said the unsuccessful scheme would have marked the seventh time since 1982 that cocaine had been imported from Caracas, Venezuela, and distributed among students at the private boarding school in Wallingford. ''The use of cocaine at Choate in 1984 was very widespread,'' Mr. Nevas said. A grand jury has subpoenaed school officials in connection with a continuing cocaine investigation, he said."

Parker, who played for the Pirates from 1973 to 1983, when he signed as a free agent with the Reds, acknowledged under frequently intense questioning that he had used cocaine from 1976 to 1982. He also said he had made it possible for his ''primary supplier'' to get into the Pirates' clubhouse at Three Rivers Stadium and to fly on the same plane with the Pirates when they traveled to other cities so drugs could be delivered to him and other players in those cities. The players who bought and used the drug at 1980 meetings he arranged, Parker said, included Dusty Baker, Derrell Thomas and Steve Howe, who were with the Los Angeles Dodgers at the time, and Enos Cabell and J. R. Richard, who were with the Houston Astros then. In addition, Parker said he introduced some of his teammates on the Pirates to a drug dealer and claimed to have used cocaine with six current and former members of the Pirates."

''That was the year I was crazy the second half, the time of my greatest use,'' he said. The statements came 24 hours after Lonnie Smith, an outfielder with the Kansas City Royals, testified that five players, including Mr. Hernandez and Joaquin Andujar, the St. Louis Cardinals' star pitcher, had used cocaine. Mr. Hernandez, 31 years old, discussing his cocaine use as a member of the Cardinals, said he had used the drug with Mr. Smith, Mr. Andujar, Bernie Carbo and Lary Sorensen. He said that there were other players involved but that he could not recall their names."

Two weeks ago the police moved into a jungle area near the Colombian border and seized four cocaine-processing installations and adjacent airstrips. The raids were financed by the United States, and Colombian helicopters ferried Peruvian policemen to the site. But it was the Garcia administration that provided the crucial political decision to go ahead. Some officials and diplomats here believe that the police raids may mark a turning point for Peru as important as the crackdown in Colombia that followed the slaying of that country's Justice Minister, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, by drug traffickers on April 30, 1984."

          "lead_paragraph": "Cocaine use among baseball players has been so pervasive in recent years that the drug's debilitating effects have tarnished individual performances, shortened careers and influenced the outcome of games and pennant races, club officials and players say. John McHale, president of the Montreal Expos, said cocaine was the reason his team did not win its division championship in 1982, when the team generally was considered to be the best in the National League. ''I don't think there's any doubt in '82 that whole scenario cost us a chance to win,'' McHale said. ''We felt we should've won in '82. When we all woke up to what was going on, we found there were at least eight players on our club who were into this thing. There's no question in my mind and Jim Fanning's mind - he was managing the club that year - that cost us a chance to win.''"

However, the players generally have not been prosecuted, and in some cases law enforcement officials have taken unusual steps to protect the players' identities. Court documents and interviews with more than 100 players, baseball executives and law-enforcement officials during a three-month investigation by The New York Times also uncovered the following facts: * Players representing nearly all 26 major league teams have been named in connection with cocaine use in criminal cases across the country, with some teams having several players named. * In at least four cities, drug dealers or their couriers had access to baseball clubhouses and conducted sales there. * The practice of shielding players from prosecution and identification has caused resentment among some defense lawyers, who feel that their clients have become scapegoats."

And they expect that improved smuggling strategies and unrelenting demand will keep the record-breaking flow coming. The officials said Miami was the center of cocaine traffic in this country, adding that about three-quarters of the cocaine intercepted nationwide last year was seized in the Florida-Caribbean district of the Drug Enforcement Administratioon. With a long coast and thousands of unused airstrips, south Florida has for years been the main point of entry of cocaine into the United States, which, according to recent statistics, has seen a dramatic increase in cocaine use at all social and economic levels. The officials, interviewed over several months, cited a shift from the use of large ships and airplanes for transporting cocaine to a wave of smaller boats and planes. They say this makes interception harder and, as one official said, ''overwhelms our interdiction resources.''"

The project begins tonight at 10 with a remarkably close-in look at the processing and sale of the drug in its earlier stages. The hour combines anthropology, chemistry and human interest in an adventurous mix. The family referred to in the title ''Colombia: A Small Family Business'' is small all right - a man, his wife and their two sons - but their business has ramifications. Its head is Eliseo, who after a failed career as a rubber grower has staked out a patch of remote Colombian jungle to become a maker of cocaine - ''the most dangerous yet the most lucrative way of earning one's living.'' Eliseo is a pioneer, a trader, a scientist, a promoter, a philosopher. ''Here in the jungle I saw a freer life; it has no evil.''"

Ten Colombian nationals were arrested in the raids, and authorities seized large quantities of arms and chemicals used in converting cocaine base to cocaine, as well as sophisticated equipment used to monitor activity by the police and agents of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Officials said the laboratories indicated that cocaine traffickers had significantly changed their strategy by moving their manufacturing bases from Latin America to the United States. The raids were announced at the Federal Courthouse in Uniondale, L.I., by Raymond J. Dearie, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District; Michael R. Priore, director of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Long Island, and the District Attorneys for Nassau and Suffolk Counties, Denis Dillon and Patrick Henry, respectively."

The suspects were all believed to be part of a ring headed by a Philadelphia dentist, Dr. Lawrence Lavin, who was indicted along with 13 others in September, Mr. Dennis said. Dr. Lavin fled after his release on bail and remains a fugitive."

But as Spain tries to assess the political and economic effects of joining the European Economic Community, as agreed in Brussels late last month, a dramatic social transformation is drawing the country closer to the rest of Western Europe. The popular Spanish images depicted by writers such as Ernest Hemingway and George Orwell have not disappeared. But over the last two decades, and particularly since the death of the dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, Spaniards have been casting off nearly four centuries of isolationism."

Cocaine, in fact, is all over the country. In both quantity and dollar amounts of sales, it long ago surpassed heroin as the illegal hard drug of choice. Not only that, but because of the increased tonnage of the powder being smuggled into the country, the price has dropped from $125 a gram in 1981 to as low as $70 now. Which means, obviously, that young people can get their hands on it more easily."

More women are turning up at drug treatment centers and self- help groups looking for a way out. The motivations for using cocaine and the repercussions of its use appear in some ways to be dramatically different for women than for men. But physicians and social workers are just beginning to undertake clinical studies, and the picture of the female abuser that is emerging is often confusing. Despite the preliminary nature of these studies, and even though no one yet knows exactly how many American women are using the drug, the results indicate that cocaine abuse is a growing problem for women."

At $119 million, they said, the plane was the largest single asset ever seized by the agency, which is empowered by Federal law to confiscate planes, ships and other conveyences used by smugglers. Meanwhile, the Government of Colombia announced that it was investigating the circumstances of the seizure. In a terse statement released by the Colombian Embassy in Washington, it said it ''deplored the publicity- oriented display which the U.S. Customs Commissioner set up in reference to these events, which are seriously detrimental to the good image of Colombia as a committed ally of the U.S. in the all-out war against drug trafficking.''"

''That's a lot of drugs,'' Robert M. Stutman, special agent of the drug agency, said as the stood by a table piled high with plastic bags filled with white powder, which he said had a street value of $35 million. The key person arrested in the ring is a 37-year-old California resident who began smuggling cocaine while attending the University of Tennessee, Mr. Stutman said at a news conference in Manhattan. He said the operation was responsible for smuggling some 200 pounds of cocaine into the United States every month over the past 10 years. He declined to estimate how much of the total cocaine market the ring controlled."

Washington saw no interest in maintaining the repressive Garcia Meza Government. Now, however, United States officials hesitate to draw attention to possible drug connections in some sectors of President Victor Paz Estenssoro's year-old Government. They support his efforts to resolve longstanding economic and political woes. And the Government has cooperated in such enforcement efforts as the recently ended operation that used United States Army helicopters to go after cocaine processing plants and clandestine shipping points."

The 28-count indictment, handed up in the Federal Courthouse in Uniondale, L.I., accused the two officers, James R. Kuhn and Raymond Gutowski, both 36 years old, of conspiracy and numerous violations of Federal narcotics laws from October 1983 through August 1985. Neither was accused of selling drugs. Both men were undercover detectives with the narcotics squad until they were reassigned late last year."

The results of drug tests regularly administered to patients in New York's methadone maintenance programs indicate that 35 percent of the people in the programs are now using cocaine. Some researchers, in fact, say methadone maintenance programs might actually increase the likelihood that former heroin addicts will try cocaine. The issue is of particular concern in New York, where the majority of state-financed programs treat addiction with methadone, an orally administered drug that stops the craving for heroin but is ineffective in treating cocaine addiction. Of 43,000 people in state-financed treatment programs in New York, 33,000 are in methadone maintenance programs."

''Grams of coke are $80,'' he says. ''My name's Joey, man. You want something, you come back to me.'' At Area, a club at 157 Hudson Street, five men and women stand in a circle in the blue shadowy light of the men's room, passing a vial and cocaine spoon from hand to hand. An attendant looks on from 15 feet away. Such scenes are not hard to find in late-night rock clubs, where cocaine use since the 1970's has been so open, institutionalized, and free from fear of management or the police that it is regarded by many New Yorkers as a convention of the city's night life."

A new national survey expected to be made public in the next few weeks will show how drug use patterns have changed since the early 1980's. The poll, a survey of households issued by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, is coming on top of several recent national surveys showing that use of most illicit drugs except cocaine has declined in the last several years. The institute, which is the Federal agency responsible for research into drug abuse, says drug use peaked in 1979. Daily marijuana use among high school seniors, for example, is now less than half what it was in 1979, the agency says. Its last household survey on drug abuse was completed in 1982."

The need for systematic study of different treatments has become urgent with the surge in use of crack, the experts said. Purer than cocaine powder and smoked rather than snorted, crack produces more intense highs than the powdered form, followed by more intense lows. It leads to addiction faster and in more cases. But no one knows why some cocaine or crack users become addicted, how many stop on their own or with the aid of self-help groups, and what proportion of those who enter treatment programs stay off the drug for good, said an authority on addictions, Dr. Herbert D. Kleber of Yale University."

Mr. Greelish said at a news conference that five people, believed to be illegal aliens from Colombia, were arrested and were being arraigned today on charges of conspiracy and facilitating an illegal drug enterprise."

The judge ruled, however, that the police did not have ''probable cause'' to search Mr. Zaccaro's car, and thus he held that the six to eight grams of cocaine seized from the vehicle was not admissible as evidence. The prosecutor, John Quinn, said that the judge's ruling would ''slightly damage'' his case against Mr. Zaccaro for drug possession but would not affect a separate charge of selling cocaine."

Days earlier, the police seized 700 pounds of cocaine being smuggled into Phoenix, and 1,253 pounds in West Palm Beach, Fla. In the last few weeks, law-enforcement authorities working in at least 15 states have seized more than 6,000 pounds of cocaine, nearly a month's supply for the United States. And, Bolivian authorities working with the United States Army say they have ended cocaine production in that country, at least temporarily, through raids over the last six weeks. It is estimated that these raids have cut off 20 percent to 40 percent of the United States' cocaine supply. But even with all this cocaine being kept off the American market, enforcement officials say that the price of the drug has not risen and that cocaine remains widely available on the streets."

The largest amount of cocaine previously cited in a Federal drug case was five tons in a 1984 indictment in Atlanta. The indictment charged that the defendants used a Scranton-based airplane repair company, Air America Inc., to import the drugs and to fly the profits back to Colombia, where officials said the ring was based."

Indeed, little information on the cardiovascular effects of cocaine appeared until recently."

It would also reduce the muggings and burglaries committed to obtain drugs, which by most estimates account for about 70 percent of such crimes."

The investigation, which over seven years has turned up networks of safe houses, millions of dollars in drugs and cash and detailed financial ledgers, has given new insights into the shadowy but giant cocaine trade in New York, they say. The Colombian, identified as Jose Santa Cruz Londono, who is a fugitive, commands a network that reaches from his bases in Cali and Bogota to the street corners of Jackson Heights and Corona, Queens, where his distributors exchange shopping bags stuffed with cocaine for bags filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, they say. The operation is so sophisticated, authorities said, that customers can buy insurance from Mr. Santa Cruz to cover costs in case a shipment is seized by the police. Armies of Dealers In addition to Mr. Santa Cruz's organization, law-enforcement officials said, at least five other Colombian cartels supply the cocaine business in New York, an industry that makes more than $10 billion a year and employs thousands of illegal aliens."

Citing the recent deaths of two athletes, Len Bias and Don Rogers, the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported a sharp increase in cocaine-related deaths and emergency-room admissions in the last few years. The officials said, nonetheless, that they had no evidence of a recent rise in cocaine use. ''What we are seeing in 1986 are the consequences of drug use which began years ago,'' said Donald I. Macdonald, head of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration."

Morgenthau of Manhattan accused the Federal Government yesterday of making only ''a minimal effort'' to fight cocaine in the New York area at a time when the region is being overwhelmed by what he called a cocaine epidemic. In a sweeping criticism of Federal antidrug activities by four Federal agencies and the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan, Mr. Morgenthau said the Federal officials were giving the appearance of great activity but doing little to stop the flood of cocaine into the New York area. His criticism came one day after the United States Attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, went to Washington Heights to purchase crack, the highly potent form of cocaine, from street drug dealers. The move, which Mr. Morgenthau characterized as ''cosmetic,'' received widespread publicity."

The compilation was made public at a news conference today. Many of those people died of heart problems as a result of cocaine use, and the Government said it issued the statistics because of the publicity resulting from the recent cocaine-related deaths of Len Bias, the University of Maryland basketball star, and of Don Rogers, a defensive back for the Cleveland Browns football team. Both athletes were found to have died of cardiac arrest as a result of cocaine intoxication."

The illicit use of many other drugs fell by half over the period from 1980 to 1985, the survey reported. Dr. Lloyd D. Johnston, a director of the study, said in a statement: ''The drug epidemic largely originated on the nation's campuses in the late 1960's, so it is significant to see evidence that it is receding on those same campuses."

Tschiffely rode the length of the Andes, Paul Theroux traveled the trains of Patagonia, and Dervla Murphy walked Pizarro's route across Peru. Such were the themes of some of South America's greatest travel writers. They seem conventional beside the Grail that inspired Charles Nicholl's journeys in Colombia - he was sent by his trendy publisher to write the Great Cocaine Story. It all started 12 years before that, when Mr. Nicholl was spending his nights in a hammock in the yard of a seedy fruit-juice parlor called the Fruit Palace in the Caribbean port of Santa Marta, Colombia. He had his first brushes with the traffic that keeps such dusty places going when a beautiful young Canadian woman lured him to a phony assignation and he found himself interpreting for a sweating gringo trying to buy five kilos of cocaine for $50,000."

''And that's despite the good work being done here,'' Mr. Stutman said. ''Westchester has a good ongoing program, one of the best in the state.'' The training program for 45 local officers will begin in the fall, with a closed preliminary session set for next Wednesday."

Pathologists have recognized only recently that cocaine can kill by throwing the heart into an irregular rhythm, and they believe that most such deaths may be misreported simply as cocaine overdoses, in which massive depression of the nervous system can lead to cessation of breathing. Although research has intensified over the last year, scientists do not know how much cocaine is likely to cause such deaths or precisely what mechanisms are at work. ''There are sudden deaths coming into emergency rooms around the clock now,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Rosecan of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and director of the Cocaine Abuse Treatment program at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. ''I'm amazed at the tolerance some people have for cocaine, yet for others it's playing Russian roulette.''"

Dr. John Smialek, the examiner, said the intoxication interrupted the electrical activity in Bias's brain and caused his heart to beat irregularly. ''This resulted in the sudden onset of seizures and cardiac arrest,'' he said. The findings of an autopsy report, announced this afternoon, left unanswered the question whether the death will be considered a homicide or an accident. The report was turned over to Arthur A. Marshall Jr., the Prince Georges County State's Attorney."

The crack epidemic has spawned a debate among government officials and drug abuse experts over whether the state has done enough to cope with the highly addictive drug, whose use has spread dramatically in the last six months, particularly among teen-agers. Critics assert that New York State's system of drug treatment programs -established more than a decade ago to treat heroin addicts - does not have enough spaces or the right kind of programs to handle a new wave of crack addicts. ''The state has been outrageously neglectful in dealing with the cocaine threat and failing to provide aid to thousands of New Yorkers who need it,'' said State Senator Roy M. Goodman, the Manhattan Republican whose Committee on Investigations and Taxation has been studying the cocaine problem since 1983. ''They are fiddling while Rome burns.''"

As a result of the allegations, 1 of the 11 has been suspended and 2 others have been transferred to new posts. While members of the department have expressed growing concern about the use of drugs by younger officers in recent years, Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said recently that cocaine use by some officers was a symptom of the rising use and acceptance of the drug by society generally and does not represent a widespread problem for the department. The chief of the department's Inspectional Services Bureau, which conducted an investigation of the charges, said yesterday that the new allegations do not indicate organized drug dealing or corruption in the department. Seven members of the force of 25,800 were arrested on drug charges last year, according to the police."

The commissioner called it ''a tragic day for Micheal Ray Richardson, nothing less than the destruction by cocaine of a once-flourishing career.'' The action can be appealed after two years, and Richardson could be reinstated with the approval of the league and the National Basketball Players Association, the players' union. Charles Grantham, Richardson's agent and the executive vice president of the player's union, said that his client had denied taking drugs."

In Dr. Yoon's nursery one recent afternoon eight babies were withdrawing from drugs, seven of them born to women who said they had used cocaine either alone or in combination with other toxic substances. These mothers are among the two million women who, experts estimate, regularly use cocaine. Physicians fear that many women underestimate the dangers of cocaine, and that their babies, like those of the heroin addicts who preceded them, will suffer developmental and neurological problems."

The Bolivian, Jorge Roca Suarez, was ordered to stand trial on Feb. 5. Also pleading not guilty and ordered to stand trial with him were his wife, Cirila Roca; two sisters, Vilma Roca and Reatriz Roca Torres, and two alleged associates, Antonia Carillo and Emilio Diaz. Mr. Roca Suarez, 38 years old, was arrested 11 days ago at his 19-room house in San Marino in Southern California, and is being held without bail. Federal Magistrate Joseph Reichmann denied a request by Sylvan Daroca, a defense lawyer, to postpone arraignment until Jan. 14 so that Mr. Roca Torres could hire another lawyer. Mr. Daroca said he had been hired only for Mr. Roca Suarez's initial court appearance Friday. A court-appointed lawyer represented Mr. Roca Suarez on Monday. John Gibbons, an Assistant United States Attorney, said Friday that Mr. Roca Suarez and 19 others were accused of sending $50 million to $60 million in drug profits to Bolivia."

In returning its verdicts Tuesday, the jury also deadlocked on charges against three other defendants, favoring conviction by 8 to 4. Prosecutors said they would seek a retrial for these three, and a hearing was scheduled for Nov. 19. The three who were convicted of conspiracy and of possession with intent to distribute cocaine were Carlos Tapia Ponce, 69 years old, and his two sons-in-law, Jose Ignacio Mauricio Monroy Iniguez, 37, and James Romero McTague, 42. Each could be sentenced to 10 years to life in prison and fined up to $4 million. Sentencing was set for Jan. 28. In the trial, which started on Sept. 19, prosecutors characterized Mr. Tapia, a retired Mexican customs inspector, as \"the overseer and patriarch\" of a drug-trafficking ring that used tractor-trailers to ship 77 tons of cocaine from El Paso to Sylmar, a Los Angeles suburb where 20 tons of the drug were found in a raid on a warehouse in September 1989."

Manuel Antonio Noriega last week when it seemed as if the Medellin cartel had at one time or another worked hand in glove with every government in the Western Hemisphere during the 1980's. To hear one of the founders of the drug cartel tell it from the witness stand, everyone from Fidel Castro to American intelligence operatives performed favors for the Colombian drug syndicate -- giving Panama's deposed dictator plenty of company in the rogue's gallery of cartel accomplices. The testimony of Carlos Lehder Rivas, a former head of transportation for the Medellin cartel who is now serving life plus 135 years in an American prison, was the climax of the prosecution's case against General Noriega, who has been charged with 10 counts of cocaine trafficking, money laundering and racketeering. But Mr. Lehder's most sensational and potentially damaging statements had to do with what he described as assistance by the Cuban and Nicaraguan governments in smuggling cocaine into the United States and back-channel approaches by American officials willing to let him run cocaine into Florida if he would only help them ship weapons to the Nicaraguan contras."

Investigators picked up clues about the laboratory from a small-time dealer who had been selling to young professionals in the town of North Plainfield, N.J. That led to the arrest of three Colombians near Newburgh, N.Y., on Sunday; a raid on a warehouse in South Florida on Monday; the arrest of a man thought to be the leader of the group as he parked his BMW at a Holiday Inn in Manhattan Thursday night -- and the seizure of the laboratory in Pleasant Valley yesterday afternoon."

          "lead_paragraph": "Diego Maradona, the world's most acclaimed soccer player, has been found to have used cocaine and is expected to be suspended from international play for as long as two years. A laboratory analysis conducted yesterday in Rome confirmed the results of a previous test in which traces of the drug were found in his urine sample, taken after a game on March 17 in Bari, Italy. Maradona, a 30-year-old professional from Argentina, has played for the Naples team in the Italian league since 1984. The announcement of the test results was made by the Italian Soccer Federation, which will set the length of suspension next week. According to the rules of the international federation for soccer, which are far more strict than those governing drug offenses in American professional sports leagues, a first offense for cocaine use would mean an automatic two-year suspension. For Maradona, the maximum penalty would mean he would be 32 years old, and beyond his prime, before he returned to soccer. Any penalty would apply in all 154 countries affiliated with the international body, the Federation Internationale de Football Association, commonly known by the acronym FIFA. By comparison, a player in the National Football League would have to fail tests for cocaine three times before being suspended indefinitely, with the right of review after one year. Others Tarnished by Drug While Maradona is hardly the first professional athlete to have been linked to cocaine use, he is easily the most famous. Other athletes whose careers have been tarnished include such notable American stars as Dwight Gooden of the Mets and Dexter Manley of the Washington Redskins. In addition, the 1986 death of Len Bias, a basketball star from the University of Maryland, was ruled to be related to cocaine use. A product of the Buenos Aires slums who made as much as $3 million in annual salary and three times that in commercial endorsements, Maradona nurtured his legend with his stunning control of the ball, crackling maneuverability and a powerful left foot as dangerous scoring goals as setting them up with impossible passes. In 1986, as national team captain, he led Argentina to the World Cup championship in Mexico. In the same role last summer in Italy, he wept openly when Germany defeated Argentina in the final. He also led Naples to its first two championships in the Italian club league, in 1987 and 1990, the equivalent of Super Bowl victories, and in 1989 to victory in the even more prestigious European club championship. But Maradona's flamboyance extended beyond the soccer fields and made him one of the world's most prominent sports celebrities. His wedding reception two years ago cost millions of dollars and fed gossip columns for months. For more than a decade, words hardly did him justice. Franz Beckenbauer, once West Germany's greatest player and coach of the 1990 world championship team: \"Maradona is the great player every team wants to have.\" Guy Thys, the Belgium team coach after the 1986 World Cup: \"If Maradona was in my team, Belgium would have been in the final.\" Arrigo Sacchi, the coach of A.C. Milan of the Italian league: \"Maradona was even greater than Pele.\" But in more recent years, the accolades became mixed with criticism, as Maradona, never a stranger to controversy, found himself its constant companion. Eccentricities and More At first, they were merely impish episodes of a rich eccentric: missed practices here and there, unauthorized extensions of a summer or winter vacation, or arguments with coaches. But more recently, his off-the-field involvements took on more somber and serious tones. Four months ago, he shocked both his Naples teammates and his adoring fans when he inexplicably refused to travel to Moscow for Naples's match against Spartak Moscow in the European Champion's Cup tournament, the continent's most prestigious club competition. Maradona eventually changed his mind and arrived in time for the match, but Naples lost on penalty kicks and was eliminated from the tournament. After another unexcused absence by Maradona in Italy two weeks later, the club owner, Corrado Ferlaino, filed a breach of contract suit against the player, asking for damages of up to $5 million. Feeling the Pressure In his defense, Maradona said that he had asked Ferlaino to release him from his contract, which expires in 1993, more than two years ago. \"I just can't take the pressure of playing in Italy anymore,\" Maradona confessed in a television interview in December. \"The pressure of games, of practices, and of the newspapers, always talking about Maradona. It's not that I don't want to accept the responsibility. I can't. I can't be the person or the player I was.\" Worse was to come. On Feb. 13, the Italian weekly magazine Epoca reported that Maradona's name had come up during an investigation of drug trafficking and prostitution in Naples. Two days later, at his own request, Maradona was interrogated for three hours by the officials conducting the investigation. Maradona, who has two daughters, admitted to having solicited the services of prostitutes but denied having used cocaine. Staying in Villa One week after his testimony, he was informed by a Naples district attorney that he was under investigation for the possession and distribution of cocaine. \"I knew something like this would happen when I announced that I wanted to leave Naples,\" he said on the steps of the courthouse after his testimony. \"My lawyers will handle it.\""

But economists and business executives here say the cocaine trade is actually retarding Colombian economic growth. A big problem is that the drug profits are repatriated as contraband goods. Colombia's two largest cities, Bogota and Medellin, have large shopping centers, both called San Andresito after Colombia's San Andres Island in the Caribbean. Most contraband passes from the island to these bulging inland malls. Contraband sales are estimated at $1 billion a year."

Looking into the agency's operations in the country that produces much of the cocaine that reaches the United States and where he has been told he could see the war against drugs at its most effective, Mr. Jennings finds unredeemed failure."

A fellow former officer, Kenneth Eurell, was named as an unindicted co-conspirator, strongly indicating that he would turn against Mr. Dowd and be a star witness at any trial and presumably before a mayoral commission that is starting an investigation into allegations of police corruption in the city. Details on Diaz Group The Federal indictment, announced yesterday by Otto G. Obermaier, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, provided details on how police officers in the 75th Precinct in Brooklyn helped reputed Dominican drug dealers in what Mr. Obermaier called the Diaz Organization, or La Compania, sell more cocaine by choosing locations that they knew would not be raided by the police. According to Federal authorities, the gang's operations stretched from northern Manhattan to the Long Island suburbs."

At least one of the officers and perhaps others in the group also used cocaine, Deputy Chief Robert J. Beatty said. Two of the officers' wives were accused of helping in the cocaine business and a sixth active-duty officer was charged with conspiring to sell anabolic steroids, which are used by athletes to increase power and speed. Bought Drugs in Bodegas The arrests, made by Suffolk County police officers, represent the most flagrant charge of drug corruption in the city's police force in six years. For at least a year, the officers, sometimes in uniform and sometimes also working out of their patrol cars, bought drugs in bodegas in the 73d Precinct in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville section and the 94th Precinct in the Greenpoint section and took them back to Long Island, where they lived, selling out of their homes or meeting dealers and distributors throughout Suffolk County, law-enforcement officials in New York City and Long Island said. The authorities said the accused officers referred Long Island drug dealers to their sources in Brooklyn and financed a mid-level dealer in the city who shared profits with them."

Two civilian witnesses saw it differently, saying that some of the officers beat and kicked Federico Pereira as he lay on the ground face down and \"hogtied\" -- his hands cuffed behind his back with his feet attached. One officer had sat on his back and pulled him up by the neck, chest or chin. Armed with these accounts and a medical examiner's finding that Mr. Pereira, a cocaine addict with past theft and drug convictions, had died of \"traumatic asphyxia,\" a grand jury indicted the five officers for murder, accusing one of fatally choking him and the others of \"acting in concert.\""

Powder and crack are identical chemically, yet the law treats crack as though it were up to 100 times as dangerous. Is the law right? Congress is just beginning to ask why, under Federal laws initially designed to reduce sentencing disparities, such an extreme gap in penalties exists. Congress is also starting to address the ugly consequence of the disparity, including the fact that African-Americans, the majority of crack smokers, are getting the long sentences and whites, mostly powder snorters, the shorter."

When cocaine is sprayed on tomato plants, it freaks out the tomato hornworms. They become hyperactive and develop tremors. At higher concentrations than occur naturally in the coca leaves, cocaine kills the worms. An analogue of cocaine might make a safe pesticide, according to scientists. In the meantime, could confiscated cocaine be dumped on spots like golf courses (see below), where other pesticides are problematic? If so, golfers should follow Bill Clinton's youthful example. Don't inhale."

With his head bowed and his hands clasped behind his back during the hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. DiLorenzo explained how drug dealers paid him thousands of dollars in exchange for \"protection\" from other police officers from the 30th Precinct in northwest Harlem. The drug dealers were not so worried about the prospect of being arrested, Mr. DiLorenzo told Judge Allen G. Schwartz, adding, \"Their main concern was the other officers would rip them off.\""

That unjust disparity remains in force despite a recommendation from the United States Sentencing Commission that it be abandoned. A demagogic Congress passed legislation maintaining the disparity and last week a timid President Clinton signed it into law. Crack, the cheaper, smokable form of cocaine is chemically nearly identical to the powder form, usually snorted. But selling five grams of crack brings a mandatory five-year minimum sentence while it takes a sale of 500 grams of powder to bring the same penalty. Crack is the only drug for which the penalty for simple possession is a mandatory five years. Possession of powder carries a one-year maximum and is often punished simply by probation and treatment."

In what officials described as the most precipitous shift in almost six years, the wholesale price of cocaine has increased nearly 50 percent since May, while retail prices have gone up 30 to 60 percent or more. Similar increases, they said, are evident in other big Eastern cities dependent on New York-based Cali operatives for supplies."

Most notable was the capture of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, one of the cartel's most powerful figures. His younger brother, Jorge Eliecer Rodriguez Orejuela, was arrested in March. At about the same time, President Clinton gave Colombia a failing grade on its efforts to stop the drug trade. Since then Bogota has been trying harder, with the help of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration, to crack down on the drug lords. But it is still too early to declare victory. In March Mr. Clinton sensibly waived the sanctions that usually accompany a negative assessment on drug interdiction, maintaining it would serve Washington's interests better to continue helping Colombia fight its drug lords. They are, after all, serving a seemingly endless demand from North America. The cooperative approach has produced some victories."

Of the 22 people indicted yesterday, 17 were taken into custody in morning raids.

Crack is cheaper and more widely available in the big cities than powder, but chemically they are nearly identical. Congress created the disparity in punishment in a panic a decade ago and only Congress still has any faith in it. The United States Sentencing Commission now reports that the disparity cannot be justified. Like many who have studied the question, the commission believes that in some broad sense crack is more dangerous than powder because of the way it is consumed and marketed and because of its association with violence and youth gangs. How much more dangerous the commission is not yet sure, but certainly not 100 times."

Their results provide further evidence of the power that cigarettes wield over those addicted to nicotine, and offer hints at how treatments might one day break the smoking habit. The results also provide some of the best physiological evidence yet suggesting that nicotine and cocaine addictions work in similar ways."

The cocaine, which officials estimated had a street value of $50 million, was found in hundreds of plastic-wrapped packages crammed into a 5-ton, 20-foot-long metal cylinder that is normally used to press paper in pulp mills. Officials said the cylinder had been loaded in Colombia, taken by boat to Louisiana, and trucked first to Texas and then to New Jersey. It was seized Wednesday, several hours after it had arrived by trailer at an empty, rented factory in Palisades Park, in Bergen County near the Lincoln Tunnel."

'Heaven dust' they call it...\" Young men and girls got hold of it, first in a spirit of investigation and curiosity, then to find themselves bound fast to the wheels of the chariot. Father James B. Curry, pastor of St. James's Church, was one of the first men in the city to become interested in the evil. From his vantage point just off the Bowery he early saw the hold the habit was getting upon the denizens of the district. When it commenced to reach out toward \"his boys,\" as the Father calls the young men of his parish, he arose to combat it. The matter was taken to the Department of Health and an investigation started. . . . A terrible state of affairs was uncovered. \"Sniff parties\" were found to be as frequent and informal in the Tenderloin and along the Bowery. . . . Dr. Graeme Monroe Hammond, the neurologist, says that it is absolutely impossible to cure the cocaine fiend once the habit has become fixed upon him. \"There is nothing that we can do for the confirmed user of the drug,\" says he. \"The best thing for the cocaine fiend is to let him die.\""

Across the street, two white boys waited outside a gate nervously jiggling their pockets. At a service station, a young white woman darted from her car to speak to a man on the corner. The exchanges -- money for drugs -- were quick and not particularly subtle."

Sgt. Dominic Cannizzaro and Officer Joseph Greco, of the 105th Precinct's anti-crime unit, said they were sitting in an unmarked police car in Queens when they saw the driver, Gary Smith, turn his 1994 Toyota Land Cruiser onto 133d Avenue from Francis Lewis Boulevard without signaling. In the back window was a temporary license plate; such plates, the officers said, are often forged."

A mandatory minimum sentence of five years applies equally to possessing 5 grams of crack or 500 grams of powder. One result: longer sentences for black dealers and users, who tend to use the cheaper crack, than for whites, who prefer the powder. Now Attorney General Janet Reno and the White House's director of national drug policy, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, say the 100-to-1 disparity is excessive and outdated; the crack epidemic has stabilized and the violence associated with it has dropped. In a letter released last week, they recommended reducing it to 10-to-1."

The couple were shot execution style in an auto parts store in Rome, N.Y."

The proposal, called the Multinational Counternarcotics Center, is one of several efforts to broaden the role of Latin American militaries in fighting drugs. It is dismaying to see Congress and the Clinton Administration return to a strategy that has failed and could harm Latin democracies. Washington is seeking to keep more than 2,000 soldiers in Panama for 12 years to continue coordinating radar searches for suspicious aircraft, a job that could be done from American soil. The troops would also train Latin American military and police forces in drug-fighting. The project needs the approval of Panama's Congress and its voters in a referendum. Some American officials say the proposal is a way for Washington to maintain ties and coordination with Latin militaries now that cold-war rationales have evaporated."

But a study released yesterday reports that it is more complicated than that. Not only does cocaine raise the body temperature, researchers wrote in The Annals of Internal Medicine, it also diminishes the body's ability to cool itself down. It even makes it hard for users to tell that they are overheating and, perhaps, take steps to stop it, like seeking a cooler location."

The raid was headed by investigators from the Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Bridget G. Brennan, who heads the prosecutor's office, said the tanker car was parked on a rail spur outside the warehouse. Drug traffickers had siphoned off a quantity of vegetable oil concealing the drugs and cut through the tanker's internal walls to remove the cocaine.

He called the police about 3 a.m. to report a burglary at his apartment on Centre Street in NoLIta. Officers saw no evidence of a burglary, but found cocaine on the computer table, the police said. Prosecutors said that 13 bags of cocaine were recovered, holding a total of one-eighth of an ounce of cocaine. ''Boy George doesn't know where the drugs are from,'' said Louis M. Freeman, Mr. O'Dowd's lawyer, outside the Manhattan courthouse. ''He's a very social person. He has a lot of people over to his apartment.'' He added that his client had called the police ''in good faith,'' believing he had been robbed. ''It's hard to understand why he is being charged with a filing a false report,'' Mr. Freeman said. Mr. O'Dowd was released without having to post bail. He was convicted in England in 1986 for heroin possession. Culture Club broke up in 1987. Jennifer 8. Lee (NYT)"

The condition increases the chance of suffering a heart attack, even years after users stop the drug, researchers in Minnesota are reporting. The risk of developing an aneurysm was four times as high among cocaine users in their mid-40's as among nonusers in the same age group, according to the study, reported yesterday in the journal Circulation, which is published by the American Heart Association."

On Dec. 6, the United States Patent and Trademark Office remanded to the examining attorney the application for a federal trademark for the Cocaine energy drink produced by Redux Beverages. Michael Engel, the trademark examining attorney, had tentatively approved the application when he submitted it to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, but changed his mind and asked for a remand for refusal on Oct. 19. The reasons Mr. Engel cited came from a trademark opposition filed on Oct. 10 by five law students at Cleveland State University's College of Law. (Mr. Engel did not respond to messages left on Friday afternoon.)"

A hyperventilating account of the blood-drenched Miami drug culture in the 1970's and 80's, the movie overflows with cops and coroners, snitches and smugglers, reporters and importers. Most resemble refugees from ''Scarface,'' and all talk a mile a minute -- except for the dead bodies, of course."

About four months ago, he added, he stopped drinking alcohol. Mr. Fabrizi's announcement came after The Connecticut Post published an article on June 16 about the contents of an F.B.I. report that was filed earlier this month in federal court in Bridgeport. The report details interviews with a drug suspect, Juan Marrero, who talked to the F.B.I. about Mr. Fabrizi's drug use, the newspaper reported. In 2004, a Democratic Town Committee member asked Mr. Marrero for cocaine because ''Fabrizi was coming over,'' the newspaper reported. The document was quickly sealed by the United States attorney's office, which said it should never have been released."

It was November 2006, and a Coast Guard cutter spotted a strange blur on the ocean 100 miles off Costa Rica. As the cutter approached, what appeared to be three snorkels poking up out of the water became visible. Then something even more surprising was discovered attached to the air pipes: a homemade submarine carrying four men, an AK-47 and three tons of cocaine. Today, the 49-foot-long vessel bakes on concrete blocks outside the office of Rear Adm. Joseph Nimmich in Key West, Fla. Here, at the Joint Interagency Task Force South, Nimmich commands drug-interdiction efforts in the waters south of the United States. Steely-eyed, gray-haired and dressed in a blue jumpsuit, he showed me the homemade sub one hot February afternoon like a hunter flaunting his catch. ''We had rumors and indicators of this for a very long period beforehand,'' he told me, which is why they nicknamed it Bigfoot."

Four months later, the guerrillas arrived, accusing the villagers of helping the military. They abducted the village leader, who has not been seen since."

It reported a broad decline in drug use among young people since 2001. This included a 24 percent drop in the overall use of illicit drugs. There was one exception he said: abuse of painkillers. But, one important metric that wasn't mentioned, and that stubbornly resisted the downturn, was the use of cocaine. According to data from the group that produced the report, the percentage of both black and white 12th graders who confessed to using cocaine in the past 30 days has essentially stayed flat since 2001. The major difference is that white usage outweighs black usage 4 to 1. (If you take a longer view back to 1991, when cocaine usage bottomed out following the outrageous '80s, usage among white 12th graders since then has nearly doubled, while usage among black 12th graders has fallen a bit.)"

Congress moderated, but unfortunately didn't eliminate, that disparity last year by passing the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, reducing the ratio to 18 to 1. For anyone, that is, who committed a crack offense after the law went into effect last August. For those who committed crack-related crimes before then but have yet to be sentenced, it doesn't. They are subject to the old mandatory minimum sentences -- 5 years for 5 grams, 10 years for 50 grams."

The lab was found Wednesday on a remote coffee farm in mountains 100 miles north of Tegucigalpa after a six-month investigation with the assistance of the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, said Oscar Álvarez, the security minister. It was capable of producing about a ton of cocaine a month. Honduras is a growing transshipment point for cocaine from Colombia to the United States but Mr. Álvarez said the laboratory suggested the drug, usually processed in large clandestine laboratories in Colombia, was being refined in Honduras as well. Mr. Álvarez estimated the lab had been operating for the past two or three years. No arrests were made."

China has struggled for years to prevent heroin from entering the country from Myanmar to the south, and sometimes by indirect routes from Pakistan and Afghanistan to the southwest. But experts said that other drugs were becoming a problem as well, although there had been limited evidence until now of large shipments from South America."

I would like to thank Patrick Radden Keefe for disabusing me of this overly simplistic view of drug policy. In his article, Keefe does a masterful job of depicting the complexity of the drug trade, showing the lengths to which the Sinaloa cartel will go to feed demand in the United States. Some form of legalization would allow these drugs to be produced more cheaply and thus cut into the cartels' profits. It would also reduce their ability to hire enforcers, bribe officials and transport their products across borders. A less muscular enemy might then give law-enforcement bodies a fighting chance.

But a jury in Federal District Court in Brooklyn found on Tuesday that his real job was as a drug trafficker. Mr. Rosemond was convicted of running a drug operation that sold millions of dollars' worth of cocaine, often moving it across the country in cases designed for musical equipment, a federal prosecutor said in a statement. Mr. Rosemond, widely known as Jimmy Henchman, was also convicted of financial crimes, obstruction of justice and possessing and using firearms."

		<p><b>Cocaine times</b></p>
		<p>The following image has been constructed with the headlines of NY Times articles dating from 1900 till 2013 that include the word "cocaine". A vertical stripe collects all appearances of the word in a decade. It also includes the next or previous word in the headline. A blank line in between indicates a new year.
		</p>
		<p>This represents just the first attempt at visualizing. Other, maybe more meaningful approaches may follow (or not).</p>

[Tardis]
(The Doctor has regenerated after his ordeal with the Cybermen and energy-draining Mondas. Ben and Polly watched him change into a younger person.)  POLLY: His face, his hair, look at it.  BEN: He's breathing, and the Tardis seems to be normal.  POLLY: Ben, what are we going to do? We can't just leave the Doctor there.  BEN: What, him? The Doctor?  POLLY: Well, that's who came through the doors. There was no one else outside. Ben, do you remember what he said in the tracking room? Something about 'This old body of mine is wearing a bit thin.'  BEN: So he gets himself a new one?  POLLY: Well, yes.  BEN: Oh, do me a favour.  POLLY: Then whatever happened, happened in here.  BEN: But it's impossible.  POLLY: Not so long ago we'd have been saying that about a lot of things.  (The man on the floor moans and opens his eyes. As he struggles to sit up, a searing pain nearly cripples him. Clutching his head, he stares wildly at Ben and Polly, his vision blurred. We hear the thumping of his headache, or is it heartbeat?)  DOCTOR: Stop. Stop. Concentrate on one thing. One thing.  (The man turns his attention to the Tardis console, focusing on the controls. The thumping becomes slower and softer. At last his vision clears. The man removes his hands from his face and looks around him, his features brightening in relief.)  DOCTOR: It's over. (chuckles) It's over.  (The man scrambles to his feet, wobbling unsteadily. Ben and Polly watch but make no attempt to help as he circles the Tardis console as if reacquainting himself with the controls. His clothes hang off his slight frame, much too big, and he struggles to unfasten the heavy cloak that threatens to trip him up. As he does so, an ornate ring drops to the floor.)  BEN: Doctor?  (As the Tardis engine springs to life and dematerialises, the man raises his hands to his face once more, feeling his features as if they belonged to a stranger. Polly moves to pick up the fallen ring, eyeing the newcomer with open curiosity and a little unease. The little man makes his way over to a storage chest, his stiff-legged gait reminding Polly of a small child learning to walk. He trips, but recovers quickly.)  DOCTOR: The muscles are still a bit tight.  BEN: What are we going to do?  POLLY: It is the Doctor. I know it is. I think.  BEN: It's not only his face that's changed. He doesn't even act like him.  (The stranger is rummaging through the contents of the chest.)  BEN: Come on, it's time we sorted this out. Now look here!  DOCTOR: Hold that.  (He hands Ben a mirror.)  DOCTOR: Tilt it.  (The man gazes intently at his reflection. The face in the mirror has a mop of black hair and dark green eyes. Momentarily the image blurs and changes to that of an older, white-haired man before changing back again. Apparently satisfied, the man turns his attention back to the storage chest.)  BEN: Have you done with this?  DOCTOR: Put it down. Put it down.  BEN: Now what's the game?  (The man turns, cheerfully brandishing an ornamental dagger.)  DOCTOR: Ah! The Crusades, from Saladin. The Doctor was a great collector, wasn't he?  POLLY: But you're the Doctor.  DOCTOR: Oh, I don't look like him.  BEN: Who are we?  DOCTOR: Don't you know?  (The man rummages further and pulls out a piece of dull silver metal. His look of mischief fades as the object triggers a very clear memory.)  DOCTOR: Extermination.  (The man stuffs the metal into his pocket. His concern turns to delight as he unearths a magnifying glass. He begins a careful study of his hands.)  DOCTOR: Ah. Very good. Nails need growing.  (Ben takes the Doctor's ring from Polly.)  BEN: Now look, the Doctor always wore this. So if you're him, it should fit now, shouldn't it?  (And slips it on the man's finger. It's far too big.)  BEN: There. That settles it.  DOCTOR: I'd like to see a butterfly fit into a chrysalis case after it's spread its wings.  POLLY: Then you did change!  DOCTOR: Life depends on change and renewal.  BEN: Oh, so that's it. You've been renewed, have you?  DOCTOR: I've been renewed, have I? That's it. I've been renewed. It's part of the Tardis. Without it, I couldn't survive. Come here.  (Unexpectedly, the man rounds on Polly.)  DOCTOR: Come here.  (Still rather nervous of this strange interloper, Polly steps closer.)  DOCTOR: The Doctor kept a diary, didn't he?  POLLY: Yes.  DOCTOR: I thought so. I wonder where. I wonder where.  (Ben and Polly watch as the man resumes his search of the chest.)  POLLY: He's a very different Doctor, Ben.  BEN: Yeah, maybe. Just where do we stand, though?  (The man has found something else in the chest. A descant recorder. He removes it with great care and stands flexing his fingers over the holes. His expression is one of pure child-like joy, and convinces Polly that it's time for her to trust her instincts about the man's identity. He plays a little tune and dances a jig, stopping when he spots the missing diary.)  POLLY: Doctor?  (Tucking the recorder into his jacket, the Doctor begins to read.)  POLLY: Doctor, what's going to happen to us?  DOCTOR: I think. I think we must have landed for sometime. I think it's time we went for a stroll.  (The Doctor grabs a stove-pipe hat from the chest. Engrossed in his reading, he moves to the console and opens the Tardis doors.)  POLLY: But you don't know where we've landed!  BEN: No, you haven't checked the oxygen or the temperature or anything!  DOCTOR: (still reading the diary) Oxygen density 172, radiation nil, temperature 86. Strong suggestion of mercury deposits. Satisfied, Ben? Now, are you two coming or are you not?  POLLY: He does know us. He said Ben. Didn't you hear him?  BEN: Yeah, I heard. But he might just have been copying you though, mightn't he?
[Mercury swamp]
(The Tardis has landed in a misty swamp. The ground is rocky and pitted with small bubbling pools which occasionally spray a fine silver mist into the air. The Doctor wanders away, still fascinated by the contents of the diary. Strolling directly towards a small pool of mercury, he is apparently oblivious to any danger, yet manages to successfully circumnavigate the obstacle without once looking up from his reading. Suddenly realising what he's done, he stops and looks back, delighted at having outwitted the obstruction and laughs. But then he looks down and sloshes out of the watery puddle in which he is now standing.)  DOCTOR: Are you coming, you two?  (The Doctor continues on his way. After a short distance he stops once more. A boulder blocks his path. Pulling a tape measure from his pocket, he takes some extensive measurements of the rock, and scribbles some calculations on an empty page of the diary. The Doctor glances round him. The boulder stands in a clearing and he could easily walk round it, but a look of mischief crosses his face. Backing up a few steps, the Doctor looks down at his legs, flexing his knees.)  DOCTOR: Time I put you through some tests, I think.  (Breaking into a run, the Doctor successfully leap-frogs the boulder.)  EXAMINER: Hello?  (A newcomer has entered the clearing.)  EXAMINER: Hello? Is there anyone there? Hello? Hello? Why don't they come? (sees the Doctor) Ah, so you've come at last. I'm from Earth. I'm the Examiner.  (There's a gun shot. The man crumples to the ground. Horrified, the Doctor's about to dive for cover then pauses and, keeping low, approaches the fallen figure. He rolls the man over, and sees that he is dead. Searching for some kind of identification, the Doctor finds a large round badge. Automatically reaching into his top pocket he pulls out a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and puts them on. He squints at the badge and moves it backwards and forwards, trying to focus on it, yet all he can see is a misty blur. He removes the spectacles and tries again. This time the text is clear.)  DOCTOR: Earth Examiner. Accord every access. Vulcan.  (Behind the Doctor, a figure looms out of the mist, wearing an all-concealing white suit and goggles. The figure trains a pistol on the Doctor's back.)  BEN: Doctor, where are you?  (The Doctor turns. The figure dodges out of sight. Close to the Tardis, Ben and Polly are exploring the swamp.)  BEN: Phwoar, ain't it hot.  POLLY: Do you think the air's like this everywhere?  BEN: Nah, might be just around here. Don't want too many lungfuls of it, I know that. Here, when I was a kid, we used to live opposite a brewery. You could take a walk and get tipsy all in one go.  POLLY: It's beautiful.  BEN: No, don't touch it, Polly.  POLLY: I wasn't going to.  BEN: No, it's quicksilver. It gets through the pores. Where is the Doctor, or whatever he is, got to?  (As Ben moves away, a cloud of mercury vapour catches Polly full in the face. She coughs.)  BEN: What's the matter? Hey, Polly! Hey, Doctor, wherever you are. Quick, there's something happening to Polly!  (The Doctor heads back to the Tardis at a run.)  BEN: Quick! Over this way!  (Pistol raised as a bludgeon, the suited figure steps out behind the Doctor and knocks him down. The Doctor grabs at the figure briefly before sinking to the ground, unconscious. Working quickly, the stranger presses something into the Doctor's palm then drags the Examiner's body away. The Doctor is left sprawled on the ground, a button clutched in his outstretched hand.)  (Meanwhile, Ben is trying to drag the unconscious Polly to safety. Another cloud of mercury vapour rises from the pool.)  BEN: Doctor!  (The last thing Ben sees before he passes out, is a white suited figure holding a pistol approaching fast.)  (Some time later, a young man in a white survival suit, goggles pushed up over his head, is kneeling besides the seemingly unconscious Doctor. Another older man, similarly attired, approaches.)  BRAGEN: Ah, Quinn, there you are. What have you got there? My people have found two more of them by one of the pools.  QUINN: This one's got a nasty bruise on the back of his head. Fallen over his feet and knocked himself out, I suppose.  BRAGEN: I suppose so.  QUINN: Why don't they use the kit we send them?  BRAGEN: Yes. The other two have had a rather bad dose of fumes. The girl has, anyway.  QUINN: Girl?  BRAGEN: Yes, but she'll recover.  (Ben and Polly are helped into the clearing by two guards.)  QUINN: These comic opera guards of yours do have some uses after all.  BRAGEN: I pick them for their physical fitness.  QUINN: I thought it wasn't for their IQ. Give me a hand with the Examiner, will you.  BRAGEN: I wonder why Earth has chosen to send an Examiner to Vulcan? Just now, I mean.  QUINN: I don't know.  BRAGEN: It's a mystery, isn't it? He isn't due for another two years.  (Ben is recovering.)  QUINN: How do you feel?  BEN: (cough) Urgh.  QUINN: We saw your rocket overshoot the landing area.  BEN: Ay?  QUINN: Don't worry. Most of the ships from Earth do over-shoot. I'm Quinn, Deputy Governor.  BRAGEN: Bragen, Head of Security.  QUINN: Let's get them all back, shall we? I'll take the girl.  BRAGEN: Here, you two, help carry the Examiner.  (The guards lift the Doctor between them.)  BRAGEN: I suppose you Earth people can't wait to examine Lesterson's space capsule?  BEN: Ay?  (Ben is startled as the Doctor winks slyly at him.)
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Lesterson is polishing an oddly shaped piece of metal. A huge space capsule dominates one side of the room. Lesterson's assistant, Janley, joins him.)  JANLEY: (a woman) Lesterson.  LESTERSON: Look at this.  JANLEY: They've just brought in an Examiner from Earth, and a couple of assistants.  LESTERSON: An Examiner? What's he here for?  JANLEY: I thought you'd know.  LESTERSON: It's the capsule, it must be. Well, they can't stop me working on it, I'll tell you that.  JANLEY: Could anyone?  LESTERSON: The Governor's always been difficult about it. But surely they wouldn't send somebody all the way from Earth just  JANLEY: Look, what about the meeting?  LESTERSON: Meeting?  JANLEY: Yes. I've arranged everything. Can we still use the old rocket room?  LESTERSON: Yes, I suppose so. But I do wish you wouldn't get mixed up with these pressure groups, Janley.  JANLEY: Well, somebody has to do something. The colony's running down and you know it.  LESTERSON: I'm too busy.  JANLEY: But if we ran things, you'd have better facilities, more money. I wish you'd take an interest.  LESTERSON: Now look, I don't mind letting you have the use of one of my rooms now and again, Janley, but don't try to involve me. This is what I find important. Two hundred years in a mercury swamp and this piece of metal that dropped from it? Look, a couple of minutes polishing and it's as good as new.  JANLEY: Wonderful.  LESTERSON: Rain, damp, heat, mercury. Nothing touches this metal. No corrosion, Janley. Think of that.  JANLEY: Well, I hope the Examiner lets you go on with your experiment. Frankly, I doubt it. I think the Governor's brought the Examiner here to stop you opening the capsule. You should join our group, Lesterson. You might need us one day.
[Guest quarters]
(Fully recovered, the Doctor, Ben and Polly have been left to make themselves comfortable. The Doctor is plays on his recorder.)  BEN: So the murdered man was the real Examiner?  (Nodding, the Doctor blows a pair of notes.)  BEN: Well, did you see who did it?  (Top note screech.)  POLLY: The Doctor got this button though.  BEN: I think it's pretty dull around here. I don't know why we don't just go back to the Tardis.  POLLY: Doctor, are you going to let them think you're the real Examiner?  (Two notes repeated.)  POLLY: Won't that be dangerous?  (Two notes again.)  BEN: Look, why don't you stop blowing that thing and talk to us properly?  POLLY: Ben!  BEN: Now don't you start. It's bad enough with him.  POLLY: Well, he hasn't done anything.  BEN: No, that's just the trouble.  (Ben snatches the recorder away.)  BEN: He knows what happened back at the Tardis, yet will he tell us? Will he come out and say? Will he admit to being the Doctor?  (Ben blows angrily into the recorder. There is a knock on the door.)  BEN: Come in!  (Two guards in peaked caps and dark uniforms enter, with Bragen and a large bearded man in his late fifties.)  HENSELL: I am Hensell, the Governor. I trust you're all feeling much better?  BEN: I've felt worse, Governor. The Governor.  HENSELL: If Earth had seen fit to warn us you were coming, we might possibly have been able to guide you down to the landing area.  DOCTOR: If Earth didn't warn you we were coming, Governor, they must have had a very good reason. I wonder what it was?  HENSELL: Now look here, I run this Colony. I'm entitled to know why you have come to Vulcan. What is your brief?  DOCTOR: I am the Examiner.  HENSELL: Why are you here?  DOCTOR: To examine. And I intend to start my examination at once.  (The Doctor darts forward and begins to examine Bragen's tunic.)  HENSELL: Someone's leaked reports about these Rebel groups. That's it, isn't it?  DOCTOR: Your turn now, Governor.  (The Doctor turns his attention to Hensell's clothing.)  BRAGEN: There is Lesterson's capsule.  HENSELL: Internal affairs are my business, Bragen. Please don't interfere.  DOCTOR: Please go on.  HENSELL: The capsule. It was found in a mercury swamp. It must have been here for centuries.  DOCTOR: Interesting. Continue.  HENSELL: For centuries before the Earth colony arrived. I felt it might be dangerous. It might contain bacteria.  DOCTOR: I shall examine the capsule later. You may leave us.  HENSELL: I shall look forward to your report. Bragen, see that the Examiner and his party get some proper clothes, will you?  (Hensell, Bragen, and the guards leave.)  DOCTOR: We are wearing proper clothes.  (The Doctor starts playing again.)  BEN: Oh, how did he get that thing back again. That was a bit of a cheek, wasn't it, seeing if the Governor was the guy you got the button off?  POLLY: Doctor? When he was talking to you, you were staring at the other man.  DOCTOR: Yes, very rude of me, wasn't it. Terrible manners. To tell you the truth, I was studying his reaction, seeing if he agreed with the story.  BEN: Did he?  DOCTOR: Must have a look at that capsule.  BEN: Now, you want to watch you don't take this Examiner stuff a bit too far.  DOCTOR: Our answers must come from that mercury swamp.  BEN: 'Cause at least one bloke ain't going to be fooled.  DOCTOR: When Bragen found us, he definitely said space capsule.  BEN: Look, you're not going to fool the guy that did the real Examiner in!
[Corridor]
(A little later Bragen, accompanied by a guard, is posting a notice on a board. Quinn approaches.)  QUINN: Bragen! What's all this nonsense about having to have a pass to see the Examiner?  BRAGEN: It's the Governor's idea.  QUINN: Surely it doesn't apply to me?  BRAGEN: It's not my order, Quinn. I expect the Governor wants to keep people away from him.  QUINN: It sounded like one of your red-tape ideas.  BRAGEN: It had nothing to do with me.  QUINN: Right!  (Quinn strides away, practically colliding with Janley.)  JANLEY: Oh!  QUINN: Sorry, Janley.  JANLEY: My fault.  QUINN: Are you all right?  JANLEY: Yes. Lesterson's just cleared me out of his lab. Is the Examiner going to let him open the capsule?  QUINN: I don't know. I'm on my way there now, if I can push past Bragen's army of lay-abouts.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Later that evening, the Doctor takes Ben and Polly to see the space capsule. The Doctor spots the piece of metal that Lesterson was polishing earlier. He picks it up and examines it, worriedly.)  DOCTOR: Where did you get this?  LESTERSON: It dropped from the capsule.  DOCTOR: Dropped?  LESTERSON: Yes, when it was being hauled into the laboratory. But, you can see, this metal could revolutionise space travel. That's why I'm insisting that we open it. Well, who knows what other marvels there may be inside?  HENSELL: But Lesterson, I didn't think you could open it.  LESTERSON: Well, I have a theory. I'm convinced that the opening mechanism on the other side is either here, or here.  (While Lesterson is occupied, the Doctor pulls out the piece of metal he found in the Tardis and compares the two. They are identical.)  DOCTOR: Extermination.  LESTERSON: Now, my theory is that I can insert a laser ray in this ridge here. The ray spreads, fuses the opening device and gets us in.  HENSELL: Examiner, I shall have to make it your responsibility.  DOCTOR: A laser. Why not? It shouldn't be too difficult.  (The laser fires at the first spot. Nothing happens.)  LESTERSON: Well, we'll try the other side.  (Lesterson refocuses the laser. A mechanism engages and the hatchway slides open. The Doctor and Lesterson step into the capsule.
[Capsule entry]
(A small brightly lit chamber. The Doctor studies the far wall. Everyone else crowds in.)  LESTERSON: Hmm. It's a bit disappointing.  DOCTOR: Not really. This is just an entry bay, isn't it.  LESTERSON: Yes, I suppose so.  HENSELL: Well, this doesn't get us very far, does it?  LESTERSON: Getting into the rest of the capsule will take time, Governor.  BEN: Well, can't you use that torch thing again? That must be an opening door.  LESTERSON: I should have to measure it up and find out where the lock mechanism is.  DOCTOR: I think we'll leave if for tonight.  HENSELL: Leave it for tonight? But what did we come here for?  DOCTOR: That is my decision, Governor.  HENSELL: But good heavens above, man.  DOCTOR: A hundred years you say this has been buried?  LESTERSON: Oh, at least. Now, there must be something in the inner compartment. We shall be able to find out where it came from originally.  DOCTOR: It didn't come from this planet Vulcan.  LESTERSON: Oh no, no, no. The metal is quite alien.  DOCTOR: Alien, yes. Very alien. Goodnight.  (The Doctor leaves the laboratory.)  BEN: What's he up to now?  POLLY: Ben, we're not going to let him out of our sight.  (Ben and Polly follow the Doctor from the lab.)
[Lesterson's laboratory]
HENSELL: Well, Lesterson, you got your way. Was it worth sending for this Examiner? This idiotic Examiner?  LESTERSON: I didn't send for him. I thought you did.  QUINN: Why don't you let me talk to the Examiner, Hensell. I can find out what's he's here for.  HENSELL: No, no, no, no. You keep away from him. We'll leave him to work with Lesterson here. We've all got enough to do without having to worry about some amateur critic from Earth interfering.  QUINN: But with five minutes  HENSELL: You heard what I said, Quinn. You won't mind keeping the Examiner busy, Lesterson? I don't mind what you do with him so long as you keep his nose out of our business.  LESTERSON: Yes. All right.  HENSELL: All right. Well, we shall talk about it tomorrow.  (Once he's alone, Lesterson returns to his workbench where he quickly realises that his metal sample has disappeared.)
[Guest quarters]
(Later that night.)  POLLY: Ben!  BEN: (waking) What?  POLLY: Shh! He's in the corridor.  BEN: Who is?  POLLY: The Doctor, you clod. Come on, quick!
[Corridor]
POLLY: He's going towards Lesterson's lab.  BEN: Of course. To the space capsule.  POLLY: Come on.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(The Doctor steps into the deserted laboratory, which is eerily illuminated by the light glowing from the interior of the capsule. At the capsule entrance, he dips into his pockets and takes out the two pieces of metal. Ben and Polly appear in the doorway of the lab just in time to see the Doctor disappear into the capsule.)
[Capsule entrance]
(The Doctor crosses to the far wall and inserts one of the pieces of metal into a narrow opening. An inner door slides open, revealing a second compartment. The Doctor edges forward, peering into the gloom. Two shapes are silhouetted against the dull metal glow. Familiar, giant pepperpot shapes.)  DOCTOR: Polly, Ben, come in and meet the Daleks.  BEN: What?  DOCTOR: The Daleks.  (As Polly approaches, a sucker arm drops.)  POLLY: You could have opened this before.  DOCTOR: These two pieces of metal are identical. The Doctor got one of them from the Daleks himself.  BEN: Why do you keep saying the Doctor if you mean you?  DOCTOR: I knew I should find them here. I knew it.  BEN: Ah, they look harmless. Not very lively.  POLLY: What do you think? Two hundred years in a swamp and you wouldn't look very lively either. Nothing could live through that, could it?  BEN: Live?  DOCTOR: Nothing human, no.  POLLY: Doctor, look.  BEN: What's the matter?  (The Doctor kneels to examine the marks on the dusty floor.)  DOCTOR: There were three Daleks in here! What's happened to the other one?  (Ben catches sight of something moving in the corner behind the Doctor.)  BEN: Doctor!  (Polly screams. The Doctor spins around. A clawed mutant scuttles from the shadows across the floor.)
Episode Two
[Capsule]
DOCTOR: A light. A torch, outside.  BEN: Did you see it?  DOCTOR: Quickly, Ben, quickly!  POLLY: What was it?  (Ben runs out into the laboratory to look for the torch. He soon finds a lamp with a long lead and drags it back into the capsule, unaware that he's being watched by Resno, one of Lesterson's assistants. The Doctor takes the lamp and begins checking every corner of the compartment.)  POLLY: Can you answer me?  BEN: It was a sort of disembodied hand. A sort of claw. It was horrible.  (The Doctor searches for a while but doesn't find anything.)  DOCTOR: No. No, there's nothing.  BEN: You were right. There were three Daleks.  POLLY: Don't you know what it was? If there were three, who moved it?  BEN: Don't ask me. Lesterson?  POLLY: But he hadn't opened the capsule.  BEN: No, he said he hadn't opened it. Lets get our facts straight.  DOCTOR: Ah ha. Excellent! Good thinking, good thinking.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
BEN: Well, does that mean you think he's been inside?  DOCTOR: Perhaps he's been experimenting on the Daleks? Ah.  POLLY: But, but they're things. I, I mean they're dead. They must be!  DOCTOR: This light is dead. Now the watch.  (The Doctor flicks the torch on and off.)  BEN: Do you mean these things just need power?  DOCTOR: Now, Lesterson's fanatic. The Governor's jealous of his own position. What does that suggest to you? Don't know. Haven't thought about it. But all is not well with this colony. Add to that one Dalek.  BEN: Oh, blimey, you don't half make mountains, don't you? One Dalek?  DOCTOR: Yes! All that is needed to wipe out this entire colony.
[Guest quarters]
QUINN: Examiner? Examiner?  (Bragen enters.)  QUINN: Bragen, don't you ever knock before you enter a room?  BRAGEN: I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I was expecting to find the Examiner here, not you, Quinn.  QUINN: Well, he's not here. You'll probably want to start snooping under the bed, so I'll leave you to it.  BRAGEN: One moment.  QUINN: Don't try your luck with me, Bragen.  BRAGEN: On the contrary, I'm trying to avoid trouble. The Governor gave express instructions that you were not to contact the Examiner. I find you here. I'm sure you can offer some suitable explanation.  QUINN: I can. But not to you.  BRAGEN: Before you go. Oh!  (Quinn shoves Bragen to the floor.)  QUINN: Don't ever try to block my way again.  BRAGEN: Guard!  (As Quinn leaves a guard enters and helps Bragen to his feet.)  BRAGEN: The Examiner is missing. He must be found immediately.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(The Doctor is examining the exterior of the capsule.)  BEN: Of course, the real Doctor was always going on about the Daleks.  POLLY: Real Doctor?  DOCTOR: Real Doctor? Oh, you mean the real Doctor.  BEN: Yeah, now I've seen that claw thing, well, wouldn't want to shake hands with it, let's put it that way.  POLLY: Doctor, look, if they're that dangerous, what are you going to do about it?  DOCTOR: Save my breath. Would Lesterson listen? Lesterson listen. Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen. Exercises the tongue. Try it. Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen.  BEN: Look, they think you're the Examiner, order them to destroy the Daleks. Well, chuck your weight about.  POLLY: (in background) Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen.  POLLY + DOCTOR: Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...  (Behind them, Lesterson and Resno enter.)  LESTERSON: What do you think you're doing in here?  DOCTOR: Listen, listen.  (The Doctor holds out the Examiner's badge.)  LESTERSON: Who gave you permission?  DOCTOR: Read this. Aloud!  LESTERSON: Accord every access.  DOCTOR: Exactly! It doesn't say 'except your laboratory' anywhere does it? Unless it's in micro-print.  LESTERSON: I should have been asked first.  DOCTOR: What was the first thing you noticed when you looked inside that capsule?  BEN: Well, the Daleks.  DOCTOR: You were astounded?  POLLY: Yes.  DOCTOR: Amazed?  BEN: Yes.  DOCTOR: You didn't even give them a glance! Why? Because you'd been in there and seen them. Where is the third Dalek?  LESTERSON: I don't know what you're talking about.  DOCTOR: You opened up the capsule without permission. You found the inner compartment containing three Daleks. You took one of them away and you hid it!  LESTERSON: Hid it? What, what nonsense!  BRAGEN: May I ask what all this is about?  POLLY: We opened an inner compartment in the capsule, and Lesterson had already been in there.  LESTERSON: I don't deny that.  BEN: And he's nicked a Dalek!  BRAGEN: Dalek?  LESTERSON: It's the name the Examiner has given to two metal creations that I've discovered inside the capsule.  BEN: And they're dangerous. Evil.  LESTERSON: Lumps of metal. Quite inactive.  BEN: That's what you think, mate. If you'd seen  (The Doctor's recorder silences Ben.)  LESTERSON: I consider it my duty as a scientist to examine and investigate these objects. Now please, all of you, keep out of my laboratory. Keep your hands off my experiments!  DOCTOR: These lumps of metal, Daleks, I want them broken up, or melted down. Up or down, I don't care which, but destroyed!  LESTERSON: I refuse to allow it.  DOCTOR: I'm an Earth Examiner. I demand it.  LESTERSON: You're exceeding your authority.  DOCTOR: Perhaps we should ask the Governor about that? I wish to see him immediately.  BRAGEN: That might be difficult.  DOCTOR: But not impossible. Ben, Polly.  (The Doctor, Ben, and Polly leave, followed by Bragen.)  RESNO: Could he stop the experiments?  LESTERSON: I don't know. It's none of your business. You go and get Janley and then come back here. We haven't got any time to waste. Now go on, man. Quickly, quickly.  (Resno leaves. Lesterson goes to the capsule and opens a hidden compartment, revealing the third Dalek.)  LESTERSON: They won't stop me experimenting. There must be some way to bring you back to life, and I'm going to find it.
[Guest quarters]
BRAGEN: And of course you do have the right of any access.  DOCTOR: Which is why I have a badge which says so.  BRAGEN: Lesterson watches over his ideas like a mother hen.  DOCTOR: If there was a bomb under this floor timed to go off in five minutes, would you ask my permission before you ripped up the floorboards? Ah ha, fruit!  POLLY: Thank you.  BRAGEN: Examiner, it's up to you of course, but I'd advise a little discretion in your investigations. It's not a very good time, just now.  (The Doctor is generously distributing fruit from a bowl by the bedside.)  BRAGEN: Thank you. With all these disturbances  POLLY: Disturbances?  BRAGEN: Yes, minor acts of sabotage. Rebel cliques, secret newspapers, nothing important you understand, but it keeps the Governor busy. I've no doubt he'll tell you about it himself when I arrange your meeting with him.  BEN: When will that be?  BRAGEN: Oh, he's going on a tour of the perimeter of the colony. I'll find out if he can see you before he goes.  POLLY: Thank you.  (Bragen leaves. Polly sits next to Ben on the bed.)  BEN: You know, it's little things like this that make it difficult to believe that you're the Doctor. The other one, I mean. The proper one. Oh, nuts, you know what I mean.  DOCTOR: Nuts? Yes, certainly, here we are. Crackers?  BEN: You, my old china, are an out and out phony!  DOCTOR: China. Yes, I went there once I believe. Met Marco Polo.  BEN: No, not China. China! China and plate, mate, friend.  DOCTOR: Yes, Marco Polo, a friend. I believe he was.  POLLY: Don't listen to him, Doctor. I know who you are.  DOCTOR: Shh!  (The Doctor gestures Polly into silence as he listens closely to a piece of fruit he's chosen from the bowl. Gently placing the fruit on the table, he pulls a pen knife from his pocket and carefully slices the fruit in half.)  POLLY: It's a  (Concealed in the middle of the fruit is a tiny listening device. Indicating that Ben and Polly should remain silent, the Doctor extracts the device, drops it to the floor and stamps down hard, crushing it.)  BEN: Well, well, a touch of the bugs. Microphones.  POLLY: Someone's been listening to what we were saying!  BEN: Yes, so that's why you were messing about and talking nonsense.  DOCTOR: I never talk nonsense.  POLLY: Ahem.  DOCTOR: Well, hardly never.  BEN: Well, they certainly believe in making us at home, don't they?  DOCTOR: At first, I thought there might be more than one.  BEN: Here, I bet old Charlie Bragen did it.  POLLY: Charlie?  BEN: Well Fred wouldn't suit him, would it.  POLLY: If he did do it, do you think it was his own idea? I mean, he could have been under orders.  BEN: You mean from the Governor? Ah, I don't know. What do you think, Doctor?  DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes of course. Let's consider this button for a moment. It's the only clue we've got to the murderer of the Examiner. The real Examiner.  POLLY: And who asked for him to come?  BEN: Well, Lesterson's crackers about that capsule. He wouldn't want anyone nosing about.  POLLY: Bragen said the Governor's been having trouble.  BEN: No, rule him out. Governors are all the same. He wouldn't ask for help. If he sent the word it would look as if he couldn't do the job properly.  POLLY: Yes.  BEN: Oh, well, I vote we go back to the Tardis. I've had enough of this dump.  DOCTOR: Have you? What about the Daleks?  BEN: Well, they're dead.  POLLY: Well, what about that thing we saw in the capsule? That was alive all right.  BEN: Yeah, I can't explain that.  DOCTOR: I can. And that's why we have to stay.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
RESNO: Ugly-looking brutes, aren't they?  (Janley and Resno are wiring up the Dalek for testing.)  RESNO: What's he want to muck about with them for? Leave well alone, that's what I say.  JANLEY: You're a fine one to be a research assistant. Leave well alone. There'll be no progress on this planet with people like you around.  RESNO: We're doing all right as we are. Or we were until your lot came along stirring things up. You won't get away with it, you know. The Governor knows all about you rebels. He'll smash the lot of you when he's ready.  JANLEY: Governor?  RESNO: Yeah, the Governor!  JANLEY: He couldn't smash  LESTERSON: Will you be quiet! Where do you both think you are? This is a scientific laboratory. Kindly keep your politics out of it. Come on, Resno, man, get on with it. We haven't got all day. We've got to get this working before the Examiner stops us. He's got some phobia about these, these Daleks.
[Guest quarters]
(The Doctor is sitting on the bed clutching his diary.)  DOCTOR: I know the misery they cause, the destruction. But there's something else more terrible. Something I can only half remember.  POLLY: Doctor, what was it?  (A knock at the door. Bragen enters.)  DOCTOR: Well? Where is the Governor? What did he say?  BRAGEN: He sends his apologies, Examiner. He can't see you tonight, but he hopes to see you first thing in the morning.  BEN: Well, it might not wait that long, Char, ah, Bragen.  BRAGEN: It will have to.  DOCTOR: Excuse me.  BEN: Where are you going?  DOCTOR: To see the Governor, of course.  BRAGEN: I'm afraid that's not possible. Once his door is closed, no one, not even you, Examiner, is allowed into his room.  DOCTOR: Very well.  BRAGEN: Thank you. Until the morning then.  (Bragen leaves.)  BEN: What happens now?  DOCTOR: I shall radio Earth. Governor or not, Hensell will have to listen to them. I'll get Earth to back me.  (Suddenly the Doctor yanks open the door. The corridor is empty.)  DOCTOR: That's funny. I could have sworn. You stay here. I shan't be long.  (As he leaves, Ben and Polly see the Doctor slip the door knob into his pocket. They laugh.)
[Lesterson's laboratory]
LESTERSON: Connecting now.  RESNO: All connections responding.  LESTERSON: Nothing at all?  RESNO: No.  LESTERSON: Are you sure?  RESNO: There's nothing wrong here.  LESTERSON: Well, let's see.  RESNO: Really, if you can't trust me to read a dial.  LESTERSON: Be quiet. All right, we'll try again. This time we'll take it up to 3.24. Got that, Janley?  JANLEY: 3.24.  (Very slowly, the Dalek's sucker arm begins to rise.)  RESNO: It's moving.  LESTERSON: Now, note this, Janley. Number one attachment with sucker stick responding. Number two attachment not moving. Number three attachment with lens responding. Watch these meters, Resno.  RESNO: Still responding.  LESTERSON: Now, it's reasonable to assume that this the sucker stick acts like some kind of a hand.  (Janley screams.)  LESTERSON: It's all right. Don't be alarmed. We've only introduced temporary power. We shall have to be able to open it up before we could find how it works permanently.  JANLEY: It's a bit frightening.  LESTERSON: Yes. Now, I cannot think what this short stubby arm is for.  JANLEY: Could the lens attachment be an eye?  LESTERSON: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Now it's quite possible that this, Dalek, now there must be some kind of directing influence. There may even be a simplified brain. Positronic, I shouldn't wonder. Oh, if only we could open it up.  (The sucker arm drops suddenly.)  LESTERSON: Now what?  RESNO: Everything functioning here.  LESTERSON: Yes. Well, perhaps the power is leaking away somewhere. We'll try again.  (Janley increases the power supply to the Dalek. The Dale's eye-stick rises slowly.)  RESNO: Look at the eye-stick! It's watching us!  LESTERSON: Don't be absurd.  RESNO: It was, I tell you. I saw it.  LESTERSON: You can't use the phrase 'watching us'. You'll have us believing that the thing has intelligence next. Now, get on with your work, man.
[Communications room]
(The Doctor finds the door ajar and the room in semi-darkness. The place is a mess. The equipment has been sabotaged and the control panel smashed. The body of the radio operator lies on the floor, unconscious. The Doctor checks he is alive and hears movement across the room.)  DOCTOR: I know you're there.  (Quinn steps from the shadows.)  QUINN: Examiner, thank goodness it's you. I've been trying to talk to you ever since you got here.  (Bragen enters.)  BRAGEN: What's happening here? You again.  QUINN: What do you want?  DOCTOR: I found the operator unconscious.  QUINN: Yes, so did I. I was just looking at him when I heard someone move. It must have been you.  BRAGEN: And those?  (Quinn is holding a set of wire cutters.)  QUINN: I picked them up. What is all this?  DOCTOR: The cables have been cut.  QUINN: What? This is serious. It's not just our own communications. We're cut off from Earth as well.  BRAGEN: The only people that would want to do that are the rebels.  QUINN: If those muscle boys of yours had any brains, they'd stop things like this.  DOCTOR: Bragen, I was attacked just after I landed. This is a small souvenir I collected.  BRAGEN: This button belongs to you, doesn't it?  QUINN: Well, yes.  BRAGEN: And you say you picked these up? I suggest that you were sabotaging the communications.  QUINN: That's a lie.  BRAGEN: Having first attacked one of the engineers. I'd detain the Governor on evidence like that.  QUINN: I hope you're not thinking of detaining me, Bragen.  BRAGEN: I've no option. I could hardly let you run around loose after this, could I? All right, guards.  QUINN: I warn you, Bragen!  (As the guards close around him, Quinn relaxes.)  QUINN: All right, you win this round, Bragen. We'll see what it looks like in front of the Governor.  BRAGEN: The Governor will want an enquiry. May I ask what you were doing here?
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Resno has set up a camera on a tripod in front of the Dalek.)  LESTERSON: Right. I've redirected power. This time working up to 4.68. Now, Resno, you will have to dodge between the camera and your meters.  RESNO: Ready.  LESTERSON: Connecting now.  RESNO: All connections responding.  LESTERSON: Excellent.  JANLEY: It's working!  LESTERSON: Excellent. Film it, film it now, Resno. And note the readings, Janley.  (The Dalek's eye-stick spins around and fixes on Resno.)  LESTERSON: It seems to be interested in you, Resno. What's the matter with you, man?  RESNO: I tell you it's intelligent. It's watching me, Lesterson, weighing me up. I can sense it.  LESTERSON: Don't be a fool.  RESNO: I don't like it, I tell you. I don't know what these things can do.  LESTERSON: No, and we never shall know, shall we, unless we take film of every reaction. Now get on with your work, man.  (Reluctantly, Resno returns to the camera. Suddenly, the Dalek's gun-stick emits a blast of negative light. Resno crumples to the floor, the camera crashing down on top of him.)  LESTERSON: Resno!  (Lesterson disconnects the power.)  JANLEY: It's all right, he isn't dead.  LESTERSON: What happened?  JANLEY: Knocked out by the shock wave.  LESTERSON: We must get him to the hospital. I'll go and get help.  (Lesterson leaves. Janley kneels by Resno then reaches for a dust sheet and starts to wrap the body.)
[Guest quarters]
(The next morning, the Doctor stands at the window, deep in thought. He starts playing his recorder.)  POLLY: But we've got to defend Quinn.  BEN: Yeah, I know. He's innocent until he's proved guilty. But he is guilty.  POLLY: He's the Deputy Governor.  BEN: So what? I had a headmaster once who got nicked for not paying his bus fare. And then there's the motive. Don't forget the motive.  POLLY: Like what, for instance?  BEN: Well, he's the Deputy Governor, right? Maybe he wants to be Governor.  POLLY: Oh, that's ridiculous.  BEN: Well, the jacket button wasn't. And he was caught red-handed in the Communications room with a pair of pliers. And don't tell me he was plucking his eye-brows either.  POLLY: Look, there are some people you know are all right. You just know by looking at them.  BRAGEN: Good morning. The enquiry is about to begin. I've been sent to escort you.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Lesterson is preparing the Dalek for a demonstration.)  LESTERSON: Hello, Janley.  JANLEY: Is it time?  LESTERSON: Yes, yes, I think so. I feel quite excited.  JANLEY: So you should. It's a wonderful achievement.  LESTERSON: Yes, yes, but the wonderful thing, Janley, is that we don't know the full scope of this experiment. Who knows where we may go from here. Who know what this Dalek may do?  JANLEY: It's harmless now?  LESTERSON: Yes, yes, yes. I've removed. Oh, Resno. Have you been to see him today?  JANLEY: Yes, yes.  LESTERSON: And?  JANLEY: He's had medical attention. He's going to be all right.  LESTERSON: Oh good.  JANLEY: No one must find out about this accident. It might give the Examiner just the excuse they want, and he could stop the whole project.  LESTERSON: Oh yes. Yes, yes, yes, you're right.  JANLEY: Well. Ready?  LESTERSON: Yes. Let's go and surprise them.
[Governor's office]
(The Doctor, Ben and Polly are shown in.)  HENSELL: I am sorry I couldn't see you earlier, Examiner. Please sit down.  (Quinn is escorted in under guard.)  HENSELL: Well, Quinn, I don't like this any more than you do. What have you been up to?  QUINN: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.  HENSELL: Well, what about Bragen's report then? These are facts, Quinn. Now, what have you got to say about it?  QUINN: Does the engineer say I hit him?  BRAGEN: How could he if he was hit from behind?  QUINN: Then its only circumstantial evidence.  BRAGEN: The Examiner was also attacked in the mercury swamp. We have a button from your jacket found in the Examiner's hand.  QUINN: I can't explain that.  BRAGEN: I'm sure you can't.  HENSELL: Examiner. You seem to be in two minds.  BEN: (sotto) Yeah, and two bodies.  HENSELL: You mentioned to Bragen that these machines of Lesterson's. What do you call them?  DOCTOR: I call them what they are, Daleks.  HENSELL: Yes, yes, yes, Daleks. You say they could be a motive for destroying our communications.  DOCTOR: I do.  (Lesterson enters.)  HENSELL: Lesterson, this is a special enquiry. Now please.  LESTERSON: This won't wait. You won't be disappointed.  HENSELL: You heard what I said, Lesterson.  LESTERSON: Governor, I've just completed an experiment which could revolutionise the whole colony. Bear with me.  DOCTOR: Lesterson, what have you done? What have you done?  LESTERSON: I'll show you. Janley, now!  (Lesterson's Dalek glides into the room. It's movement is strangely fascinating, holding everyone transfixed. Everyone except the Doctor who edges backwards, shaking his head in horror. The Dalek stops and looks around at each person in turn. At last it re-focuses on the Doctor. The Doctor backs into a chair.)  BEN: It recognised the Doctor. It recognised him.  POLLY: What's the matter, Doctor? Are you all right?  DOCTOR: The fools. The stupid fools.  BEN: You're scared. What can it do?  DOCTOR: Nothing yet.  LESTERSON: This creation is called, I understand, a Dalek.  BEN: It knew who you were. It sounds ridiculous, but it did.  DOCTOR: It knew who I was.  BEN: The Dalek knows who you are.  LESTERSON: Now, look at it. I have merely given it electrical power, but it is capable of storing it. Moreover, it responds to orders. Turn around.  (The Dalek obeys.)  LESTERSON: Move that chair.  (The Dalek pushes the chair across the room.)  LESTERSON: Stop. You see? Well, just think what this could do for our mining program, our processing, packaging. Dozens of labour jobs, Governor. It may even supply the end to all this Colony's problems.  DOCTOR: Yes, it will end the colony's problems, because it will end the colony.  DALEK: I am your servant.  LESTERSON: It, it spoke! Janley, did you hear it? It can actually talk.  DOCTOR: It can do many things, Lesterson. But the thing it does most efficiently is exterminate human beings. It destroys them, without mercy, without conscience. It destroys them. Utterly. Completely. It destroys them.  DALEK: (trying to drown out the Doctor) I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant.
Episode Three
[Governor's office]
HENSELL: So, Lesterson, they're even capable of speech.  LESTERSON: Yes. But then, why not? After all, they have a certain intelligence.  HENSELL: Yes, I know, but  LESTERSON: But it is an intelligence that we can control.  HENSELL: So what you want is permission to continue your experiments?  LESTERSON: Governor, think what it would mean if we were to set it to work in the mines. It could double our production overnight.  BRAGEN: Consider the effects it could have on our whole economy.  HENSELL: Yes, and the effect of that on Earth. Yes, yes, they could be very grateful.  DOCTOR: (to Dalek) I shall stop you. I will.  HENSELL: All right, Lesterson, permission granted.  DOCTOR: Permission? Permission for what?  LESTERSON: To continue my work, Examiner.  DOCTOR: But, but didn't you all hear what I said? The Daleks must be destroyed!  LESTERSON: Never!  DOCTOR: Very well. If not by my order, then by Earth's! Come Ben, Polly.  HENSELL: Ah, Examiner, just a moment. Tell me, why are you so against this project?  DOCTOR: But I've told you! I realise I can't give you any proof, but you've no idea of the danger.  LESTERSON: No.  DOCTOR: Yes. Danger! I shall be contacting Earth just as soon as radio communications have been restored.  (The Doctor glares at the Dalek.)  DOCTOR: You're my servant, are you?  DALEK: I am.  DOCTOR: Very well. Immobilise yourself. Go on. I order it! Immediately!  (The Dalek's eye-stalk droops.)  DOCTOR: Huh!  (The Doctor leaves with Ben and Polly. The Dalek comes back to life.)  JANLEY: Lesterson.  LESTERSON: Why did you stop obeying? You were given an order.  DALEK: He has gone.  LESTERSON: Then you obey only  DALEK: His order was wrong. I cannot serve human beings if I am immobilised. You gave me power. Your orders are right. I serve you.  HENSELL: Lesterson. Lesterson, it reasons. Just how limited is its intelligence?  LESTERSON: Now, there is no cause for concern, Governor. Just you wait until you see the amount of work it can do. And now, I'm really going to put you through your paces. Follow me, Dalek.  DALEK: I obey.  (The Dalek follows Lesterson and Janley.)
[Corridor]
DOCTOR: That's it!  POLLY: We should have stayed with Quinn.  BEN: Well, we couldn't have helped him, Polly, even if we'd wanted to. The Governor's already reached his verdict.  DOCTOR: Wire. Scissors. Tape.  POLLY: But he didn't murder the real Examiner. I'm sure he didn't.  BEN: Oh, well. The way I see it this lot's too busy arguing amongst themselves to do much about anything. Anyway, first things first. The Daleks are the important thing.  DOCTOR: Ah! Congratulations, Ben!  BEN: What did I do? What did I do?  DOCTOR: You just used your brains, that's what you did. The Daleks are the most important thing.  POLLY: I still think Quinn's innocent.
[Governor's office]
QUINN: How can I be in league with the rebels?  BRAGEN: The evidence confirms it.  QUINN: It was I that warned of their dangers.  BRAGEN: As part of your overall plan.  QUINN: You wouldn't even take the matter seriously.  BRAGEN: If I was wrong then, I have a chance to rectify it now.  QUINN: If that's going to be your attitude, I suggest that we  HENSELL: Quinn! Let us conduct this inquiry in an orderly manner. Now, the Examiner was attacked. There can be no question of that.  BRAGEN: And the button grabbed by the Examiner was missing from your suit.  HENSELL: Yes, if you've got anything to add to that, you'd better say it now.  QUINN: I didn't attack the man. I had no reason to. I was the one that sent for him.  HENSELL: You sent for him?  QUINN: It was necessary. Under the circumstances, I'd hardly be likely to sabotage the radio communications.  HENSELL: But, but why Quinn? Why?  QUINN: Because of the rebels!  BRAGEN: The rebels. They're nothing more than one or two fanatics.  QUINN: You know as well as I do that they  BRAGEN: Unless you're trying to create trouble here to undermine the Governor's position.  HENSELL: Bragen, you'd better explain that.  BRAGEN: If you're removed, who takes your place? The Deputy Governor, of course. And that's the real reason behind all this trouble, isn't it, Quinn?  HENSELL: Go on.  BRAGEN: You attack the Examiner in the mercury swamp and blame it on the rebels. Then you sabotage the radio and blame that on the rebels too.  HENSELL: Get him out of my sight!  QUINN: Hensell, before you listen to these preposterous allegations  (The guards drag Quinn out.)  HENSELL: I chose Quinn myself. I trained him for the job. Why, in a few years time, he'd have had this seat.  BRAGEN: Sometimes, Governor, a few years is a long time to wait.  HENSELL: Oh, Bragen?  BRAGEN: Governor?  HENSELL: You will assume Quinn's duties. As of now, you are Deputy Governor.
[Guest quarters]
(The Doctor uses a chair to smash the outer casing of a small electrical unit he's appropriated.)  BEN: I hope you know what you're doing.  DOCTOR: So do I. Excellent. excellent.  BEN: I thought we were after the Daleks, not this control unit you've nicked.  DOCTOR: If only we could find a. Ah, yes.  (Crossing to the bed, the Doctor pulls the mattress from the frame.)  BEN: He's a right little delinquent, isn't he?  POLLY: Doctor, what on Earth are you up to?  (The Doctor tugs at one of the metal cross straps on the bed frame until it comes loose.)  DOCTOR: Now we're really getting somewhere!  BEN: Look Doctor, I don't want to appear dim, but how's this going to do the Daleks in?  DOCTOR: They think that Lesterson's the driving force, but I don't. The Daleks are using him.  POLLY: But how?  DOCTOR: Problem. Smash the Daleks, and the people here will lock us up or kill us. Let the Daleks go, and we'll all be exterminated.  BEN: We could just go back to the Tardis. At least we'd be safe to think there.  DOCTOR: Oh yes, it's coming on.  BEN: Oh, you talk to him, will you?  POLLY: Doctor, look, if you told us what you were up to, perhaps we could help you.  DOCTOR: Mustn't underestimate any of them. Lesterson's a first class scientist, first class. He opened the capsule. He realised that the Daleks could be reactivated.  BEN: Yeah, that could be the answer. Let's kidnap Lesterson, and hide him away for a bit. Well, it would stop him bringing the Daleks back to life, wouldn't it? I thought it was pretty bright.  DOCTOR: There we are.  (The Doctor holds up the collection of parts he has assembled.)  BEN: What is it?  DOCTOR: What is it? It could be the answer to all our problems.
[Corridor]
(The Doctor, Ben and Polly see Quinn being escorted by a guard.)  QUINN: Ah, Examiner, don't let them fool you about the rebels. They're strong. Try and find out where they hold their meetings.  POLLY: Leave him alone!  QUINN: It's all right, Polly.  DOCTOR: We'll help him Polly, but later.  POLLY: Yes, but  DOCTOR: Now, this is a case where a little injustice is better than wholesale slaughter. What we want is in Lesterson's laboratory. Come along.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
LESTERSON: Incredible! Let's move on to test fourteen.  DALEK: I am ready.  LESTERSON: When sodium acts on ethyl alcohol, what is the resulting derivative?  DALEK: Sodium ethoxide. C2 H5 ONA.  LESTERSON: Just five seconds, Janley. Just the time it took to speak the answer.  JANLEY: It's right too.  LESTERSON: But of course it's right. Look, can you imagine what kind of positronic brain this robot has, Janley? Think of the store of knowledge that it must carry. Sulphuric acid.  DALEK: H2 SO4.  LESTERSON: Ah, you see?  DOCTOR: May I come in?  LESTERSON: What do you want?  DOCTOR: Oh, just to see how you're getting on.  LESTERSON: If you think  DOCTOR: No, please. I'm not here to cause trouble. I'm just interested, that's all.  LESTERSON: You've done nothing but meddle and interfere ever since you landed on Vulcan.  DOCTOR: Well, I did give you permission to open up the capsule, now didn't I? Oh please, carry on.  LESTERSON: And you won't try to stop me?  DOCTOR: Stop you? No, of course not. We got off on the wrong foot, Lesterson, but I'm a reasonable man, and I've been thinking perhaps I was hasty.  LESTERSON: Well, if you really want to call a truce.  DOCTOR: A truce? My dear fellow, I'd like to be friends.  LESTERSON: Yes. Yes, very well, you may stay.  DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Thank you.  (The Doctor hustles Ben and Polly out of the lab.)  DOCTOR: Perhaps you'd like to amuse yourselves for a little while.  (On the other side of the room, Janley answers the communicator.)  JANLEY: Laboratory. Yes. All right. I can come now. Right.  (Janley picks up a cloth-wrapped bundle from the desk and conceals it behind her back.)  JANLEY: I just have to slip out for a few minutes, Lesterson, all right?  LESTERSON: Ah, yes, yes. Very well then, Examiner, shall we test its knowledge of physics?  DOCTOR: Oh, splendid, splendid. Please, please, carry on.  LESTERSON: Thank you. What is the First Law of Thermodynamics?  DALEK: When heat is transformed into any other kind of energy or vice versa, the total quantity of energy remains invariable.  (As the Dalek gives the answer, the Doctor slips the modified control unit from his pocket and connects it to the generator.)  DALEK: That is to say, the quantity of heat which disappears is equivalent to the quantity of other kind of energy produced.  (The Doctor activates his device and the Dalek begins to spin helplessly, its eye and sucker sticks twitching uncontrollably.)  LESTERSON: You fool! What do you think you're doing?  DOCTOR: I'm saving your life!  (Lesterson smashes the control unit and pushes the Doctor towards the doors.)  LESTERSON: Get out! Get out!  DALEK: I have sustained no damage.  (The Dalek swings round to watch the Doctor leave, the mechanism behind its empty gun-socket clicking in useless frustration.)
[Governor's office]
JANLEY: It's all right. It's been done.  BRAGEN: You were able to get away then?  JANLEY: Yes. Lesterson's with the Examiner. And Hensell?  BRAGEN: At a meeting of production managers. He left me in control.  JANLEY: We could take over the colony now.  BRAGEN: No. No, it has to be absolutely right. I don't want to take over a colony full of rebels do I, Janley?  JANLEY: I don't know. You're making me help them.  BRAGEN: Only to stir them up to create enough trouble to get rid of Hensell, and then, then we crush them. The whole colony will be grateful, and I'll be Governor.  (Janley unwraps the bundle.)  BRAGEN: Is that the gun you told me of? Can you persuade the rebels this will help them?  JANLEY: Yes, Valmar thinks he can work in a switch to turn it on and off.  BRAGEN: How powerful is it?  JANLEY: It killed Resno, Lesterson's assistant. Lesterson believes that Resno's simply shaken up, taking a few days off.  BRAGEN: And the body?  JANLEY: In the mercury swamp. Lesterson was the indirect cause of Resno's death. It's a good hold over him if he makes trouble. I'll give this to Valmar then?  BRAGEN: Yes.  JANLEY: When do we move?  BRAGEN: I need another card in my hand. The Examiner bothers me.  JANLEY: I thought Quinn was the danger.  BRAGEN: Not any more. The Examiner's no fool. No, there has to be something else.
[Corridor]
(A little later, Ben and Polly are searching for the Doctor.)  POLLY: Well?  BEN: Well, he's not in the laboratory. Lesterson's by himself.  POLLY: Hmm. He must have gone another way. Can I leave it you? I'm going to go back to the rest room.  BEN: But  POLLY: Somebody's got to clear it up.  BEN: Okay.  (Ben leaves. Janley appears.)  JANLEY: Hello there.  POLLY: Hello. You're Lesterson's assistant aren't you?  JANLEY: Yes. You're not looking for the Examiner, are you?  POLLY: Well, do you know where he is?  JANLEY: Yes, he's waiting to get a message through from Earth. He's in the Communications room.  POLLY: Erm.  JANLEY: Oh, you'll find it easy enough. Look. Around, then to your right, in the next block.  POLLY: Thanks very much.  (Janley follows Polly at a short distance.)
[Communications room]
POLLY: Doctor? Anyone here?  (A technician looms from the shadows and grabs Polly, putting his hand over her mouth.)  JANLEY: Well done, Valmar.  (Janley breaks a phial into a handkerchief.)  JANLEY: Hold her. Hold her.  (With the handkerchief over her nose and mouth, Polly sags unconscious in Valmar's arms.)  JANLEY: There, that'll keep her quiet for a bit.  VALMAR: I've no idea who she is. She was just snooping around.  JANLEY: I sent her. We want her kept out of the way. Get a couple of your men to keep her in a safe place. Now, this is what I told you about.  VALMAR: Yes. The lethal power must come from here.  JANLEY: Uh huh.  VALMAR: It should have quite a good range.  JANLEY: Can you fix it?  VALMAR: It's easy. This could win us the revolution.
[Guest quarters]
(The Doctor is stretched out on the bed, playing his recorder.)  BEN: She said she was coming back here. She knew the way, and she wouldn't have wandered off. I know she wouldn't! Oh!  DOCTOR: Ben, if you were a Dalek, what would be your next move?  BEN: I'm talking about Polly.  DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. She's a clever girl, but she couldn't answer this.  BEN: But she is missing!  DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no.  BEN: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!  DOCTOR: No, no, no! She's looking around. There's a lot to see in the colony. She's interested. I like that.  BEN: Come on.  DOCTOR: Where are we going?  BEN: To report it. If we make a fool of ourselves, I don't care. We report it!
[Lesterson's laboratory]
LESTERSON: Yes, yes, yes. I managed to stop that fool of an Examiner just in time. You know, there are some people here who believe that you're an enemy.  DALEK: I am your servant. What does this machine do?  LESTERSON: You know, it's amazing. You have an almost human interest and curiosity.  DALEK: A Dalek is bet, is not the same as a human. If I am to help, I must know everything.  LESTERSON: Yes. Yes, of course.  DALEK: What is this machine?  LESTERSON: It computes meteorite storms as they approach our weather satellites.  DALEK: How accurate is it?  LESTERSON: About seventy percent. It helps to cut down on our satellite losses.  DALEK: Daleks can build computers with one hundred percent accuracy.  LESTERSON: One hundred percent?  DALEK: If you provide materials and our own power unit, a computer will be built.  LESTERSON: A hundred percent? But that would be an enormous saving for the for the colony.  DALEK: Then you will get the materials?  LESTERSON: I'll go and speak to the Governor at once.  DALEK: I will be ready to dictate the blueprint when you return.  LESTERSON: Oh, that's marvellous.  (Lesterson leaves. The Dalek moves to the generator and adjusts a control. As the power rises, the Dalek glides inside the capsule.)
[Corridor]
(Ben realises the Doctor is lagging behind.)  BEN: You agreed we'd go and see Bragen.  DOCTOR: Hmm? Power.  BEN: Come on then!  DOCTOR: Now the energy intake for Daleks should be the cube  (The Doctor rips a notice from the notice board, and starts scribbling on the back.)  DOCTOR: Now then, twenty two over three. Nineteen times  BEN: Well, now what are you at? Talk to yourself.  DOCTOR: Oh, it's useless with incomplete data!  (The Doctor smoothes the notice flat again and pins it back on the board. Then he ducks out of sight.)  DOCTOR: Lesterson!  BEN: Eh?  DOCTOR: He just went past. That means we can get into his laboratory again.  BEN: But we're looking for  DOCTOR: Oh, come along, Ben. Come along.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(The Doctor sees a thick cable stretching from the power unit into the capsule.)  BEN: There's somebody in there.  DALEK: What are you doing here?  DOCTOR: Stand aside. Servants shouldn't question.  DALEK: Entry is restricted.  DOCTOR: Not for me it isn't. Accord every access. I've got a badge.  DALEK: That is an order.  DOCTOR: A Dalek order. Short circuit the generator, Ben.  DALEK: Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Stand back!  DOCTOR: Don't be frightened of it, Ben. It's not armed. I'm going to see what it was doing in there.  (The Doctor stops as two armed Daleks glide from the capsule.)  DOCTOR: Ben?  BEN: What?  DOCTOR: Let's get out of here.  BEN: The fool. Lesterson must have reactivated them.  DOCTOR: Yes. When I say run, run like a rabbit. Run!  (The Doctor and Ben dash the lab.)  DALEK: I have sent the human being for materials.  DALEK 2: And power?  DALEK: Yes. Power we can turn into static. Then we will conquer.  DALEKS: We will conquer. We will conquer. We will conquer.
[Governor's office]
DOCTOR: But if you didn't do it, Lesterson, then the Dalek must have used your power supply and reactivated the others itself.  LESTERSON: I was going to do that anyway.  BEN: Are you off your head, mate? Those two are armed!  LESTERSON: Then we turn off the electricity, disarm them, and then everything is safe again.  DOCTOR: But I've already explained to you.  HENSELL: Stop these arguments, both of you. I've had enough. I've every confidence in Lesterson. He has carte blanche for the Daleks from now on.  DOCTOR: But they must be destroyed!  HENSELL: Bragen, I'm making a tour of the perimeter. I put you in direct charge here. See that Lesterson gets everything he wants, will you?  (Hensell leaves.)  LESTERSON: I shall need a permanent guard on my laboratory, Bragen.  DOCTOR: Huh.  (The Doctor leaves, followed by Ben.)  BRAGEN: Don't worry about the Examiner. I think I can keep him quiet.
[Guest quarters]
BEN: We've been forgetting about Polly.  DOCTOR: Greed and ambition, that's all it is. Wait till they find out what their precious production figures have cost them!  (Bragen enters.)  BEN: Oh, I want to see you.  BRAGEN: What about?  BEN: Well it's Polly, she's missing. We can't find her anywhere.  (The Doctor starts playing his recorder.)  BRAGEN: I'll tell one of my men to make enquiries. It shouldn't take long to find her.  BEN: Ah, thanks.  BRAGEN: Examiner, some of my men have found a body in the mercury swamp. It was the body of a middle-aged man.  DOCTOR: What is that to do with me?  BRAGEN: You're the Examiner. Or maybe you're not.  DOCTOR: Just exactly what do you mean by that?  BRAGEN: Who are you? Quinn's friends come to stir up rebellion?  DOCTOR: There's only one possible way that you could know I'm not the Examiner.  BEN: Yeah, by knowing what the real Examiner looked like.  DOCTOR: Exactly, Ben. Exactly! Only two people knew of his arrival on this planet. Myself and his murderer.  BRAGEN: That's enough!  BEN: Is it? Doctor, we've got to tell the Governor.  BRAGEN: Do you think he'll believe you? I'll soon convince him that you murdered the man yourself. You stole the Examiner's badge.  DOCTOR: Then why don't you arrest us? Because there's a doubt isn't there? Because it might, it just might, go against you.  BRAGEN: All right, all right, so neither of us wants to make a move. But you leave Lesterson alone. And the Daleks!  (Bragen leaves.)  BEN: He'd make a right Father Christmas, wouldn't he?  DOCTOR: Oh, I'd rather fight a hundred of his sort than just one Dalek.  (An envelope is pushed under the door. Ben opens the door but the corridor is empty. Ben picks up the letter.)  BEN: Listen to this. The girl is safe. She will remain so as long as you leave the Daleks alone.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Two gun-sticks are on the bench.)  LESTERSON: And did you disarm the other two?  DALEK: Yes. We are your servants. We do not need guns.  LESTERSON: I'm very glad. I knew the Examiner was wrong about you.  DALEK: Did you get our materials?  LESTERSON: Yes. Everything you need you can have.  DALEK: And a power plant?  LESTERSON: Everything.  (The other two Daleks emerge from the capsule, both disarmed.)  DALEK: We will get our power.  DALEKS: We will get our power. We will get our power. We will get our power.
Episode Four
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(As the Daleks close in, Lesterson goes to the generator and cuts the power supply. Instantly, the Daleks movements become sluggish.)  DALEK: (slow) Turn back the power supply.  LESTERSON: I will, I will. But I want you to remember that I control you.  DALEK: We are your servants.  LESTERSON: I know. Remember it. I gave you each a special charge to bring you back to life. Any further power you need must come from this generator, and I control it. Is that clear?  DALEK: We obey.  (Lesterson returns the generator to full power. Two of the Daleks return to the capsule.)  LESTERSON: Where are they going?  DALEK: To await your orders, master.  LESTERSON: Good. Have you completed the blueprints for the meteor storm computer?  DALEK: It is ready.  (They go to a table.)  LESTERSON: Oh, it's marvellous! I'm glad we understand each other.  DALEK: We understand the human mind.
[Governor's office]
(Bragen is dressed in the uniform of a Deputy Governor now. Valmar is repairing the communications desk.)  BRAGEN: Isn't that finished yet?  VALMAR: Nearly. This is Valmar. Test call please.  (The communicator buzzes.)  VALMAR: Terrace. So I can hear you clearly all right, good. Now try and get in connection now with the interior, and then the perimeter stations. Well, no troubles now.  BRAGEN: About time. This work should have been completed long before this.  VALMAR: Well, I did the best I could.  BRAGEN: Well, it isn't good enough.  VALMAR: Then get someone else, Bragen.  BRAGEN: Be careful. I shall be watching you, Valmar, after this. Now get out.  (There's a commotion outside.)  BEN [OC]: See Bragen.  DOCTOR [OC]: Accord every access.  BRAGEN: What does this intrusion mean?  GUARD: I'm sorry, Bragen. I tried to stop them.  DOCTOR: Intrusion? It's no intrusion. We're just returning the various calls that you made. This guard tried to tell us you were busy. You're not a bit, are you?  BRAGEN: All right, I'll see them.  DOCTOR: Oh, what a nice new uniform. Very smart, very smart. I would like a hat like that.  BRAGEN: Well, what do you want?  BEN: Some joker has kidnapped Polly and sent us this note.  DOCTOR: Yes.  BEN: Well, we want to know what you're doing to find her.  BRAGEN: Now that the communications are restored we can start a search.  BEN: Yeah, I can just imagine what kind of job you'll make of that. Haven't you heard anything yet?  BRAGEN: The planet is a large one.  (A Dalek enters, carrying a drink on a tray.)  DOCTOR: So, they've given you the run of the colony, have they?  DALEK: We obey.  (The Doctor picks up a chair as if to defend himself.)  DALEK: Do I bring liquid for your visitors?  BRAGEN: No. They won't be staying much longer.  (The Dalek leaves.)  BEN: Look, Doctor, if he's not going to help us, we'll have to search for Polly ourselves.  BRAGEN: Sound advice. Why don't you, Doctor?  DOCTOR: Uh, uh. Examiner. I wonder how much longer they'll be able to move around on these floors?  BEN: Ay?  DOCTOR: The floors. They're not metal.  BEN: Doctor.  (The Doctor and Ben leave. The video communicator on the desk flashes on.)  HENSELL [on monitor]: Ah, there you are Bragen. Thank heavens the communications are working again. It's bad enough being stuck out here on the perimeter. Well? Your report, man. Hurry up. I've got a very full schedule.  BRAGEN: There is nothing to report, Governor.  HENSELL [on monitor]: The Examiner?  BRAGEN: I'm taking good care of him.  HENSELL [on monitor]: Good, you know my orders.  BRAGEN: Yes, sir.  HENSELL [on monitor]: All right. Well, you can reach me here if you have to, that's all.  BRAGEN: One moment, Governor. When will you be coming back?  HENSELL [on monitor]: Oh, not for a day or two at least. You can manage, can't you?  BRAGEN: Yes. Yes, of course, Governor.  (The Dalek has returned.)  BRAGEN: What do you want?  DALEK: Have you finished your liquid?  BRAGEN: No. No, I haven't.
[Corridor]
(Janley is pinning a new sign to the notice board. Moving on, she meets Kebble and sends him to the board.)  JANLEY: You'd better check the agenda.  KEBBLE: I'll do it now.  (Kebble hurries away as the Doctor and Ben approach.)  DOCTOR: Static, do you see. They need a constant supply of static from the floor. Some sort of electrical field.  (Ben sees Kebble leaving.)  BEN: Doctor. Why should he?  (Three Daleks go past.)  DOCTOR: It's madness!  BEN: What is?  DOCTOR: Letting them run around like this.  BEN: Hey, wait a minute. Bragen had one acting as a servant, and we've just left him.  DOCTOR: One Dalek in Bragen's office. Three Daleks just gone down the corridors. That makes four.  BEN: Where did the fourth one come from?  DOCTOR: Well, Lesterson can't have been making them. Perhaps there were more in the capsule than we thought.  BEN: We must go and see Lesterson. Yeah, and show him this note. Maybe he or Janley knows where Polly is.  (The Doctor gazes at the notice board. Kebble comes back then turns away again when he sees Ben.)  BEN: We frightened him off. I wonder what the fascination of this notice board is?  DOCTOR: It looks like a perfectly ordinary notice board to me.  BEN: Yeah, well, come on, Doctor. We must find out who's got Polly. Doctor, come on!  (The Doctor follows Ben. Kebble returns.)
[Lesterson's laboratory]
LESTERSON: Janley?  JANLEY: What is it?  LESTERSON: The Daleks. They've given me another list of materials they need.  JANLEY: Let me see. We've got all those things?  LESTERSON: Yes, but why these quantities, Janley? Why? How can they have used up all the materials I gave them? What is it? Why, it's only a matter of a few hours ago.  JANLEY: They're building new things for us.  LESTERSON: Yes, well, I don't want them to do anything without consulting me. What is it they do inside there?  JANLEY: You're worrying too much.  LESTERSON: Look, Janley, say what you like, but I'm beginning to believe that the Examiner is right about the Daleks. Their original thinking terrifies me. If we can control them, fine. But if not  JANLEY: Yes?  LESTERSON: Then I shall have them destroyed. It's too dangerous. The Examiner knows something about them that we don't. I'm going to ask his advice.  JANLEY: I wouldn't bring the Examiner into it if I were you.  LESTERSON: And why not?  JANLEY: You want him to find out about Resno?  LESTERSON: Oh, a little accident. How is he? Is he better?  JANLEY: He's dead.  LESTERSON: What are you talking about? You told me he was  JANLEY: You were busy with the experiments on the Daleks.  LESTERSON: But you should have told me. But the body? It'll have to be reported.  JANLEY: Don't worry, no one will find the body.  LESTERSON: Oh, Janley, you've done a terrible thing.  JANLEY: The experiments on the Daleks were more important.  LESTERSON: More important than human life? No, no, I won't accept that.  JANLEY: You will. You must. Your carelessness was the cause of Resno's death. You murdered him. It's only your word against mine.  LESTERSON: I won't be blackmailed by you.  JANLEY: All I want is for you to go on as you are. Scientific discovery can't stop dead, Lesterson.  (The Doctor and Ben enter.)  LESTERSON: I told the guard that no-one was to be allowed in.  DOCTOR: Accord every access, remember?  BEN: We're looking for Polly.  LESTERSON: Well, she isn't here, and I haven't seen her.  BEN: Well, she's been kidnapped.  LESTERSON: Oh, it sounds a little unlikely.  BEN: Oh, it does, does it? Well, we've got this note which tells us so.  LESTERSON: I'm very sorry, but I don't know anything about it.  DOCTOR: Lesterson?  LESTERSON: Yes?  DOCTOR: You haven't been building Daleks, have you?  LESTERSON: Building? No, I wouldn't know how to begin.  DOCTOR: And there were only three in the capsule?  LESTERSON: Yes.  DOCTOR: Well, we've just seen four. One in the Governor's office and three in the corridor.  LESTERSON: But that's not possible!  DOCTOR: There's only one explanation. The Daleks are reproducing themselves.  JANLEY: These things are machines. How could they reproduce?  DOCTOR: Machines? What makes you think they're just machines? The Daleks are brilliant engineers. Nothing is beyond them given the right materials.  LESTERSON: What?  DOCTOR: I said nothing is beyond them given the right materials.  LESTERSON: Oh.  DOCTOR: Lesterson, what's the matter?  LESTERSON: Oh.  JANLEY: Leave him alone. He's just been overworking, that's all.  BEN: Well, he looks bad.  JANLEY: Will you both go away. Guard! It's you, badgering him with questions. You've done nothing but hound him ever since you arrived on Vulcan. Bragen's orders were that no one was to be admitted.  GUARD: Yes, but I thought that the Examiner.  JANLEY: He attacked Lesterson. Get them out of here. Both of them.  BEN: He did not attack Lesterson!  JANLEY: Out, do you hear?  BEN: All right, all right.  (The guard leads the Doctor and Ben out. Janley uses the communications unit.)  JANLEY: Janley here. Tell Valmar to come over to the lab right away. Good. Now, it's all right. Come on. Rest here for a bit. There. You've been doing far too much.  (Janley gives Lesterson a glass of water.)  JANLEY: Shh.  (When Valmar arrives, Lesterson is fast asleep.)  JANLEY: I've sedated him.  VALMAR: Well, what's the matter with him?  JANLEY: Overwork, I suppose. He just suddenly broke up. Anyway, it'll give you a chance to lay in the new power cable the Daleks have asked for.  VALMAR: You don't miss a trick, do you?  (Janley goes to the Dalek capsule.)  JANLEY: We're going to lay in the new cables you wanted.  DALEK: Good.  VALMAR: You're sure this is okay, Janley?  JANLEY: Of course. We help them, they help us.  DALEK: Yes. We are your servants.  JANLEY: Don't take too long about it, Valmar. Oh, you saw the notice, did you?  VALMAR: I saw it.
[Corridor]
(Back at the notice board.)  BEN: Well, we're still no nearer finding Polly. What are we hanging about here for?  DOCTOR: Ben, I've found a message in code. It's an anagram, you just take the capital letters, see? Work it out yourself.  BEN: Oh, I can't do crosswords.  DOCTOR: Meeting tonight, 2000 hours. R O C K E T -- Rocket. R O O M - Room. P. Rocket Room P.  (The Doctor lets a Dalek go past.)  DOCTOR: It's the rebel's way of calling a meeting. Only tonight we're going to be there, early.  BEN: Yeah, maybe we're nearer finding Polly than I thought.
[Rocket room P]
(Later, the Doctor and Ben are hiding behind a pile of boxes.)  BEN: Ow. I've got pins and needles now.  DOCTOR: What's the time?  BEN: Time we went home.  DOCTOR: Yes.  (The rebels start filing into the room, taking their places around a large table. Valmar brings a Dalek in. Janley has a Dalek gun-stick attached to a control box. Valmar fastens the gun-stick to the Dalek. )  JANLEY: Now, we're going to demonstrate something. You section leaders can pass on what you've seen. So far, we've been concerned with testing the strength of the Governor with a few acts of sabotage. But now we're ready to take over.  KEBBLE: What is that thing? I've seen them moving about, but all we've been told is that it's a machine Lesterson discovered.  JANLEY: Valmar.  VALMAR: Lesterson removed the armaments of the Daleks he discovered. I've rearmed this one, but with a controlling device. We can regulate the fire power and turn it off and on whenever we choose.  JANLEY: Shall we have the demonstration now?  (A shadowy figure nods.)  BEN: That's the one we want. He must be the boss of this outfit.  JANLEY: This screen is two inch thick tungsten steel. Right, Valmar.  VALMAR: Fire at the screen.  (The metal screen is totally destroyed. Consternation.)  JANLEY: Quiet! You must keep quiet. We're too vulnerable here.  KEBBLE: But you can't control a thing like that. It'll turn on us.  JANLEY: No, it won't.  KEBBLE: I wouldn't let any of my group go anywhere near it.  VALMAR: I can control it.  KEBBLE: Prove it. Ah, you daren't! I'm not talking about that thing firing at the wall or bits of metal or anything. I mean people. Have you tested whether you can stop it from killing people? Our people?  VALMAR: Look, I can show you what I've done here.  KEBBLE: Forget it. How do you know a Dalek can tell the difference between the Governor's people and our people?  VALMAR: But I can tell the difference, you fool, and I control it.  KEBBLE: We want something better than words.  JANLEY: Test it on me. Will that satisfy you?  KEBBLE: Well yes, but  BEN: She's out of her mind.  (Valmar looks at the man in the shadows.)  VALMAR: Is it all right?  (The man agrees. Janley stands in front of the Dalek.)  VALMAR: Now, when I tell you to fire  DALEK: I am your servant.  (Valmar flicks a switch, and taps the Dalek on its dome. The weapon does no damage.)  JANLEY: Get back to your places.  KEBBLE: Are you all right?  JANLEY: Of course. I don't take needless risks.  VALMAR: Oh, well done, Janley.  JANLEY: You haven't disarmed the Dalek. Well, go on, take the gun away. We don't want any accidents. Now, what about the girl?  KEBBLE: We've got her safely locked up. Never fear.  JANLEY: I think the best thing for us to do is  BEN: Hear that? Maybe they'll say were she is.  (Ben sends a box crashing to the floor.)  JANLEY: Who's there?  BEN: You stay there, I'll distract them. Find out where Polly is.  JANLEY: No!  BEN: Help! Help!  (Ben runs out and Kebble grabs him and knocks him out.)  JANLEY: The guards will have heard that! Come on we've got to get out of here! Take him and lock him up! Quick! Out!  (Kebble and another man drag Ben away. Janley and the rebels follow, leaving the leader and the Dalek in the room.)  BRAGEN: You might as well come out. We know you're there.  (The Dalek goes to the Doctor's hiding place.)  DOCTOR: Bragen.  BRAGEN: Of course. Who else is fitted to be leader of the rebels?  DOCTOR: No doubt you want to be leader of the Daleks too.  BRAGEN: I am the leader of the Daleks.  DOCTOR: Well, see if you can stop this one from killing me.  BRAGEN: Stop! You heard me, that's an order. Turn away. Fetch the guard.  (The Dalek hesitates.)  DALEK: I obey.  DOCTOR: You hope to have it both ways, Bragen. But how will you look in front of the Governor, when I explain your dual role to him?  BRAGEN: The Governor will hardly listen to an impostor.  DOCTOR: An impostor? How do you propose to prove that?  BRAGEN: My guards are now going to produce the body of the real Examiner from the mercury swamp.  DOCTOR: The one you murdered.  BRAGEN: The one you pretended to be.  DOCTOR: Murder's a far worse crime than impersonation.  BRAGEN: Yes, but you can't prove I'm a murderer, while I can prove that you're an impostor.  (The Dalek returns with Janley and two guards.)  BRAGEN: Take this man away. Detain him.  (The guards escort the Doctor out.)  JANLEY: A dangerous man.  BRAGEN: Now the only one left is the Governor.  JANLEY: Perhaps we should have dealt with the Examiner earlier.  BRAGEN: I'll deal with him in time, and Quinn.
[Cell block]
(A guard uses a sonic key to open the cell next to Quinn, put the Doctor inside and relock it. The guards leave.)  QUINN: You're the last man I expected to see here.  DOCTOR: Hmm. Works by sound, does it?  QUINN: I'm speaking to you, Examiner.  DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry.  QUINN: If you'd listened to me in the first place, you wouldn't be locked up here now.  DOCTOR: Well, your imprisonment hasn't been entirely wasted. It's brought your enemy out into the open.  QUINN: Bragen? I've known that all along.  DOCTOR: Yes. But did you know that he was the leader of the rebels?  QUINN: Bragen, the leader?  DOCTOR: Yes. It's quite a simple sort of lock, really.  (The Doctor empties his pockets.)  QUINN: Hensell's trouble is he thinks he can run this colony on his personality alone.  DOCTOR: But even if he knew of the danger, could he do anything? The rebels are well organised.  QUINN: The Governor's popular. He can count on the mine workers at the perimeter for support.  DOCTOR: In that case we must get word to him.  QUINN: If you'd done your job properly, Examiner, you wouldn't be here now, and I'd have been out too.  DOCTOR: Ah yes, but then I'm not the real Examiner.  (The Doctor chooses a dog whistle from his collection.)  DOCTOR: Ben, Polly and I, we're just travellers, that's all. I found the Examiner dead. Bragen murdered him.  (The Doctor blows the high pitched whistle at the lock.)  QUINN: Everything leads back friend Bragen. Just give me a chance get my hands on him.  DOCTOR: We aren't going to have that chance unless we can get out of here.  QUINN: There's just a little matter of the cell doors.  (The doors don't open, but a dog starts barking outside.)
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Lesterson wakes. He gets a wet handkerchief and presses it to his face. A Dalek enters and he hides. It goes to the capsule and another Dalek comes out.)  DALEK 2: You sent for me?  DALEK: Take up a position at the communications room. Watch and report.  DALEK 2: I obey.  LESTERSON: They're conspiring together! Oh, why didn't I realise? The Examiner was right. They are evil!  (Two more Daleks come out of the capsule and all three leave.)  LESTERSON: There are four. They can't be reproducing!
[Capsule]
(Lesterson discovers a new section has been opened up, A corridor slopes down and away round a corner. Mechanical sounds echo from below. Lesterson goes through two doors to a small ante-room. Through a glass wall he sees a huge chamber with a long production line. At the far end, the lower half of a Dalek appears on the conveyor belt. It goes under an archway where mechanical arms reach in to do something then pull back. Then the casing is steam-cleaned and smothered in foam. Further along the belt it stops by a tank, where another Dalek nets a green tentacled creature and puts it into the casing where probes insert themselves into its body. Under a second archway, the Dalek receives it's dome. A final spray, and the machine comes to life. It leaves the conveyor belt for it's final check as another lower case has started it's journey at the far end.)  DALEK: Dalek nine complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  NEW DALEK: (under the count) We are the new race of Daleks.  DALEK: Dalek ten complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  DALEK: Dalek eleven complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  DALEK: Dalek twelve complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  DALEK: Dalek thirteen complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  DALEK: Dalek fourteen complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  DALEK: Dalek fifteen complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  DALEK: Dalek sixteen complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  DALEK: Dalek seventeen complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  DALEK: Dalek eighteen complete.
Episode Five
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Lesterson closes the capsule door, then drags a heavy cabinet in front of it. Janley enters.)  JANLEY: What's the matter? What is it? Are you ill?  LESTERSON: They're in there, making themselves! Duplicating!  JANLEY: What? What are you talking about?  LESTERSON: I started this, opening the capsule.  JANLEY: Lesterson!  LESTERSON: Don't try to stop me!  JANLEY: What happened?  (The generator is turned off.)  LESTERSON: They forget that I control them. I gave them life back again, and now I've taken it away. Finished it, stopped it.  JANLEY: The Daleks?  LESTERSON: Evil. Horrible. I know what I'm going to do. Laser torches. Melt them down. I'm going to melt the Daleks down to pools of metal.  JANLEY: You won't, Lesterson.  LESTERSON: Oh, do you think I care what you can do? Go on, tell everybody I was responsible for Resno's death. I don't care! I'm going to wipe out the Daleks! Yes, tell everybody all about me! I'm still going to I'm going to wipe out the Daleks!  (Janley leaves. Lesterson lifts the communications receiver.)  LESTERSON: Get me the Examiner. Prison? Who put him there? But I've got to talk to him! I've got to, don't you understand?  (The capsule door opens, pushing the cabinet aside. A Dalek moves up behind Lesterson.)  LESTERSON: How did you get there? I cut off the power.  DALEK: We can store power. We will soon have our own.  LESTERSON: Own power?  DALEK: Why was the capsule door closed?  LESTERSON: Own power! Argh!  (Lesterson flees. Another Dalek enters.)  DALEK: Seal off the capsule's secret entrance.  DALEK 2: I obey.  DALEK: Wait! No more than three Daleks to be seen together at any one time.  DALEK 2: I obey.  DALEK: We are not ready yet to teach these human beings the law of the Daleks.
[Corridor]
LESTERSON: You can help me!  GUARD: What's the matter?  LESTERSON: Where's the Examiner?  GUARD: The Examiner's in prison.  LESTERSON: Oh, yes.  GUARD: What's the matter with you?  LESTERSON: I forgot.  GUARD: What are you running for? Hey!
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Janley and Kebble take Polly to the laboratory. A Dalek comes from the capsule.)  JANLEY: Did Lesterson come back?  DALEK: No. Why is this human restricted?  JANLEY: She's against the Daleks. Afraid, are you? Nothing's going to happen to you if you behave.  POLLY: The Daleks? Of course I'm afraid, and so should you be.  JANLEY: The Daleks are going to help us.  POLLY: Us being the rebels, I suppose.  JANLEY: If you like.  POLLY: And when you've won, the Daleks will just go back to being servants again? You're bigger fools than I thought.  DALEK: We are your servants.  POLLY: While it suits you.  JANLEY: You'll see.  KEBBLE: In!  (Kebble pushes Polly into the capsule.)  KEBBLE: You want me to stay with her?  JANLEY: Yes. You may have to help Valmar. He'll be here in a minute to fix up the new Dalek power cable.  KEBBLE: Right.  DALEK: When will the work be completed?  JANLEY: What is this cable you Daleks are laying, anyway?  DALEK: Daleks operate on static electricity.  JANLEY: Static! Is that possible?  DALEK: To create static, the Daleks need a complete cable circuit.  JANLEY: I see. You convert our electricity into your own power.  DALEK: That is correct. When will the human being complete the work?  JANLEY: He'll be here. It's easier now. There's no-one to interfere with our plans.
[Cell block]
(The dog whistle has not done the trick so the Doctor is running a wet finger around the rim of a glass instead.)  QUINN: Do you have to do that? I'm afraid you'll find these locks are foolproof.  DOCTOR: I wonder how they're converting the power?  QUINN: What are you talking about?  DOCTOR: The Daleks. They're powered by static electricity. It's like blood to them, a constant life-stream.  QUINN: Static isn't workable.  DOCTOR: It is to the Daleks. They've conquered static, just as they've conquered anti-magnetics.  QUINN: I'm not going to listen to any more of this nonsense.  DOCTOR: I don't seem to be able to hit the right note. Do you have any more water?  QUINN: I hope not. No.  DOCTOR: Then I shall have to get some.  GUARD: You can't!  LESTERSON: But it's important! It's desperately important!  GUARD: Well, Bragen gave orders.  LESTERSON: Just get out of my way! Ah! Examiner! The Daleks !  DOCTOR: Yes?  LESTERSON: They're duplicating! I've seen them! They've got their own power now! I can't stop them!  GUARD: Take him to Bragen.  LESTERSON: Oh! Oh! Oh!  DOCTOR: I say. I say, do you think we might have a little more water?  QUINN: Is that all you can say? Lesterson fights his way down here to speak to you and all you can do is demand more water?  (The guard fetches a jug.)  GUARD: Get away from the door.  (The Doctor backs away and listens carefully to the tone of the sonic key. The guard puts down the jug, locks the door and leaves.)  QUINN: Sorry about that outburst. I thought it might help the situation.  (The Doctor adds a little more water to his glass.)  QUINN: Nearly, nearly.
[Governor's office]
(A Dalek is laying a cable around the room. Bragen is working at his desk when is brought in Lesterson under guard.)  BRAGEN: What's this?  GUARD: He tried to break in and speak with the Examiner.  LESTERSON: What is the Dalek doing?!  BRAGEN: I thought you knew. Something to do with the emergency power supply.  LESTERSON: Oh, no. It's a trick. I didn't ask for it.  BRAGEN: Lesterson, I've had reports.  LESTERSON: What are you doing?!  DALEK: Laying the new emergency power supply as you ordered, master.  LESTERSON: It's a lie!  BRAGEN: I've had reports of your incomprehensible behaviour.  LESTERSON: Yes. Yes, but I can explain if you'll get rid of that!  BRAGEN: Finish now.  DALEK: I am your servant.  (The Dalek leaves.)  LESTERSON: Where is the Governor?!  BRAGEN: At the perimeter. Why?  LESTERSON: Call him. Get him back here as quickly as possible. We're all in terrible danger! The Examiner was right! Right all the time!  (Janley enters.)  LESTERSON: Don't listen to anything she has to say.  JANLEY: Come along now.  LESTERSON: She's in league with the Daleks!  JANLEY: Now, now, now, now. Please, Lesterson. Just take things calmly. You're not well.  LESTERSON: I'm perfectly well!  JANLEY: Please, Lesterson, please. Now, you ought to be in hospital. You promised me you'd report there.  LESTERSON: I promised nothing of the kind.  JANLEY: Don't you remember? Never mind. I understand.  BRAGEN: Pity. It's probably only temporary.  LESTERSON: You're trying to say I'm mad.  BRAGEN: No, no, not mad.  JANLEY: No, of course not. No.  LESTERSON: But I tell you, I saw the Daleks. They were duplicating! I saw it! I swear to you!  JANLEY: He suddenly started saying these things in the lab. I'm afraid he's  LESTERSON: Oh, no! No!  BRAGEN: Keep him under restraint.  LESTERSON: Oh, will nobody listen to me?!
[Capsule]
(Polly sits on the floor, watching Valmar work on a power connector. A Dalek is watching them.)  VALMAR: Pass me that small screwdriver.  POLLY: I can't. My hands are tied. Anyway, I wouldn't help you even if I could.  VALMAR: Okay.  (Kebble appears with more cable.)  VALMAR: More? I can't handle them.  KEBBLE: This is the lot.  POLLY: Listen. The Dalek's gone now.  KEBBLE: That doesn't mean you can start talking.  VALMAR: Oh, leave her alone, Kebble. She isn't doing any harm.  POLLY: You think you're very tough don't you, pushing a girl around. I'd like to see you come up against a real man.  KEBBLE: Like who?  POLLY: Like Ben, for instance.  KEBBLE: Don't worry about him. We've got him safely stowed away.  POLLY: You've got Ben?  KEBBLE: He's sleeping off a slight fall.  VALMAR: I told you to leave her alone.  POLLY: Your name's Valmar, isn't it?  VALMAR: That's it.  POLLY: You want the Daleks to fight the Governor. But don't you see? They'll turn on you, too.  KEBBLE: What? Three big pepper pots?  VALMAR: One of them did kill Resno. And you saw what the Dalek did to that sheet of metal.  POLLY: And that's just the beginning.  KEBBLE: Don't listen to her. She's giving you the Examiner's line.  POLLY: He isn't the Examiner. We're just travellers, landed here by accident. The Doctor, that's the man you think is the Examiner, found the real Examiner dead and picked up his papers.  VALMAR: This Doctor of yours. He knows something about the Daleks?  POLLY: He's tried to warn everyone. It's the only reason we stayed here.  DALEK: When will the work be completed?  VALMAR: I don't know. I'll need a new junction box like this one.  (The Dalek leaves.)  POLLY: You've all underestimated these Daleks.  KEBBLE: Better brains than us, I suppose.  POLLY: I only know what the Doctor has told me. He says they're capable of exterminating whole nations.  VALMAR: Perhaps, but what would they want to kill us for, after we've taken over. We're friendly with the Daleks.  POLLY: But don't you see? Human beings can't be friends with Daleks. They don't have friends.  VALMAR: I don't see why not.  POLLY: It's a kind of hatred for anything unlike themselves. They think they're superior.  VALMAR: The girl's got something.  KEBBLE: You want to tell Janley, you're welcome.  POLLY: Janley! She'll betray the lot of you, if she gets the chance.  DALEK: The other junction box is outside.  VALMAR: Thank you.  KEBBLE: Talk too much, don't you? Didn't you know he was soft on Janley? All right, all right, I'm just putting her straight.  VALMAR: More slack on the cables.
[Corridor]
(A Dalek is laying a thick power cable along the wall. is draped over its sucker-stick. The Dalek detects the sounds of voices ahead. It turns back, and moves out of sight as two humans appear.)  HENSELL: What are all these cables lying about?  GUARD: New emergency power supply.  HENSELL: Who's idea was that?  GUARD: What do you want to know for?  HENSELL: What do I? Don't you know I'm the Governor? Where are you from?  GUARD: The interior, sir.  HENSELL: The interior? Why are you carrying a gun?  GUARD: I'm a Squad Leader in Bragen's guard, sir.  HENSELL: Oh, I see. Bragen's guard, ay? All right, carry on.
[Cell block]
GUARD: Cut that row out, you two.  (The Doctor plays his recorder as Quinn creeps out of his unlocked cell and pounces on the guard.)  GUARD: What the? Oh!  (Quinn knocks the guard out then unlocks the Doctor's cell.)  QUINN: Come on.  DOCTOR: Wait a minute.  (They lock the guard in the cell after the Doctor removes the jug and glass of water.)  DOCTOR: We don't want him trying it, although he seemed a bit tone deaf to me.
[Governor's office]
HENSELL: Well, Bragen, these trips are becoming more and more demanding.  BRAGEN: I didn't expect you, Governor.  HENSELL: Oh, I had as much as I could stand. Well, what's been happening here?  BRAGEN: One moment.  HENSELL: I asked you a question, man.  BRAGEN: I heard you.  HENSELL: Look, your work can wait. You can hand over to me tomorrow. I want to hear about the Examiner.  BRAGEN: The Examiner is at present in jail.  HENSELL: In jail? That's rather dangerous, isn't it? Who put him there?  BRAGEN: I did.  HENSELL: You did? In heaven's sake, why?  BRAGEN: He's an impostor, Governor. Possibly a murderer as well. We've just discovered the body of the real Examiner in the mercury swamp.  HENSELL: I hope you're sure of your facts, Bragen.  BRAGEN: Quite sure.  HENSELL: This could have far reaching consequences.  BRAGEN: As far as I am concerned, there's nothing more to be said. So if there's nothing further  HENSELL: Nothing further? Who the devil do you think you're talking to? Stand up when you're speaking to me, man!  BRAGEN: I prefer to remain seated.  HENSELL: Do you now? We'll soon see about that. Guards! Take this man out of my office. Did you hear what I said? That's an order!  BRAGEN: You forget, my dear Hensell. They're not your guards, they're mine.  HENSELL: I am the Governor.  BRAGEN: No. Not now. I am.  HENSELL: Oh, I see. Your guards, ay? Yes, Quinn warned me about your guards, but we all took them too lightly, didn't we? But we'll soon change that.  (Hensell moves to the door, but guards block his way.)  HENSELL: You imbecile! How long do you think your handful of guards can hang out when the people hear that I am being kept a prisoner in my own capital?  BRAGEN: The people will do exactly as they are told, Hensell. It will, of course, be easier for them if you co-operate with us.  (Bragen pushes a button on the desk, then motions for Hensell to take his seat. The Governor sits at his desk. Then a Dalek enters and stops next to Bragen.)  BRAGEN: Wait there. Guards, dismissed.  HENSELL: So, Bragen, you want my cooperation, do you?  BRAGEN: It would save bloodshed. I might even let you keep the title of Governor.  HENSELL: Might you now? I'll tell you what you will do. You'll order your guards to disarm and place yourself under arrest immediately!  BRAGEN: So you reject my offer. I thought it a generous one in the circumstances.  HENSELL: What circumstances?  BRAGEN: Look at this.  HENSELL: What is it?  (Bragen unwraps a Dalek gun-stick.)  BRAGEN: The reason that the colony is now mine.  (Bragen attaches the gun-stick to the Dalek.)  HENSELL: Is it a weapon of some kind?  BRAGEN: I'll arrange a demonstration for you. Do you still refuse my offer?  HENSELL: I will not be intimidated.  BRAGEN: Of course not. In character to the last, Hensell. Kill him!  (The Dalek obeys.)  DALEK: Why do human beings kill human beings?  BRAGEN: Get on with your work.  DALEK: Yes, master. I obey.  BRAGEN: Yes, obey me! From now on, I'll have complete obedience from everyone!
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(The Doctor and Quinn hide under a workbench. A Dalek comes out of the capsule, followed by Valmar.)  VALMAR: I'll have to check the cable circuit now. Otherwise it's just as you asked for.  DALEK: Very well.  VALMAR: Why can't you carry on with the power you're drawing from the colony? Why go to all this trouble?  DALEK: Until now, we have had to recharge from the colony supply. With static power, the Daleks will be twice as (pause) useful.  (Janley runs in.)  JANLEY: Valmar, quick!  VALMAR: What's the matter?  JANLEY: The Governor's back.  VALMAR: What about the girl?  JANLEY: Leave her.  DALEK: I will follow you.  VALMAR: What for?  DALEK: I am your servant.  JANLEY: Come on.  (Janley, Valmar and the Dalek leave. The Doctor and Quinn come out.)  DOCTOR: An electrical circuit of their own supplying static electricity! I wonder how much longer we've got?
[Capsule]
DOCTOR [OC]: I didn't realise they'd have a circuit of their own.  (Kebble picks up a wrench.)  POLLY: Doctor, look out!
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Quinn launches himself at Kebble, who feints and swings the wrench at Quinn's head. Quinn ducks and rolls to the workbench to get Lesterson's laser. He shoots Kebble in the hand and Kebble drops the wrench. Quinn knocks him out.)  POLLY: Are you all right?  DOCTOR: Well done! Who was the man who went outside just now?  POLLY: Valmar. He's been working for the Daleks.  DOCTOR: On their static power supply.  POLLY: Doctor, they've got Ben.  DOCTOR: Yes, I know. He ran away so that I could. Oh well, it's a long story. But don't worry, that boy can take care of himself.  QUINN: Did you hear that? That won't help.  DOCTOR: Get out, all of you!  QUINN: What about you?  POLLY: But Doctor!  DOCTOR: Go!  (Polly and Quinn and Polly run out into the corridor. The Doctor picks up the wrench and follows, slamming the lab doors behind him and jamming the wrench through the handles. The Dalek cannot follow.)  DALEK 2: Have they escaped?  DALEK: Yes, return to capsule and report.  DALEK 2: I obey.  (The Dalek fires its gun at the door. The door buckles and gives way, and the Dalek leaves.)
[Capsule]
DALEK: We are to wait here until the human beings fight among themselves.  DALEK 2: Then we will strike.  DALEK: And exterminate!  ALL DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
[Governor's office]
(The Doctor, Quinn and Polly discover Hensall's body.)  QUINN: The one man who could have saved us.  DOCTOR: Don't worry. The people will follow you, too.  QUINN: Maybe. But there wasn't any maybe about Hensell. He was old-fashioned, single-minded, yes, but he's done a lot of wonderful work for this colony. Events turned out against him, that's all. But why? Why was he killed?  BRAGEN: I can answer that.  (Bragen is flanked by armed guards.)  BRAGEN: He wanted to destroy the Daleks, so one of them killed him. Now I'm declaring martial law. You will be returned to prison and properly guarded this time.  DOCTOR: Martial law? What good do you think that will do against the Daleks?  BRAGEN: The Daleks will do as I tell them.  DOCTOR: We shall see, shan't we.  BRAGEN: Take them away.  (Bragen has the corpse removed.)

ALL DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!  DALEK 2: Orders received. Exterminate all humans!  DALEK: Exterminate all humans!  DALEK 2: Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy!

Episode Six
[Lesterson's laboratory]
DALEK: Take up positions, ready to exterminate all human beings.  DALEK 3: Exterminate!  ALL DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
[Corridor]
(Two guards are escorting the Doctor, Polly and Quinn to the detention area. The Doctor stops. A Dalek has taken up position ahead of them.)  GUARD: Move on!  DOCTOR: The Dalek!  POLLY: What about it?  DOCTOR: Can't you see it's armed?  GUARD: Keep moving!  (The Dalek bars their way.)  DALEK: This area is restricted.  QUINN: On whose authority?  GUARD: Silence!  DALEK: Repeat. This area is restricted.  (Another Dalek appears behind them.)  DALEK 2: Obey or you shall be exterminated.  QUINN: I thought they obeyed us?  POLLY: What do we do now, Doctor?  QUINN: This way.  (The Doctor and Polly follow Quinn, with the guards following.)  DALEK: They will be exterminated.
[Governor's office]
JANLEY: We've won. The revolution's over. I'll pass the word to Valmar, Kebble and the rest.  BRAGEN: Wait. The revolution is not quite over yet.  JANLEY: What more can we do? Hensell's dead, you're the new Governor. The battle's over.  BRAGEN: Not quite. You mentioned Kebble, Valmar and that rabble. Well, now they must be dealt with.  JANLEY: But those are our own men.  BRAGEN: Of course.  JANLEY: I don't understand.  BRAGEN: Do you think I can ever be secure in that chair while that rabble are still loose? They rebelled against Hensell yesterday. Tomorrow it'll be my turn. Well, let them rebel. Tell them the guards have taken control. Let them attack, and then we can crush them utterly.  JANLEY: You say we.  BRAGEN: Yes. We've come a long way together, you and I. Are you going to back down now?  JANLEY: Couldn't you just arrest them?  BRAGEN: Everyone must be killed.  JANLEY: Must they all be slaughtered?  BRAGEN: All of them.  (Behind Janley, Bragen reaches into a drawer and gets a pistol.)  BRAGEN: Well, are you still with me?  JANLEY: I suppose so.  BRAGEN: Then do as I say.  (Bragen lays the gun on the desk.)  BRAGEN: I'm glad you agreed with me.  (Valmar was outside and has overheard everything.)
[Corridor]
(The Doctor, Polly and Quinn now have a guard front and rear. An unarmed Dalek appears.)  DOCTOR: Now!  (Quinn takes out the rear guard. The other guard fires as they rush off, but misses them.)
[Guest quarters]
BEN: What have you brought me in here for?  VALMAR: Quiet!  BEN: Whose side are you on anyway?  VALMAR: I thought I was going to be on the winning side.  BEN: What changed your mind?  VALMAR: Bragen. The colony's become too small for him. He wants us out of the way now.  BEN: Yeah, well, it often happens that way, mate, when you follow blokes like him.  VALMAR: Look, I'm going to try and get your friends here, if I can. So wait here.
[Governor's office]
(The communications unit buzzes.)  GUARD [on monitor]: Section one reporting, Governor Bragen.  BRAGEN: Yes.  GUARD [on monitor]: The rebels are gathering. We've got them under observation.  BRAGEN: Don't let them concentrate in large groups. Hit them before they organise. They'll be making their move any time now.  GUARD [on monitor]: Right.  (Communication ends. Bragen looks over a document then makes a colony-wide broadcast.)  BRAGEN: People of Vulcan. This is your new Governor talking to you. I have to announce that Governor Hensell has been murdered by the rebels. I have taken control temporarily until order is restored. People living on the perimeter and in the interior can stay calm. We know who the murderers are.
[Guest quarters]
BRAGEN [OC]: I shall keep you informed of events as soon as I am able, so listen for the signal to watch your communication sets. That is all.  (The Doctor, Polly and Quinn enter.)  DOCTOR: Ah! There you are.  POLLY: Ben!  DOCTOR: I knew you'd be all right!  BEN: Polly, you okay?  POLLY: Oh, yes.  BEN: Did Valmar find you, then?  POLLY: Valmar? No.  QUINN: What's this about Valmar?  BEN: Well it seems Bragen's gone power mad. He wants the rebels to revolt, then he can finish them off.  DOCTOR: The Daleks won't care who they fight. They'll exterminate every human being on this planet.  POLLY: Doctor, oh please, let's go back to the Tardis.  DOCTOR: Quinn, keep them both here.  BEN: Well, wait a minute, Doctor!  (Quinn blocks Ben's way.)  BEN: All right. All right.  QUINN: Now what do you think he's up to?  DALEK [OC]: Orders received. Daleks commence extermination.  ALL DALEKS [OC]: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
[Corridor]
(Gunfire is heard everywhere.)  KEBBLE: Just a minute, Examiner.  GUARD: All right, hold it!  (The Doctor drops to the floor.)  DOCTOR: Down everyone!  (A Dalek fires, killing one of the guards. A second guard returns fire but is also killed. The Doctor grabs Kebble and they run off. The Dalek follows.)
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Valmar is connecting control wires to three Daleks.)  VALMAR: Don't come any nearer.  JANLEY: What do you mean?  VALMAR: I overheard your conversation with Bragen. But you can't stand up to the Daleks, so your plan will come to nothing.  JANLEY: Not my plan. Bragen's.  VALMAR: But that's the same thing.  JANLEY: Not any more.  VALMAR: You expect me to believe that?  JANLEY: Look, Val, he was going to kill me too. I came here to do exactly what you've done. Let Bragen see what the Daleks are like. He doesn't know how strong they are. He's got to be stopped.  DALEK: You will lead us to the middle of your party of human beings.  VALMAR: Yes.  DALEK: We will fight (pause) for you.  JANLEY: Believe me, Val, it's the only way to save all our lives.  VALMAR: Did you know that the Daleks are duplicating?  JANLEY: Yes.  DALEK: But we are your friends.  DALEK 2: We will serve you.  DALEK 3: Take us to the centre of your group.  VALMAR: Can we trust them?  JANLEY: We must! The guards have orders to wipe us out. We must use the Daleks. Come on.
[Guest quarters]
(Kebble has gone.)  POLLY: Doctor!  DOCTOR: The window. Does it open?  BEN: I don't know.  DOCTOR: It had better, or we're done for! Out you go.  POLLY: What's happening?  DOCTOR: The Daleks. They're teeming all over the corridors. We've got to get back to Lesterson's lab.  (Kebble appears in the doorway and is shot in the back by a Dalek. The Doctor gets through the window just as a Dalek enters.)
[Governor's office]
BRAGEN: This is Governor Bragen speaking. A group of rebels is attempting to take over the colony. It is the duty of all loyal citizens to help the guards resist. Stay in your homes. Order will be restored. Listen to my bulletins.  GUARD: The rebels are using the Daleks against our people!  BRAGEN: Well, get back and fight! Why do you come running to me? What do you think your guns are for?  GUARD: Well, the guns don't work against them!  BRAGEN: Get back and fight them!
[Corridor]
(The rebels have constructed a barricade of boxes. They are shooting at a group of Bragen's guards when Janley and Valmar with their controlled Daleks.)  JANLEY: There and there!  (The Dalek fires at the guards.)  JANLEY: Over there! No! No! Over there! They're our people!  VALMAR: Cut the Dalek gun off!  JANLEY: No!  (Janley deactivates the control device but the Dalek fires on the rebels.)  VALMAR: I told you to cut the gun off!  JANLEY: I did!  VALMAR: You've killed our own people!  VALMAR: We have to dismantle the gun, that's all.  JANLEY: Oh, look at it!  DALEK: Your usefulness is over.  (A guard appears, firing at the Dalek.)  JANLEY: Come on! Quick, Val. Come on!
[Lesterson's laboratory]
POLLY: Doctor, it's stupid to hide in here!  BEN: Well, do you fancy your chances outside in the corridor? No thanks.  DOCTOR: The answer must be here somewhere.  LESTERSON: Shh!  (Hearing Daleks coming from the capsule, Lesterson hides everyone under the workbench.)  LESTERSON: You must be absolutely quiet. They know everything that's going on. Everything! They even know what you're thinking.  BEN: Where do they get their power from, Lesterson?  LESTERSON: Ah, I tried to turn the power off, but they were miles ahead of me. Marvellous creatures. You have to admire them.  BEN: But we've got to stop them!  LESTERSON: Oh, it's too late for that. They're the new species, you see, taking over from homo sapiens. Man's had his day. Finished now.  DALEK: The static circuit is nearly complete.  DALEK 2: Soon we can abandon the power we are using.  (Screams outside.)  DALEK: The humans are being exterminated.  (The two Daleks go into the capsule.)  BEN: Did you hear that? They're going to use their own power.  DOCTOR: The cables they laid. The trick I tried before won't work anymore.  LESTERSON: Oh, if that's no good now, we're finished. All we can do is marvel at the creatures who are taking our place.
[Corridor]
VALMAR: No!  JANLEY: Come on!  VALMAR: Don't be a fool.  JANLEY: Come on!  (Quinn pulls Valmar to safety as a Dalek appears ahead. Janley shoots at it, but of course she dies.)
[Lesterson's laboratory]
BEN: Take it easy, Polly.  POLLY: Can't we do anything?! They're murdering everybody, one by one!  BEN: You've done all this. Why'd you give them power in the first place?  LESTERSON: Well, I could control it, you see. And then Janley got one of her men, Valmar, I think it was, yes, and he rigged up a secret cable. It's carrying power directly from the colony's supply.  DOCTOR: Where? Where is it, Lesterson?  LESTERSON: Valmar's the only one who can answer that. Or the Daleks of course. They know everything. Yes, you should ask the Daleks.  BEN: Then we must find Valmar.  DOCTOR: No. You stay here and look after Polly. I'll go.  MAN [OC]: Come on. This way. (scream)  (The Doctor uses the diversion of two guards fighting a Dalek to get away down the corridor. A woman tries to enter the lab, but is killed in the doorway. Her companion tries to wrestle the Dalek, with the usual result.)
[Corridor]
(Valmar holds Janley's body, and cries.)  QUINN: You'll have to leave her now, Valmar.  VALMAR: She wasn't as bad as you think.  DOCTOR: Valmar! Where is the Dalek power?  QUINN: Get down, both of you!  (As they play dead, a Dalek glides past them looking for signs of life, and moves on.)  DOCTOR: Valmar. Valmar! Where is the Dalek power supply?  QUINN: We've got to stop them, Valmar. She's dead. There's nothing you can do for her.  VALMAR: The main cable's inside the capsule, but there's nothing you can do.  QUINN: There must be some way of cutting off the power!  DOCTOR: What makes you think I want to do that? We need more time. I know. A diversion. Bragen's guards. We'll have to use them to keep the Daleks busy. You go to Bragen.
[Governor's office]
BRAGEN: Section One, where's your report? Are you there, Section one? Section two? Section two? Why don't they answer? Can you hear me, Section two? Section three? Oh, why don't they answer? I'm their Governor. Why don't they answer?
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(The colony is silent as the grave as the Daleks look for survivors.)  BRAGEN [OC]: This is Bragen speaking. I'm speaking to the Daleks. Daleks, listen to me. I am the Governor. You must work for me. Do not trust the rebels. I will give you whatever you want, but immobilise your guns. This is the Governor speaking.  BEN: He's nuts, trying to talk to the Daleks.  (More Daleks leave the capsule and go out into the corridor.)  BEN: Lesterson, what's in that cupboard?  LESTERSON: Nothing. It's quite empty.  BEN: Well, come on, Polly, we'll be safe in there, love.  (Ben and Polly hide in the cupboard while Lesterson stays underneath the bench.)

BRAGEN: Do you hear me, Daleks?! You will obey my orders!  QUINN: No use, Bragen. The Daleks have stopped obeying your orders.  BRAGEN: Guards!  QUINN: Dead! The Daleks have killed them. You still have your guard units in the interior. How long will it take them to get here?  BRAGEN: That depends.  QUINN: Well, get them!  BRAGEN: Well, they will be intercepted by the Daleks.  QUINN: Exactly! It will draw them away from here and give the Doctor a chance to deal with them.  BRAGEN: I refuse to allow my guards to be sacrificed.  QUINN: In that case the Daleks will destroy everything on this colony.  (Bragen switches on the communications unit.)  BRAGEN: Guards. This is Bragen speaking. All units will report immediately to the capital. Be prepared to face the rebel Daleks. There. Are you satisfied?  QUINN: I hope it works.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(The Doctor returns with Valmar.)  DOCTOR: Ben! Polly!  (Ben and Polly come out of the cupboard.)  BEN: Doctor, did you hear what Bragen said?  DOCTOR: Yes, I did.  BEN: Well, I only hope the Daleks do go for the guards.  POLLY: A lot of the Daleks went out just now.  DOCTOR: Good, because we're going inside. Come on, Valmar.  (The Doctor and Valmar go into the capsule and come out with a junction box connected to a lot of cables.)  DOCTOR: Ben, give us that spare cable over there. Polly, keep watch at the door.  BEN: Well, you know what you're doing?  DOCTOR: Of course I do.  BEN: Well, why can't you just take all the plugs out and cut the power off?  DOCTOR: Because I prefer to do it my way!  POLLY: Look out!  (Everyone takes cover as a Dalek enters. Valmar goes into the capsule with the modified junction box, just missing another Dalek coming out.)  DALEK 2: Static power is being stored. We can dismantle the human electric system.  (The Doctor starts to edge his way round the room.)  DALEK: The law of the Daleks is in force.  DALEK 2: Extermination of humans.  (Lesterson stands up.)  DALEK: Our cables have been moved.  LESTERSON: And I could tell you who did it.  DALEK: What were you doing in there?  LESTERSON: I want to help you.  DALEK: Why?  LESTERSON: (like a Dalek) I am your servant.  DALEK: We do not need humans now.  LESTERSON: Ah, but you wouldn't kill me. I gave you life.  DALEK: Yes, you gave us life.  (So the Dalek kills him. The Doctor plugs his cable into the generator. Nothing happens. The Daleks spot Valmar and turn, while the Doctor pushes every button in sight. Valmar gets through the door just before the Daleks shoot. Ben pulls Polly out of sight. There's an explosion and the Doctor is knocked down. The Daleks lose control, lights flashing and smoke coming from their casings. One powers into the wall and the other bursts into flames.)
[Colony]
(Everywhere Daleks are affected by the power surge.)  DALEK 2: There are two  DALEK: Exterminate! Ah! Ah! Exterminate!  (The corridors fill with smoke from exploding Daleks.)  DALEK: Out of control! Out of Control!  (In the capsule the machinery goes haywire and explosions rip through it.)
[Governor's office]
(A Dalek enters, but its dome blows off before it can shoot at them.)  BRAGEN: What happened to it?  QUINN: I don't know.  BRAGEN: It seems that your friend, the Examiner, was successful after all.  (Quinn relaxes, and Bragen gets the gun off him.)  BRAGEN: Now I shall restore law and order on this planet.  QUINN: Not your law, Bragen. That's finished for good.  BRAGEN: You'll obey me, or  QUINN: Your day is over, Bragen. No one will obey you now.  BRAGEN: I'm still the Governor, and you will. Valmar!  (A shot rings out, but it is Bragen who falls dead.)  VALMAR: He was a murderer.  QUINN: Enough of guns. There's a lot of clearing up to be done. We will rebuild together. What is the extent of the damage?  VALMAR: Oh, I don't know if its repairable. The whole electrical system.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
QUINN: Are you all right?  BEN: Oh, he's okay. The clot knocked himself out.  QUINN: It's a miracle. How did you do it?  DOCTOR: Eh? What happened? What did I do? What did I do?  BEN: You destroyed the Daleks, that's what you did.  POLLY: No need to be modest about it.  DOCTOR: Did I do that?  POLLY: You know you did.  VALMAR: You used the power from the colony's electric supply, overfed it and blew up their temporary static circuit. Well, didn't you?  DOCTOR: Did I do all that?  VALMAR: You may have stopped the Daleks, but have you any idea of the damage you've done to the colony?  DOCTOR: Oh. There was a blow back, was there?  VALMAR: A blow back? Our power supply has been destroyed! It'll be months before we can get things back to normal.  QUINN: Valmar!  DOCTOR: Oh, that is unfortunate.  VALMAR: But did it have to be this way?  DOCTOR: I did a lot of damage, did I?  QUINN: Come on.  (Valmar and Quinn go to check the capsule.)  DOCTOR: I think we'd better get out of here before they send us the bill.
[Mercury swamp]
(The Doctor and his companions walk to the Tardis. The Doctor is playing his recorder.)  BEN: Well, I mean I didn't expect the brass bands to be playing, but I wouldn't have thought a thank you would have hurt anybody.  POLLY: But Ben, think of all those poor people all killed.  BEN: I know, but the Doctor saved the colony from being completely wiped out.  POLLY: Hmm.  BEN: Yeah, and he was telling them all along, but would they listen?  POLLY: Mind you, he wasn't very convincing when he was trying to explain it to Valmar and Quinn and everybody.  BEN: No, he wasn't, was he?  POLLY: Doctor, you did know what you were doing, didn't you?  (The Doctor just chuckles and gives Polly a wink. There is a Dalek next to the Tardis, its casing melted and scorched.)  BEN: Oh, you needn't worry about them anymore, Doctor. Just a heap of old iron now.  (Ben taps the Dalek casing and they all go into the Tardis. Moments later it dematerialises and the Dalek's eye-stalk lifts as if to watch.)

[Culloden moor]

(1746. Scottish Highland clans, loyal to Bonnie Prince Charles Edward, battle with the English and German regiments loyal to the English monarch, King George. Finally overpowered by superior forces, the Highlanders break ranks and leave the battlefield. The leader of Clan McLaren, Colin, is badly injured. His son Alexander, daughter Kirsty and a young piper called Jamie McCrimmon, accompany him. Confronted on the path by two Redcoats, Alexander engages the soldiers in a sword fight. He kills one Redcoat and the other flees, allowing the small group to move on seeking refuge. The Tardis materialises in small hollow, concealed from view by bushes and brambles. Ben comes out, followed by Polly and the Doctor.) 
POLLY: It's so cool. 
BEN: Hey, Polly. 
POLLY: What? 
BEN: Where does this remind you of? 
POLLY: Oh, it's cold and damp. 
BEN: No, where does it remind you of? 
POLLY: Ouch! Prickles! What? 
BEN: Where else could it be? We're home, Duchess! 
POLLY: Oh, you never give up hope, do you? We'll ask the Doctor. Hey, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Listen. 
(There's an explosion in the distance.) 
BEN: It sounds like the cup final. 
(Something whistles towards them, fast.) 
POLLY: Look out! 
(Ben and Polly throw themselves to the ground as the something goes Boom nearby. The Doctor hides in the brambles, hands over his head.) 
DOCTOR: What are you doing down there? 
BEN: What was it? It looks like an old-time cannon ball. Ow! It's hot. 
DOCTOR: Allow me. Yes, a ten pounder. That does it. 
POLLY: But Doctor, we can't leave. This looks like England. 
BEN: Yeah, I'm going to look over that hill. 
POLLY: Doctor, you don't want us to think you're afraid, do you? 
DOCTOR: Why not? 
POLLY: Look, we can't let Ben go up there on his own. We don't know what he's going to find. Come on.

[Cottage]

(In a ruined cottage, Kirsty is tending her father's wounds.) 
COLIN: Ahh, Kirsty. Ahh. 
KIRSTY: He badly needs a doctor.
(Everyone say Hi to Hannah Gordon.) 
ALEXANDER: Aye, and food. 
COLIN: Water. Water. 
KIRSTY: Whist, father. 
ALEXANDER: Water. Water. 
JAMIE: There's a wee drop left yet. 
(Everyone say Hi! to handsome young Fraser Hines as the McLaren drinks from the canteen and Jamie looks at the remaining piece of his bagpipes - the chanter.) 
COLIN: The battle. The battle! 
ALEXANDER: It's done. The clans are broken, shot to pieces by the English guns. Never had the chance to get to within claymore's length of them. 
COLIN: Ah, the slaughter. 
(Jamie starts to play.) 
ALEXANDER: Whist! Do you want to bring the redcoats upon us? 
JAMIE: They'll be here soon enough, have no fear. 
COLIN: The Prince? 
JAMIE: Dinna fash yourself. He was the first to leave the field. 
ALEXANDER: What's that you say about the Prince? 
COLIN: Ah stay, the pair of you. Why didn't you leave me to die on the field? 
ALEXANDER: You're the Laird himself. 
COLIN: The Laird of what? All the men of our clan are lying in the mud of the Culloden Moor. Oh, I should be with them. Oh, Kirsty, my Kirsty. 
ALEXANDER: We may not be long joining them. The English troops are butchering all their wounded and hanging all their prisoners. 
JAMIE: They canna hang us all, can they? 
ALEXANDER: They'll never hang me, piper. You may be sure of that. 
(Alexander sees movement outside) 
ALEXANDER: Whist! 
KIRSTY: The English? 
ALEXANDER: There is but three of them. 
JAMIE: They're not soldiers. 
COLIN: Our people? 
ALEXANDER: Well, I'll find out. Jamie, at the rear. You gang that way. Wait my signal.

[Near the cottage]

(Jamie and Alexander set off in opposite directions to circle round. Ben spots an abandoned field gun.) 
BEN: Hey, look! This must be where that cannon ball came from. 
DOCTOR: It's unlikely. 
BEN: What do you mean it's unlikely? 
DOCTOR: It's been spiked. 
BEN: Been what? 
DOCTOR: It's been spiked. 
(A long spike has been hammered down the barrel.) 
BEN: Well, how did you know? 
(The Doctor has spotted a bonnet with eagle feather and Jacobite cockade.) 
DOCTOR: I would like a hat like this. How do I look? 
POLLY: It's got words on it. With Charles our brave and merciful Prince Royal, we'll greatly fall or nobly save our country. 
DOCTOR: Bah. Romantic piffle. 
(The Doctor throws the bonnet to the ground.) 
ALEXANDER: You'll pick it up. 
(His claymore is at the Doctor's throat.) 
JAMIE: Careful, like. 
(Jamie has his dirk at Ben's chest. The Doctor picks up the bonnet.) 
ALEXANDER: This way with you. Quick! 
(The battle draws closer.)

[Cottage]

COLIN: We're going to awa' to the caves. 
KIRSTY: Father, you're in no fit state to travel. 
ALEXANDER: Kirsty! Get away with you. 
COLIN: Who are they? 
ALEXANDER: I know not. They're no Scot. They threw down the Prince's cockade. 
POLLY: Cockade? 
BEN: What Prince? 
DOCTOR: Prince Charles Edward. Bonnie Prince Charlie. 
ALEXANDER: You have the tongue. Aye, I thought so. English, the three of them. Camp followers to the Duke of Cumberland, come to steal from the dead. 
COLIN: Abide a moment! Do you wish to pray before you die? 
DOCTOR: Die? 
POLLY: Die for what? 
BEN: Well, you can't kill us in cold blood. 
JAMIE: Well, our bloods warm enough! Your English troopers gave no quarter to men, women and bairns. 
POLLY: Doctor, tell them who we are. 
KIRSTY: Doctor? 
ALEXANDER: Get away with you, woman. 
KIRSTY: We have need of a doctor. 
ALEXANDER: The Laird. 
COLIN: Get me a doctor. Get me a doctor. 
KIRSTY: Look, kill them after. Let them help the Laird first. 
ALEXANDER: We're not going to trust the Laird with these sassenachs, woman. 
(Ben dives forward and snatches a pistol from Colin's side.) 
KIRSTY: But if they can help him at all 
ALEXANDER: Kirsty, get away, will you. 
DOCTOR: Just think of the women. 
BEN: Right, back both of you! Or your Laird won't need a doctor. 
DOCTOR: Well done, Ben. And now, gentlemen. 
ALEXANDER: I'm warning you! 
DOCTOR: Your swords, I think. Ben, cock the pistol. 
KIRSTY: But why? Give them up! 
DOCTOR: Polly, take the swords. That's the style. Now, back against the wall, both of you. Go on! That's better. Now, I'm going to have a look at the wound. Come along, come along, let me see. Yes. We're going to need some clean water to bathe the wound. Ah. 
(The Doctor picks up a bucket and gives it to Kirsty.) 
KIRSTY: I'll not leave him. 
DOCTOR: We're not going to harm him. Polly? 
POLLY: Yes. 
DOCTOR: You go with her. 
POLLY: All right. 
DOCTOR: Off you go then. 
POLLY: Will you show me where the stream is? 
ALEXANDER: Here, Kirsty. Take the Laird's spyglass with you and watch out for these Sassenach dragoons. 
(Polly and Kirsty leave.) 
DOCTOR: You can put that away now, Ben. 
BEN: Put it away? But 
DOCTOR: Will you both give us your word that you'll not molest us? We're only trying to save your Laird from bleeding to death. 
ALEXANDER: Aye. 
JAMIE: You have our word. 
DOCTOR: Put it away, Ben. 
BEN: What, are you going to trust these blokes? 
DOCTOR: A Highlanders word is his bond. At least don't point it at me! 
(Ben tosses the pistol onto the table. Bang!) 
BEN: It just went off. 
ALEXANDER: You fool! 
JAMIE: You'll have every English soldier within miles! 
BEN: Well, what's wrong with that? 
DOCTOR: What's? You should have paid more attention to your history books, Ben. 
BEN: Ay? 
JAMIE: Redcoats! There's about six of them. 
ALEXANDER: They'll slaughter us.

[Culloden moor]

(An elegant officer, Algernon Ffinch, gazes down at the cottage.) 
SERGEANT: Sir! A rebel's been sighted, sir, at the door the cottage where the shooting seemed to come from. 
FFINCH: Good. Only one? 
SERGEANT: Only one seen, sire. There could be more. 
FFINCH: There better be. We haven't seen many, have we? 
SERGEANT: No, well, the troopers were ahead of us, sir. 
FFINCH: And done a good job. Now, I wish they'd left us some pickings. 
SERGEANT: Ah, perhaps when they got away they took their possessions with them. 
FFINCH: Let's hope so. Take a man around the rear, Sergeant. We'll out-flank them. 
SERGEANT: Sir! 
FFINCH: Tell them to shoot first and take no risks. Remember these rebels will be desperate by now. 
SERGEANT: Yes, sir! 
FFINCH: Advance in battle order. 
(His soldiers fix bayonets and advance.)

[Cottage]

JAMIE: We'll be caught like rats in a trap. Can we not run for it? 
ALEXANDER: And leave the Laird to their mercy? There is but one chance. It is but a very slim one. I will try and draw them away from this cottage. 
DOCTOR: Wait! Wait! 
(Alexander runs out to face the Redcoats.)

[Culloden moor]

ALEXANDER: Creag an tuire! 
(He is shot repeatedly.)

[Cottage]

SERGEANT: Surrender in the King's name! 
BEN: Blimey, it's good to hear a London voice again. 
SERGEANT: Silence, you rebel dog. 
BEN: Rebel? What are you talking about? I'm no rebel! Me and the Doctor here, have just arrived. 
SERGEANT: Deserter, then. You'll hang just the same. 
DOCTOR: (German accent) I'm glad you've come, Sergeant. I was waiting for an escort. 
SERGEANT: Who the devil do 
DOCTOR: Civil tongue, Sergeant! You are in charge of these men? 
FFINCH: No, I am. 
DOCTOR: A gentleman at last. Doctor von Wer, at your service. 
SERGEANT: Doctor who? 
DOCTOR: (sotto) That's what I said. 
FFINCH: One of those confounded froggies that came over with the Pretender. 
BEN: We ain't French. Are we? 
DOCTOR: German, from Hanover. Where your good King George comes from. And I speak English a good deal better than he does. 
SERGEANT: Hear that, sir. Treason! Shall we hang them now? 
FFINCH: Wait a moment. Who is that? 
JAMIE: Colin McLaren, the Laird, and I'm his piper. 
SERGEANT: Ah, they're a poor lot, sir. We'll get no pickings here. Let's hang them and have done. 
BEN: Well, a right shower you are! What have we done? Nothing! And what have you got against these two? They lost a battle, right? Well, doesn't that make them prisoners of war? 
FFINCH: Rebels are not treated as prisoners of war. Right, Sergeant, prepare to hang them. 
SERGEANT: Sir. Take him out. 
DOCTOR: Didn't I tell you I was 
SERGEANT: And you. 
BEN: But we haven't done anything! 
SERGEANT: And you. 
JAMIE: But he can't walk! 
SERGEANT: Drag him!

[Duke of Cumberland's line]

(On a supply wagon, an English solicitor called Grey has been watching the battle through a telescope. His secretary, Perkins, is setting up luncheon.) 
GREY: Perkins. Perkins! 
PERKINS: Yes, sir. 
GREY: Not a very inspiring battle, would you say, Perkins? 
PERKINS: Don't really know, sir. I've never seen one before. 
GREY: This one was over in a brief hour. Never have I seen such brave fellows so poorly led. And now, Cumberland's troops are butchering the wounded. It's such a waste of manpower. A little wine, Perkins? 
PERKINS: Oh, yes, sir. Quite ready for it, I am, sir. This sharp northern air, sir, gives one quite an appetite. 
(Two soldiers appear with a Scottish prisoner. The wounded Highlander looks longingly at the food as he is dragged past.) 
GREY: Ah, all these fine sturdy Highlanders. Used to hard work and little food. Think what a price they'd fetch in Jamaica or Barbados, Perkins. 
PERKINS: A pretty penny, no doubt, sir. No doubt at all. 
GREY: Indeed, and I'll have them, Perkins. I did not give up a thriving legal practise, just for the honour of serving King George as his Commissioner of Prisons. 
PERKINS: I thought there was more behind it, sir. 
GREY: With Mister Trask and his ship at our service, we may expect to clear some measure of profit out of this rebellion, ay Perkins? 
PERKINS: Yes, sir. 
GREY: Depending, of course, on how many of the wretched rebels we can deliver from his Majesty's over zealous soldiers. 
(Grey tastes his wine and spits it out in disgust, throwing the rest into Perkins' face.) 
GREY: The wine was corked. If you wish to remain in my service, you'll have to be more careful, won't you, Perkins? 
PERKINS: Yes, sir. My apologies, sir. It won't happen again, sir. 
GREY: I think we best be about our business, otherwise there'll be nothing but corpses left on the battlefield. And corpses are of little use to us, ay Perkins? 
PERKINS: Yes, sir. Wagon, sir? 
GREY: No, I think not. I've had enough for one day. Come, Perkins, we'll walk. 
PERKINS: Yes, sir. 
(Grey strides off, leaving Perkins to cope with the hamper.) 
GREY: Perkins. 
PERKINS: Yes, sir? 
(Perkins takes a mouthful of wine.) 
GREY: Perkins!

[Culloden moor]

(Polly and Kirsty are returning to the cottage with the water. At the top of the hill they spot the soldiers outside the cottage.) 
KIRSTY: Down! 
POLLY: Oh, you've spilt the water. Who are those men? 
KIRSTY: Don't pretend you can't recognise English Redcoats when you see them, even at this distance. 
POLLY: English? Well, that's all right, then. We're safe. 
KIRSTY: Do you want to get us both killed? Tortured? Look, they're going to hang our men. 
(Polly takes the telescope to see nooses being hung over the branch of an oak tree.) 
POLLY: You're right. It's horrible. They've got to be stopped. 
KIRSTY: How? 
POLLY: Well, there must be something we can do? 
KIRSTY: We can but mourn. 
POLLY: Crying's no good. Have you still got breath to run. Come on. We're going to create a diversion. 
(Polly throws a stone in the direction of the cottage.)

[Outside the cottage]

FFINCH: What was that? 
(A second stone hits a soldier.) 
SERGEANT: Look, sir, over there, on that hill. 
FFINCH: Looks like a wench. Stab me, there's another one. 
SERGEANT: Yeah, puts me in mind of what Sergeant King of the Dragoons said, sir. 
FFINCH: What? 
SERGEANT: Well, the Dragoons have got orders to stop every woman. Not that they need them, mind. 
FFINCH: Get to the point, Sergeant. 
SERGEANT: Well, they've heard that the Prince is trying to escape disguised as a woman. Shall I go after them, sir? 
FFINCH: No, I'll go. You two men, come with me. 
SERGEANT: Yeah, but I

[Culloden moor]

POLLY: This is our chance. The officer's coming after us. They can't hang them with the officer away. Let's go. 
KIRSTY: It'll do no good. 
POLLY: Besides which, you must know this place better than they do. 
KIRSTY: There's a high track. 
POLLY: And we're younger than they are. They'll never catch us. Come on. 
KIRSTY: But, look 
POLLY: Leave that. 
(Kirsty leaves the bucket. After a short while Polly has to abandon her shoes and go barefoot to keep up with Kirsty. The soldiers start to fall behind.)

[Outside the Cottage]

(The Doctor, Ben, Jamie and Colin all have nooses around their necks.) 
DOCTOR: What a great devotion to duty your Lieutenant shows, Sergeant. 
SERGEANT: Devotion to duty. Devotion to thirty thousand pound reward, that's all. 
DOCTOR: You think he will catch them? 
SERGEANT: That young whelp? Couldn't catch his own grandmother. 
DOCTOR: Disrespect to your superior officer, Sergeant? I could report you. 
SERGEANT: You could, but you won't. 
DOCTOR: Ah, but at a price, Sergeant. 
SERGEANT: You won't, cause you won't be here when he gets back. All right you scum, proceed with the hanging. 
BEN: Well, you can't hang us with the officer away. 
SERGEANT: Why do you think he went away? Got a delicate stomach, he has. Always leaves the dirty stuff to me. Right! Get them up! 
(The prisoners are forced to stand on a bench.) 
SERGEANT: Take the strain! Stand by! 
(A drum roll starts.) 
GREY: Halt! 
SERGEANT: What do you want? 
GREY: One moment! 
SERGEANT: Who the devil are you? 
GREY: Perkins. 
PERKINS: Solicitor Grey, Lincolns Inn Fields. His Majesty's Commissioner for the disposal of rebel prisoners. 
GREY: There's a fine sturdy young man. Take the nooses off them. Set that young man down. 
PERKINS: Set him down. 
SERGEANT: I don't care who you are. You've got no charge over my men. 
GREY: Can you not read, Sergeant? I have charge over all rebel prisoners. 
PERKINS: Of course he has. Appointed by the Chief Justice of England. All prisoners. 
SERGEANT: Not these. 
GREY: Perkins. 
(Perkins searches in his pocket.) 
GREY: The other pocket, I think. 
(Perkins produces some silver coins.) 
GREY: I admit your prior claim, Sergeant, but I think you are a reasonable man. 
(The payment is refused.) 
GREY: Continue, Perkins. Continue, I said. Of course, I regret any inconvenience encountered by yourself and these fine fellows of yours. 
SERGEANT: All right, you heard what the Commissioner said. Nooses off. Get him down. 
BEN: Oh, thanks, sir. 
GREY: A trifle, I assure you. Strong ruffians like you and this other young rebel here, are needed in his Majesty's service. 
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. 
(Grey gestures to the Doctor and Colin.) 
GREY: You can despatch this one, Sergeant, and this strange looking scoundrel. 
DOCTOR: Article Seventeen, Aliens Act, 1730. 
GREY: What? 
DOCTOR: You are gentlemen of the law? 
PERKINS: How dare you speak to Mister Grey like that. 
GREY: I am a lawyer, yes. 
DOCTOR: Then you are doubtless familiar with Article Seventeen. You cannot hang a citizen of a foreign power, without first informing his ambassador. 
PERKINS: Article Seventeen, Aliens Act? 
GREY: Who is this extraordinary rogue? 
SERGEANT: He says he's a frog doctor, sir. 
DOCTOR: German. And I know more about the English law than you do, it seems. 
SERGEANT: I'm the only law what matters to you right now, matey. And if this gentleman don't want you, you hang. 
GREY: No, wait. You show a touching faith in his Majesty's justice, sir. A doctor, eh? We need doctors where you're going. Send him along with the other prisoners to Inverness. 
JAMIE: The Laird goes too or you can hang me with him. I'll not go with ye. 
COLIN: No, go, Jamie, go. 
SERGEANT: We'll see about that. 
GREY: Sergeant! What do you think, Doctor? Can this man be healed of his wound? 
DOCTOR: With proper care, yes. 
GREY: Whether he'll get that where he is going is very doubtful. But I'll leave him in your care. Take him away, Sergeant. 
SERGEANT: Sir! 'Shun! You men escort these gentlemen and these prisoners to Inverness. I'll wait here for the Lieutenant. Come on, out. Get him down. 
DOCTOR: What will happen to us? 
GREY: First you go to Inverness, and then perhaps a sea voyage? 
SERGEANT: Do you good, rogue. Come on. 
GREY: Just in time, Perkins. Just in time.

[Cave]

KIRSTY: This is the cave. They'll not find us here. 
(A narrow fissure widens out into a large cave.) 
POLLY: You don't live here, do you? 
KIRSTY: Oh, no. The family use it as a hide out after a cattle raid. 
POLLY: A cattle raid? You mean you rob people? 
KIRSTY: No! We only take from those who steal from us. 
POLLY: Oh, it's dark. 
KIRSTY: Ah, there we are. 
POLLY: That's a funny kind of match. 
KIRSTY: What? 
POLLY: Match. Oh, it doesn't matter. 
KIRSTY: Now, we keep a supply of food here. Oh no, there's only one wheat biscuit. 
POLLY: When was it left here? 
KIRSTY: Well, about three months ago. 
POLLY: Oh, it's a dog biscuit. 
KIRSTY: Biscuits are not baked for dogs. But please do begin. 
POLLY: Oh, no, no, you start. I don't want to lose all my fillings. Teeth. Doesn't matter. You start. I'm not hungry, really. Got to make a plan. We saw them being marched away. Now where would they be taking them? 
KIRSTY: Inverness gaol. 
POLLY: Oh, look, don't start crying again. If they've taken them to gaol, then we've got to get them out. Have you got any money? 
KIRSTY: But what would we need money for? 
POLLY: Well, for food, of course. That biscuit isn't going to last very long. And for bribing guards with. What have we got we can sell? 
(Polly looks at her bracelet.) 
POLLY: This won't fetch much, but at least its a start. 
KIRSTY: Why should you help us? You're English. 
POLLY: They've got my friends too, remember? Yes, and I must get some proper clothes. 
KIRSTY: Aye, why do you wear the short skirts of a bairn? You're a grown woman. 
POLLY: Well, it would take too long to explain. 
(Polly notices a large ring on Kirsty's finger.) 
POLLY: Hey, that ring. It's gold. Look, you've got to trust me. 
KIRSTY: It doesn't belong to me. It's my father's. 
POLLY: Well, let me just look at it. Come on, now. I just want to look at it, that's all. It's beautiful. We should get a lot for that. 
KIRSTY: We're not going to sell it! 
POLLY: Not even to save your father's life? 
KIRSTY: He wouldn't thank me. 
POLLY: Oh, you're hopeless. Why not, for goodness sake? 
KIRSTY: He entrusted it to me before the battle. He would kill me if I ever parted with it. 
POLLY: I don't understand you people. Come on, give it to me. 
KIRSTY: No. 
POLLY: Look, give it to me! It's the. Please yourself! You're just a stupid peasant. I'm off to help my friends. You can stay here and guard your precious ring. 
KIRSTY: Look, mind your step. It'll be dark soon. 
POLLY [OC]: Watch out for yourself. 
KIRSTY: You'll get lost.

[Culloden moor]

(Polly walks along a rough track. An owl hoots. Suddenly the ground gives way under her feet and she falls. Polly screams. Winded but unhurt, Polly realises she has fallen into an animal trap. She tries to scramble out, as a hand clutching a dagger appears over her head. She screams again.)

Episode Two

[Animal trap]

POLLY: Don't. 
KIRSTY: Oh, it's yourself. 
POLLY: You! Of course it's myself. Who did you think it was? 
KIRSTY: I thought a Redcoat had fallen into the animal trap. 
POLLY: Well, by the look on your face I'm glad it wasn't. Come on, help me out of here. 
KIRSTY: Well, look, give me your hand then. 
POLLY: Wait a minute, I can't 
KIRSTY: Well, come on. 
POLLY: Pull! 
KIRSTY: I'm pulling! 
(Kirsty falls into the pit as well.) 
POLLY: Are you hurt? 
KIRSTY: Oh, no. Just a wee bruise or two and a lot of dirt. Now we're both trapped. 
POLLY: No we're not! Even your dour Scots lassies must have played piggy-back. 
KIRSTY: What? I don't understand. 
POLLY: Well, you bend down and I climb on top of you and scramble up. Look, I'll show you. 
KIRSTY: What? 
POLLY: Bend down here a minute. All right. 
KIRSTY: Oh! 
POLLY: You okay? 
KIRSTY: Quick, will ye! You're no light weight. Oh, go on. Hurry! Come on. 
POLLY: Shh! There's a light. Soldiers. 
KIRSTY: Redcoats. Oh, we're cornered. 
POLLY: No, we're not. They'll soon pass. 
(They both crouch down as Ffinch and his men approach.)

[Culloden moor]

FFINCH: (to the other soldiers) Halt! You dolt. Couldn't catch a couple of wenches, could you? Call yourselves soldiers? The terror of the Highlands? You wouldn't frighten an one-armed dairy maid. Well, I've done enough walking for one day. Go and fetch my horse. If you're not back within one hour, three hundred lashes apiece. Imbeciles! Give the lantern to me. I don't want to be left here in the dark. Right then, march! 
(The soldiers leave.)

[Animal trap]

KIRSTY: He's staying there. 
POLLY: Oh, not again. Didn't the women of your age do anything but cry? 
KIRSTY: What? 
POLLY: It doesn't matter. Listen, I've got an idea. Since our officer has so obligingly parked himself outside our pit, we'll lure him in to join us. 
KIRSTY: Oh, glory. 
POLLY: We'll be able to deal with him. Now, this is what we are going to do.

[Culloden moor]

(Ffinch has started eating when an owl hoots.) 
FFINCH: What's that? 
(He raises the lantern. Another woo sound and he draws his sword, moving towards the trap. More noises and then he falls in.)

[Animal trap]

KIRSTY: Move and I'll blow your brains out. 
POLLY: She will too, so you better keep still. I'm going to take the sash for his feet and you take the belt for his wrists. 
FFINCH: Outrageous! Do you know that for assaulting a King's Officer you could 
POLLY: I know. But you're not in charge now. The next thing is his pockets. 
KIRSTY: Ach, no! 
POLLY: Look, he's probably got money and we need it. 
FFINCH: You can't mean to rob me. 
KIRSTY: Look, you and your kind have robbed our glens. Look, he's got food. Chicken and bread. 
POLLY: Great! Now, my gallant officer. 
FFINCH: I've done you no harm. 
KIRSTY: 'Tis no thanks to you that my father and Jamie weren't hanged. They're probably rotting in gaol in Inverness by now.

[Gaol]

(Sounds of coughing in the dungeon that serves as Inverness gaol.) 
BEN: Look after him, mate. He'll be all right. Okay, mate, okay. Take it easy, take it easy. Sit down. 
(Their cell is circular, waterlogged and moss-lined.) 
BEN: A right rat hole this is, isn't it? 
JAMIE: Oh, King George has worse than this, never fear. 
BEN: Yeah, well, I'm glad Polly's out of it. Why did we ever get mixed up in this, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I'm glad we did. I'm just beginning to enjoy myself. Down with King George! 
(Cheers.) 
SENTRY: Silence, you Jacobite pigs. You don't want to feel this bayonet. 
JAMIE: Oh, enjoy yourselves. So you are for the Prince after all? 
DOCTOR: No, not really. I just like hearing the echo, that's all. Let's have a look at his wound, shall we? 
JAMIE: Would you not be letting him now? 
DOCTOR: With care that'll heal. 
JAMIE: Ach, here's you saying you're a doctor, you've not even bled him yet. 
BEN: What's he on about? 
DOCTOR: Blood letting. 
BEN: Yeah, but that's stupid. 
JAMIE: It's the only way of curing the sick. 
BEN: Killing him, more like. He's lost enough blood already. 
DOCTOR: Oh, Isis and Osiris, is it meet? Aquarius, Aries, Taurus. 
JAMIE: Oh, aye. 
BEN: (Now what are you mumbling about? 
JAMIE: Whist, man. 
DOCTOR: Gemini and Taurus. When was the Laird born? 
JAMIE: In the fifth month. 
DOCTOR: That's what I thought. Now, blood letting must wait until Taurus is in the ascendant. So it is willed. 
BEN: You don't believe all that codswallop, do you? 
DOCTOR: Of course I do. So does he. He's never heard of germs. 
JAMIE: What was that word? 
DOCTOR: It's a secret word. 
BEN: Yeah, germs, they're all around us. 
DOCTOR: Used by German doctors. 
JAMIE: Oh, Ger-man. Germs. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Have you got a handkerchief, Ben? 
BEN: Yeah, here you are. 
DOCTOR: Good. 
JAMIE: Ach, that wee lassies kerchief? Here, Doctor, use mine. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. Just a fresh dressing. 
(As the Doctor binds Colin's wound he notices an embroidered silk cloth under his plaid.) 
DOCTOR: Hello, what's this? 
JAMIE: Prince Charlie's personal standard. 
BEN: What's he doing with it? 
JAMIE: Protecting it. Now put it back, will ye. If a sentry saw it 
DOCTOR: No, wait. 
The Doctor wraps it around his body under his coat.) 
JAMIE: What are you doing? 
DOCTOR: What chance do you think he has of evading the gallows with this on him? 
JAMIE: Well 
DOCTOR: Besides, it's really rather nice and warm. Let's have a tune to cheer us all up. 
(The Doctor produces his recorder.) 
BEN: Yeah, I didn't think we'd heard the last of that. 
SENTRY: Silence! 
JAMIE: Whist, man! 
DOCTOR: Well, you're a loyal Jacobite, aren't you? This is your tune. Come on, everybody, join in. 
SENTRY: Silence, I say! I warned you rebels once! Now we'll see what a touch of the bayonet will do. Now then!
BEN: The guard is coming down now. 
SENTRY: You! 
DOCTOR: (German) Thank heavens. Did you hear that tune? 
SENTRY: Heard a rebel dirge. 
DOCTOR: They were singing it to drive me out of my mind, as I'm a loyal subject to King George the Second! 
SENTRY: Now what's that got to do with me? 
DOCTOR: They know of a plot to murder your general, the Duke of Cumberland. 
JAMIE: What? 
BEN: Oh, come off it, Doctor. 
JAMIE: I knew he wasne one of us. 
DOCTOR: Take me to Solicitor Grey. Perhaps we're in time to prevent it. 
SENTRY: Why didn't you speak about this before? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's only just discovered. That rogue is party to it! 
(The prisoners shout and the guards take the Doctor away.) 
BEN: Well done, mate. 
JAMIE: What do you mean? Why don't you go and join your friend? 
BEN: Oh, calm down. Can't you see it was all a fiddle? 
JAMIE: Fiddle? 
BEN: Well, a trick, a ruse to get out of here. 
JAMIE: I don't understand you. 
BEN: Oh, blimey, look. Outside he's got a chance to get away and rescue us. What chance do you think he's got paddling round in here? 
JAMIE: Aye, nevertheless, I'm still worried. 
BEN: Now don't you worry about him, mate, worry about us. See that line? Well, that's where the water level comes up to. And tonight is not my bath night.

[Animal trap]

POLLY: seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty. Twenty guineas. How far do you think it will get us? 
KIRSTY: I've never seen so much money in all my days. 
FFINCH: You'll both hang for this, you know. 
POLLY: You're very fond of hanging, aren't you, Mister. Hey, what's your name? 
FFINCH: I refuse to tell you. 
POLLY: Oh, we're very brave all of a sudden. Watch him, Kirsty. He must have some form of. Ah-ha, yes. Algernon Thomas Alfred Ffinch. Two 'f's! Lieutenant in the Honourable Colonel Atwood's Rifles. So, I bet the Colonel would be highly interested to hear how his Lieutenant F-finch was captured by two girls. 
FFINCH: You would not tell. 
POLLY: Oh, wouldn't we? Give me the knife, Kirsty. 
FFINCH: What are you going to do? 
POLLY: Never fear, Algernon Thomas F-finch. We're just after a small souvenir, that's all. There we are. This piece of hair and this disc will be proof enough in case the Colonel doesn't believe us. 
KIRSTY: But, but why? 
POLLY: We need an ally in the enemy camp and I think we've found one. Right, Algernon? 
FFINCH: It's sheer blackmail. 
POLLY: Right again. Come on, Kirsty, let's go before this officer's soldiers get back. Bye bye, Algy dear. We'll be seeing you in Inverness. Come on, Kirsty. Up you go. All right? 
KIRSTY: Oh no. I

[Inverness - Sea Eagle inn]

(The lawyers meet with a sea captain in private.) 
TRASK: Well, lawyer, my old cattle boat's ready for its livestock. Belay there! What in thunder are you laughing at? 
GREY: It will be no laughing matter for any of us if we are caught, I can assure you. That is why we must begin loading the prisoners tonight. 
TRASK: Tonight? 
GREY: Before the judges are ready to try the rebels, we'll have them all safely on plantations. 
TRASK: Arr. A Highlander will do twice the work of one of your black slaves. 
PERKINS: At least twice. 
TRASK: Who asked for your opinion? 
GREY: Silence, Captain. I will not have my clerk bullied. I have enough evidence on you to send you to the gallows ten times over, and don't you forget it. 
(A knock on the door.) 
GREY: Come in! Well? 
SENTRY: One of the prisoners, sir. He insists on seeing you. Says he has some important information about a plot against the Duke's life, sir. 
GREY: Why come to me? 
SENTRY: Says he won't speak to no one else but you, sir. 
GREY: Which prisoner is it? 
SENTRY: The German doctor, sir. 
GREY: Ah, interesting. Bring him in at once. 
SENTRY: Sir. 
GREY: Well man, what are you waiting? Perkins. 
(Perkins reluctantly hands a shilling to the sentry, who then leaves.) 
GREY: Now, gentlemen, I suggest you start loading the prisoners at once. Here is your warrant. And to avoid comment, you'd better take them the back way. 
SENTRY: The prisoner, sir. 
GREY: Perkins. Trask. 
(Trask and Perkins leave past the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: Auf Wiedersehen. 
TRASK: Arr. 
(Grey takes a flintlock pistol from the case on his desk and puts it on the table.) 
GREY: You may go. 
SENTRY: Sir. 
(The sentry leaves.) 
GREY: Now, Doctor, your story. I hope it is an entertaining one. It has cost me a silver shilling. Very well then, what is the nature of this plot? 
DOCTOR: There is no plot. 
GREY: Have a care, Doctor. You waste my time at your peril. 
DOCTOR: Would the chance to lay your hands on 15,000 pounds be a waste of your time? 
GREY: What would a vagabond like you know of such a sum, pray? 
DOCTOR: The personal standard of Prince Charles Edward. 
GREY: Indeed. 
DOCTOR: Whoever was entrusted with this standard stood closest to the councils of the Prince, you would agree? He would also know where the Prince was most likely to run to. 
GREY: Which prisoner carried this standard? 
DOCTOR: That must remain my secret for the time being. 
GREY: There are ways to force your tongue. 
DOCTOR: But why employ them, since we are both on the same side? The 30,000 pounds reward for the capture of the Prince is surely enough to satisfy both of us. 
GREY: Ah, you have some fresh information as to his whereabouts? 
DOCTOR: I am on the track of some, but I need a free hand. 
(Throwing the flag over Grey's head, the Doctor snatches the pistol.) 
DOCTOR: Don't cry out. I'm not very expert with these things and it just might go off in your face. Turn around and put your hands behind you. 
GREY: You'll pay for this. 
DOCTOR: Just keep very still. 
(The Doctor uses Grey's own belt to tie his hands.) 
DOCTOR: There, now turn around. Why, great heavens, man, your throat. 
GREY: What? 
DOCTOR: It's so swollen. Does it hurt you? 
GREY: No, of course not. 
DOCTOR: Say ahh. 
GREY: What? 
DOCTOR: Ahh. 
GREY: Ahh. Mphf! 
(The Doctor stuffs a handkerchief into Grey's mouth.) 
DOCTOR: I've never seen a silent lawyer before. 
(A knock at the door.) 
DOCTOR: Would you mind just waiting in here? Another patient, you understand. 
(The Doctor shoves Grey into a cupboard then sits at the solicitor's desk.) 
DOCTOR: Enter. 
PERKINS: Oh, er, pardon, I thought that 
DOCTOR: You thought what? 
PERKINS: The, the Solicitor? 
DOCTOR: Your master's a very sick man. He's gone to lie down. It lucky for him I was called in time. Well, great heavens, man. Your eyes! 
PERKINS: What? 
DOCTOR: Your eyes. Come over here to the light. 
(Perkins sits in the chair and the Doctor leans over him, bringing out a magnifying glass to examine his eyes.) 
Your eyes, man. You suffer from headaches? 
PERKINS: No, I don't. 
(The Doctor bangs Perkins' head on the desk.) 
DOCTOR: No headaches? 
PERKINS: Well, er. Ow! 
(Another thump.) 
DOCTOR: Oh dear. You call me a liar? 
PERKINS: Well, no, no, no, no. Me head does ache. 
DOCTOR: Of course it does, what did you expect? Your eyes. 
PERKINS: Me eyes? What did you find? 
DOCTOR: Print blindness. You read too much. 
PERKINS: Well, 'tis true, I'm a clerk. What must I do? 
DOCTOR: You must rest them for at least an hour. 
PERKINS: But, I 
DOCTOR: That is my prescription. Ignore it at your peril. Now, lie down on the table. That's right. And put this over your eyes and rest them for at least an hour. 
(A thumping sound comes from the cupboard.) 
PERKINS: What's that knocking? 
DOCTOR: Knocking? It's not knocking, it's in your mind. In your eyes. Now rest your eyes and the knocking will grow fainter, and fainter, and fainter. One hour, remember. 
PERKINS: One hour, Doctor. One hour. 
(The Doctor blows him a kiss and leaves.)

[Animal trap]

SERGEANT [OC]: Sir? 
FFINCH: Sergeant! 
SERGEANT [OC]: Where are you sir? I can't quite see you. 
FFINCH: I'm down here, man! 
SERGEANT: Oh, there you are, sir. 
FFINCH: What took you so long, you jackanapes? 
SERGEANT: Well, we made the best time we could in the dark, sir, but it's hard to see our way, you see? 
FFINCH: Well, don't just stand there. Get me out of this infernal hole. 
SERGEANT: All right, you two, I'll handle this. You go and stand guard by the Lieutenant's horse. Come on. 
FFINCH: Well, come on, man. Help me out! 
SERGEANT: Well, it's er, it's very deep, sir. 
FFINCH: Get me out at once or I'll order you five hundred lashes apiece! 
SERGEANT: Oh, don't misunderstand me, sir. I'm willing enough to try, but you see, er, we're not used to pulling officers out of pits. 
FFINCH: Confound it, man, what are you jabbering about? 
SERGEANT: Well, I mean to say, sir, you see, er, officers don't usually fall into pits. 
FFINCH: You'll regret this, Sergeant. 
SERGEANT: Ah, it isn't me, sir. You see, it's the men I'm thinking about. I mean, they're not used to it, like. I mean, they're going to be very slow, sir. And they're going to be very dry. 
FFINCH: I see! Well, here's some money to drink with and I hope it chokes you! 
(Then he remembers the girls have taken all his money.) 
FFINCH: You'll, er, get it when we return to Inverness. Well, for the last time, man, get me out of here.

[Inverness - Sea Eagle inn]

TRASK: We've started shipping them across. What in thunder? 
PERKINS: I'm resting me eyes. 
TRASK: Damn your eyes. Where's your master? 
PERKINS: The Doctor says he must rest too. 
TRASK: Rest? 
(Trask opens the cupboard to reveal Grey.) 
TRASK: Now what have we here then? A pretty sight you look, lawyer. And what might this be a cure for, Saint Vitus's Dance? 
GREY: Oh, release me you fool. You let him escape. 
PERKINS: Well, I didn't know. It's me head. 
GREY: One more such folly, t'will need no further cures. 
TRASK: The Prince's standard. 
GREY: Aye, he used that to trick me with, but he won't get far. Perkins, summon the watch! And you, get those prisoners aboard before the soldiers get here. 
TRASK: Arr.

[Inn scullery]

(Perkins runs past the scullery where a maid is washing dishes and humming to herself.) 
MAN [OC]: Mollie, where are ye? 
MOLLIE: All richt, all richt. 
MAN [OC]: Mollie! 
MOLLIE: Whist your noise, I'm coming. 
(Throwing off her apron, Mollie leaves. The Doctor comes out of hiding. A washing line stretches along one wall hung with gowns, petticoats and aprons. There is a large rough table with platters of bread and meat and a flagon of wine. The Doctor starts towards the food, then changes his mind. He hears footsteps outside.) 
MAN [OC]: There must be some grub around here somewhere. 
(The Doctor hides behind the clothesline as two Redcoats enter and sit at the table.)

[Gaol]

TRASK: That's two of them, and room for one more. Here! 
SENTRY: All right you, come on. He's done for. 
TRASK: The next one, you swab. 
SENTRY: You. You'll do. Out with the others. Come on, all three of you. Outside! Move! 
(The other prisoners shout as Jamie, Colin and Ben are dragged from the cell and out of the gaol.)

[Inverness - Sea Eagle inn corridor]

SENTRY: Now, look lively! 
(The prisoners are pushed along a corridor, past an old woman struggling with a large pot. Ben nearly knocks her over.) 
BEN: Sorry. 
TRASK: Watch your feet, you swab. Out of the way, you. Right, open up. 
(A sentry unlocks a door and Trask motions the prisoners into a bare wooden room.) 
SENTRY: Come on through. Get a move on, now. Step lively.

[Inverness - Sea Eagle room]

JAMIE: Where's your friend? 
BEN: Polly? I don't know. Safe, I hope. 
JAMIE: And Kirsty, too. They're well out of it. But I mean the Doctor. 
BEN: I dunno. He'll be here though, don't worry. 
JAMIE: Yeah, in a wee moment it'll just be too late. 
TRASK: Silence, you two! Unless ye wants a taste of this! Right, you're all going down there. Right, Pat lad, down he goes. 
(Wooden steps lead down through a trap door to a small landing stage where a rowing boat is moored. Jamie and Ben help Colin clamber down.)

[Rowing boat]

(A small group of prisoners are huddled at the stern of the boat, with two of Trask's men at the oars.) 
SENTRY: Right, Mister Trask, that's the lot. 
BEN: Well, where are you taking us? 
TRASK: You'll find out soon enough. 
JAMIE: You've not a mind to drown us, have you? 
TRASK: Ha! Wouldn't pollute the firth with ye. Get in the boat. 
BEN: Quick, we can make a break for it and swim. 
JAMIE: I can't swim. 
BEN: Now you tell me. 
TRASK: In the boat! 
(Ben gets into the boat with Jamie and Colin. The prisoners are manacled,) 
TRASK: Right. Off.

[Inverness - Sea Eagle room]

(The trap door is closed by the soldiers. The old woman is the Doctor in disguise and 'she' appears in the doorway.) 
SENTRY: All right, Fred. Come on, let's move. 
DOCTOR: But, officer 
SENTRY: Go away, will you. 
DOCTOR: I've bought a wee drop of broth for Mister Trask. 
SENTRY: Well, he's not here, miss. He's gone. He's not here. 
DOCTOR: Will you have it officer? It's a pity to waste a nice hot broth. Do you good. 
SENTRY: Oh, all right, I'll have it. It's a cold night outside anyway. What are you looking at? There's not enough here for two. Go on, get back to your post! Go! Move! 
(He sends out the soldiers and the old woman, then goes in the opposite direction. The Doctor reappears, delighted that the door has not been locked. He goes back in and opens the trap door.)

[Ship Annabelle]

(On the deck is a man tied hand and foot, supported by two sailors.) 
TRASK: Belay there, you swabs! In case you're thinking of escaping, there's Jim Hughes for you. He didn't find it an happy ship, so I'll find him another berth where he'll be happy! 
(The bound man is thrown over board, sinking instantly.) 
TRASK: Once aboard the Annabelle, that's the only way you'll get off her. Straight downwards! Arr.

Episode Three

[Annabelle's hold]

(The hold is packed full of captured Highlanders huddled together in the half-light. Ben, Jamie and Colin are forced down the ladder.) 
TRASK: Get in there! 
BEN: But there's no room. 
TRASK: Room enough for rebels. Get stored below. 
BEN: What have you got down here, stinking fish? 
TRASK: That's exactly what it is, stinking fish. 
JAMIE: Well, I'm not going. 
TRASK: Yes you are, you scurvy swab. Another word out of you and I'll be down here with my cutlass. You'll learn who's master here. 
(There's lots of coughing from the residents.) 
BEN: Oh, you can hardly breathe. 
COLIN: At least we're alive. 
JAMIE: Are you feeling better, sir? 
COLIN: Greatly recovered, thank you, Jamie. My fever's going. 
JAMIE: Aye, it'll be no better for being cooped up in this hell hole. 
BEN: Yeah, for how long though? And where are they sending us? 
COLIN: Who kens. 
BEN: What? 
JAMIE: Who knows? 
BEN: Well, someone here might. Hey mate, got any idea where they're sending us? 
WILLY: Beware. They're spies. 
BEN: What? 
WILLY: This man's an Englishman. One more blow we can strike for Scotland. 
BEN: Ay? What are you talking about? 
WILLY: One more piece of vermin to be stamped out. 
BEN: What are you going to do? 
WILLY: Put the foot into him and tramp his English bones into the deck. Back! Back! I discovered him. The first blow will be mine. 
COLIN: Will MacKay would never strike a friend of the Prince. 
WILLY: I know that voice. 
COLIN: Ye havna been away so long you don't recognise me. 
WILLY: Ach, man, it's yourself. Colin McLaren. 
COLIN: And Jamie, son of Donald McCrimmon. A piper, like his father and his father's father. 
JAMIE: With no pipes though, just my chanter. 
WILLY: Ah, wee Jimmy. But this Englishman, he is a friend to our Prince? 
COLIN: He is a friend of mine. He helped bring me here, weak but alive. 
WILLY: Ach well now, I crave your pardon. A friend of the McLaren's is a friend of mine. 
BEN: Well thanks, I'm glad to hear it. 
WILLY: Then how came he here with you? 
JAMIE: Who, Ben? He's a deserting English sailor. So we take him back home. 
WILLY: A sailor. I'm a man of the sea myself. The master of this very vessel. 
BEN: If you're the skipper here, what's that Trask geezer doing on the bridge? 
WILLY: That shark was my mate. I was running arms from France past the blockade. Trask betrayed me. The Navy boarded the Annabelle and now he's sailing the ship for King George! 
BEN: Oh yeah? 
WILLY: You doubt my word? 
BEN: Oh no, skipper, just the bit about working for King George. 
WILLY: What do you mean? 
BEN: Well, we're not exactly being treated like prisoners of war, now are we? Doesn't it occur to you that this Trask could be using this vessel without the knowledge of his King and Sovereign in order to work some big fiddle on his own account? 
WILLY: Fiddle? 
BEN: Look, mate, he is going to sell us like the stinking fish he thinks we are. Slave labour, that's what we're going to be, slave labour!

[Barn]

(On the outskirts of Inverness, Polly is waiting for Kirsty. There is a noise outside, so she looks out to see an old tinker passing by, leading a donkey laden with pots and pans. Polly plays with the dirk Kirsty has left her, stabbing at the air, but ends up dropping it. Another noise makes Polly turn around.) 
POLLY: Kirsty! You gave me such a fright. 
KIRSTY: I'm not used to fetching and carrying, you know. We used to have our own servants. 
POLLY: That's obvious. Did you get everything? 
KIRSTY: Aye, the clothes for you and trays and oranges. But, what so we have to spend our money on oranges for? 
POLLY: You'll see. Hey, these are great. Last time we went back to the past I had to wear boy's clothes all the time. 
KIRSTY: What? 
POLLY: Now then. How do I look? 
KIRSTY: Bonnie enough. 
POLLY: Okay, the next thing is the oranges. In the trays. 
KIRSTY: You're not going to have us selling oranges, are ye? 
POLLY: What? I haven't got it wrong, have I? You do have orange sellers, don't you? I mean Nell Gwyn and all that? 
KIRSTY: Nell Gwyn? Well, of course there are orange sellers in Scotland. But they're mostly coarse common girls. 
POLLY: The sort that hang around soldiers. 
KIRSTY: Yes. 
POLLY: Right, then we're going to be orange sellers. 
KIRSTY: What? 
POLLY: Well look, how else can we find out where they've taken the Doctor and your father? 
KIRSTY: But if they catch us. 
POLLY: We still have a friend. 
KIRSTY: Who? 
POLLY: Algernon F-finch. Always assuming he's got out of that terrible pit.

[Inverness - Sea Eagle dining room]

(The room is full. A group of soldiers are playing cards. The Doctor is still disguised as an old woman. When Ffinch enters, all the soldiers stand to attention.) 
FFINCH: Sit down. Sit down. Wench! Get me some wine. Come on, hurry up, woman. At last. Be off with you. I'll pay later. That's better. That's better. 
(Sergeant Clegg arrives with two orange sellers.) 
SERGEANT: All right, you two, in here and see the officer. Go on, in you go. Get in there. 
KIRSTY: Put your hands off me or I'll scalp the hide off ye! 
POLLY: Kirsty, be quiet! 
KIRSTY: I'm not having a great ugly Englishman laying hands on me! Filthy. 
POLLY: Keep quiet, Kirsty, you'll give away the game. 
SERGEANT: Over here, both of you. 
KIRSTY: Will you stop that! Stop it! You'll pay for this. 
SERGEANT: All right you scum, get back! Get out or you'll be flayed alive. Go on. 
KIRSTY: Oh, you're so brave, Sergeant. 
SERGEANT: Very funny. Over there. 
POLLY: Algy. Algernon. 
FFINCH: What? 
POLLY: Algernon. Hey, wake up. Wake up, Algy. 
FFINCH: Oh no! 
SERGEANT: These two look like the rebels we were searching for yesterday, sir. 
POLLY: What a nasty man. Tell him we're not, Algy, dear. 
FFINCH: Oh, just a minute. 
KIRSTY: Aye, we're old friends. 
SERGEANT: I can see that. 
FFINCH: Well, that's all, Sergeant. Be about your business. 
SERGEANT: Sir. All right, you scum, out of it! The King doesn't pay you to lay around here all day. Go on, out, all of you. The last one out gets five hundred lashes. Now go on, beat it! Out! 
(Clegg follows the soldiers out into the street.) 
FFINCH: This is really too much. 
POLLY: Oh, Algy, we thought you'd be flattered. We turned to you for help immediately, didn't we Kirsty? 
KIRSTY: Just the sort of man two defenceless girls would turn to. 
FFINCH: I'll have you thrown in prison. 
POLLY: Alfred Algernon Thomas 
FFINCH: Quiet. What more do you want from me? Stab me, you've taken all my money. I haven't even the price of a glass of wine left on me. 
POLLY: I don't suppose the Doctor and the others have a glass of water to drink, never mind wine. Now, where are they? 
FFINCH: How should I know? In prison, I expect, where they belong. 
KIRSTY: They're not, we've checked. Now where are they? 
FFINCH: I don't know. I just round them up. You'll have to ask Solicitor Grey. He's in charge of prisoners, not me. 
POLLY: Where is he? 
FFINCH: He's got a room somewhere near here. Can I go? Dash it, I haven't had a wink of sleep yet. 
POLLY: Oh, you poor thing. Go on. But be careful. Not a word to anyone. 
(The Doctor tries to attract Polly's attention as Ffinch leaves, meeting Perkins coming in.) 
FFINCH: Two wenches there to see the Solicitor. 
(Perkins bumps into the Doctor.) 
PERKINS: Oh, I beg your pardon, madam. Kindly sit down here. Cedric Perkins, Solicitor's Clerk, ladies, at your service. What can I do for you? 
POLLY: Where is the Solicitor? 
PERKINS: Seeing to his duties. Giving some rebel prisoners the choice between life and death.

[Annabelle's hold]

TRASK: Silence there, you bilge rats! And quiet! Pipe down there. Quiet. The Solicitor hath news for ye. 
GREY: Rebels, your attention. A mark of clemency from his most gracious Majesty King George. 
TRASK: Get down! Get down! 
GREY: This clemency can be withdrawn, so hark ye. 
WILLY: We're harking to ye. 
GREY: It has pleased his Majesty to declare, that whereas there are a great many of his rebellious subjects in gaol, a speedy example must be made of them. 
COLIN: Ah, clemency. 
GREY: Therefore it is ordained that there will be those required as witnesses. 
JAMIE: Traitors, you mean. 
GREY: Witnesses. Those not wanting to turn King's evidence will be hanged. 
TRASK: Pipe down! Pipe down, you dogs! 
GREY: Wait! There is, there is another alternative. Thank you, Mister Trask. 
TRASK: Arr! 
GREY: Plantation workers are required to work in his Majesty's colonies in the West Indies. I have here seven year contracts. Sign your name to these and you will receive free transportation to your new homes. Well? Which of you lucky lads will be the first to sign? 
(One of the Highlanders goes to the table.) 
WILLY: Don't touch that pen! I know fine what you offer, Mister Solicitor. I have seen these plantations in the Indies. Not one of you men that signs will live out your seven years. Better a quick and honourable death at the end of a rope, than a long slow one after months of 
GREY: Who is this man? 
TRASK: Willy MacKay, former master of this vessel. I should have done for him long ago. 
GREY: Later, Trask, later. Listen to me, all of you. You've heard what MacKay here offers you. Death with honour? What, lingering on the end of a halter? Followed, may I remind you, by quartering and the like courtesies extended to rebels. I offer you life, with a chance to work for your eventual liberty. 
WILLY: Liberty? 
GREY: Unless of course, Mister MacKay, you would care to turn King's evidence. For the rest of you, for those who wish to sign, over here. For those who wish to hang, over there. Make your choice! 
(Only Jamie, Ben, Willy and Colin don't line up to sign.) 
TRASK: Right, line up over here. That's it, stand in a line ye. Now, pipe down. Get those signatures on the contract. Pipe down there! 
GREY: Well, well, MacKay. Only four for the gallows? 
BEN: Now hang on a minute 
JAMIE: No, Ben, you can't! 
COLIN: Oh, let him go, let him go. 
BEN: I'm not a Scots, but can I sign? 
GREY: Why not? 
BEN: Can I read it first? 
GREY: Of course. 
(Ben starts to read, then tears the contracts to pieces.) 
TRASK: You scurvy swab! 
(Trask lashes out with the handle of his whip, knocking Ben down.) 
GREY: Clap him in irons. When I return with new contracts, we'll bind him and drop him from the highest yard-arm. 
TRASK: Mister Solicitor, mark this! 
GREY: All of you! The next man who tries to oppose me will not be so fortunate. See to it. 
TRASK: Right, Parker, clap him in irons. 
(The unconscious Ben is dragged off.)

[Inverness - Sea Eagle inn]

(Perkins is entertaining the uneasy Kirsty and Polly.) 
POLLY: Mister Grey doesn't seem to be coming. I think we'd better be off. 
PERKINS: Oh surely, ladies, you won't deprive an old fellow of your charming company? I assure you he won't be long. 
POLLY: Nevertheless, I think 
PERKINS: I insist! 
POLLY: No! 
PERKINS: Very well, I shall rouse the watch. They may be interested in two such genteel orange wenches. That's better. Now, to pass the time, what say you to a nice round of whist. 
DOCTOR: (woman) You need four for whist. 
PERKINS: Kindly remove yourself, madam. 
DOCTOR: There's nothing nicer than a nice game of whist. 
PERKINS: Madam, I told you. 
DOCTOR: (normal) I'm sure you'll oblige an old woman. 
(The Doctor is pointing Grey's pistol at Perkins.) 
PERKINS: The German Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Perhaps you'd like to count the trumps? 
PERKINS: Well, I, er. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear, clubs. Would you like to deal, Polly orange wench. 
GREY: Perkins, I want. What the devil are you at, man? 
PERKINS: Well I, er. Well I, er. Just playing a round of cards, Mister Grey. GREY: Indeed. Then you can just come up to my room. I want more contracts. 
POLLY: Mister Grey? 
GREY: Yes? 
POLLY: Nothing. 
GREY: Come along, Perkins, make haste. 
PERKINS: I have to go. 
DOCTOR: Not just yet. Remember, you have seen nothing. 
PERKINS: What? 
DOCTOR: Your eyes. 
PERKINS: Eyes? 
DOCTOR: Yes. You wouldn't want another headache, now would you? 
PERKINS: Oh, no, no, no. But er. 
DOCTOR: I tell you what we're going to do. We ladies are going to leave first, but you are going to sit here, quietly, comfortably, for another ten minutes. 
PERKINS: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Before you leave, because I am going to watch you all the time. And if you move 
PERKINS: Yes, I understand, sir. 
DOCTOR: Now, girls, let's leave this rough place. Ten minutes, remember? 
PERKINS: Ten minutes, Doctor. Ten minutes.

[Barn]

POLLY: Come on, it's quite safe. All right? 
DOCTOR: Very good, very good. 
POLLY: That horrible little man's face. 
KIRSTY: Twas a picture right enough. 
POLLY: Hey, why did he call you the German doctor, Doctor? Doctor, be careful! 
KIRSTY: You'll have the town upon us! 
(The Doctor has fired the pistol.) 
DOCTOR: It's not loaded. They're dangerous things. 
POLLY: You know, those dresses really do suit you, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Oh, you saucy girl. 
KIRSTY: You're the very image of my old granny McLaren. 
POLLY: You're wonderful, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: I know. 
POLLY: You've even managed to cheer old Kirsty up. 
KIRSTY: Oh, aye. I'd forgotten. 
POLLY: Now what are we going to do? 
DOCTOR: Do? What do you mean, do? 
POLLY: Doctor, don't go all sleepy on us now. We've got to do something. 
DOCTOR: All right, go ahead. 
POLLY: If only we knew where the others were. 
DOCTOR: They're on the ship. 
POLLY: What? 
DOCTOR: They're on the ship, the Annabelle. Master's name, Trask. Not a nice man. You wouldn't like him. 
(The Doctor lies back in the hay and closes his eyes.) 
POLLY: Doctor! Doctor! Look, if they're on the ship, then we've got to get them off it. Or 
DOCTOR: Or what? 
POLLY: Or capture the ship. 
KIRSTY: What would we do that for? 
POLLY: Well, couldn't you sail to somewhere safe? I mean, wasn't France your ally, or something? 
KIRSTY: I won't leave Scotland. 
DOCTOR: It'd be safer. 
KIRSTY: Never. 
DOCTOR: Well it wouldn't be for very long. Just for seven, just for a few years, and then it'd be safe to come back. 
KIRSTY: But why should I leave my own country? 
DOCTOR: Oh, please yourself. But you and your father may get killed if you stay in the glens. 
KIRSTY: Are you sure there's no other way? 
POLLY: Look, the Doctor says it won't be for long. 
KIRSTY: What must we do? 
POLLY: We must make a plan. Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Hmm? 
POLLY: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Hmm! 
POLLY: Have you got a plan for us? 
DOCTOR: No. 
POLLY: Oh, go on, I know you better than that. You must have a plan. 
DOCTOR: Well, it's just a wee idea really. 
POLLY: Go on. 
DOCTOR: I've only just thought about it. It won't work, but it'd be a try. Anyone got any money? 
POLLY: Yes, seventeen guineas that we pinched from the English Lieutenant. 
DOCTOR: That's a fortune in these days. Now, we want weapons, lots of them, and a rowing boat. 
KIRSTY: I can get a rowing boat. 
DOCTOR: Good, and we can buy the weapons. 
POLLY: Can we? 
DOCTOR: From the English soldiers. Well, they're bound to have heaps of weapons as souvenirs. 
POLLY: Yes, but will they sell them to us? 
DOCTOR: You don't know the English soldier. He'd sell his grandmother for tuppence ha'penny. 
KIRSTY: And then? 
DOCTOR: We smuggle them aboard the Annabelle. 
POLLY: That's great. And then what? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know, we'll think of something. I must get some sleep. 
POLLY: Doctor! Doctor! Oh.

[Annabelle deck]

(Perkins and Grey have been rowed over. Grey goes aboard, followed by Perkins carrying the papers.) 
GREY: Mister Trask! Devil take him, where is the man? Mister Trask! Ah, you. Go and fetch Mister Trask. Mister Trask! 
TRASK: Aye? 
GREY: Is everything in readiness? 
TRASK: It is. 
GREY: I've had Perkins here copy out three contracts, just to make sure. And if anyone tries that trick again of tearing them up, shoot him down immediately. 
TRASK: Don't you worry about that. 
GREY: We need two of the contracts to be signed. 
TRASK: Every man jack of them will sign. If not with ink, then with blood. Tis all the one to me. 
GREY: No. You're not dealing with slaves, man. These Highlanders are men of high courage and resolution. Flog but one of them, they'll all stand together and refuse to sign a thing. You'll undo everything I've worked for. No, once they're safely sold in Barbados they can be whipped to death for all I care. Until then, use a light fist, or you'll answer to me. 
TRASK: And the London deserter, what about him? 
GREY: Proceed with the ducking. It'll serve as a useful encouragement to the rest. Perkins, go below. Make the preparations. 
PERKINS: Yes, sir. 
GREY: And, Perkins, bring the deserter on deck. 
PERKINS: Of course, sir.

[Barn]

(Polly and Kirsty have obtained a meagre supply of weapons and are waiting for the Doctor to come back.) 
POLLY: Haven't done very well, have we? 
KIRSTY: They wouldn't take me seriously. 
POLLY: No, nor me. I do hope the Doctor's had better luck. (knocking) Who's there? 
DOCTOR [OC}: Me. 
(The Doctor pushes in a small hand barrow covered with a tarpaulin.) 
POLLY: Let's see, Doctor. What have you got? 
DOCTOR: No. Let's see yours first. 
POLLY: Oh look, don't tease us. Look. 
DOCTOR: Oh. It's a start. 
(The Doctor reveals a large pile of swords, muskets, and pistols.) 
KIRSTY: You must have robbed the Duke's arsenal. 
DOCTOR: Yes, something like that. 
POLLY: You're fantastic. 
DOCTOR: I know. 
KIRSTY: Look, there's a bonnie one. 
DOCTOR: Just a minute. 
KIRSTY: What is it? 
DOCTOR: This ring. Now, let me see. 
POLLY: Oh, that. It's her father's. She won't let you touch it. 
DOCTOR: I'm not surprised. It's not her father's. 
KIRSTY: You're lying! 
POLLY: What! 
KIRSTY: It is! 
DOCTOR: Then why has it the Stuarts' seal? 
KIRSTY: My father bade me not tell where he got it. 
DOCTOR: Until the right time. That time has now arrived. 
KIRSTY: The Prince gave it to my father off his own hand in heat of battle. My father saved the Prince's life. 
DOCTOR: Then it is right and proper that it should now save his life. Give it me. Thank you. I wonder. Bait. 
KIRSTY: What? 
DOCTOR: Bait for a very greedy man.

[Annabelle deck]

(Ben is carried on deck with his arms and legs bound. Another rope is tied around his waist.) 
TRASK: Right, lads, take him up. 
(Ben is hoisted into the air and swung out over the side of the ship. At a signal from Trask he is dropped into the water. A stream of bubbles rises to the surface.)

Episode Four

[Annabelle deck]

(At last, Trask signals for Ben to be hauled up again. But there is no one on the end of the rope.) 
GREY: He's not escaped? 
(On the other side of the ship, Ben surfaces in the shadows. He catches his breath then swims for the shore. A fog descends and he loses track of the time.)

[Quayside]

(Finally he reaches the quay and just manages to pull himself onto the jetty. After a few gasps, he looks up to see the business end of a musket.) 
BEN: Oh, no. Not after all that. I give up. 
(The soldier peels off his moustache.) 
BEN: It's you, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Who else would be walking around the jetty at this time of night dressed like a soldier who'd been wounded in battle? 
BEN: Yeah, you've got a point there. But why? 
DOCTOR: Why? Because I like it here. Besides, it keeps the other soldiers away. 
BEN: Oh, I'm cold and hungry. 
DOCTOR: I know just the place. Hold that. I'll just get these things aboard the boat. 
BEN: The boat? 
DOCTOR: Just a few wee gifties for our friends aboard the Annabelle. Come on.

[Captain's cabin]

PERKINS: There you are, sir, all signed and attested. It but wants your signature. 
GREY: Not before time. 
TRASK: A little wine for your cold heart, lawyer? 
GREY: I never mix liquor with business. I would advise you to do the same. We sail on the morning tide, remember. 
TRASK: Happen it's too foggy to sail, what then? 
GREY: (sternly) You sail, fog or no fog. 
TRASK: And crash the old girl's timbers on Chanonry Point. 
GREY: I took you for a seaman. 
TRASK: Why, that I am. I am! Trask'll get your cargo of little booties to Barbados, never fear. That's what really counts, lawyer. Not those dried up bits of parchment of yours. 
GREY: Without these bits of parchment, we would all sail foul of the King's law. 
TRASK: Law? What does the law or anyone care for those Highland cattle we carry? 
GREY: Nothing. But to take these cattle safely to the slave plantations, before their strength is sapped by his Majesty's prisons, that takes skill and preparation. 
TRASK: And what would happen to you and me if this trade were to be discovered to the Duke? 
GREY: That will never happen, Trask. There are but three of us privy to this secret. I can answer for myself and Perkins. Ay, Perkins? 
PERKINS: Oh, yes sir. Yes sir, indeed you may. 
GREY: As for you, Captain, you must answer for yourself. 
TRASK: Twas but in jest. You know me, Solicitor. I'm your man. 
GREY: Aye, and that is the way you will remain, Mister Trask.

[Barn]

(Ben is finishing off a meal of stew and bread.) 
BEN: Ah, that's better. Never thought I'd live to see a meal like that again. 
POLLY: But listen Ben, how did you manage to get loose? Underwater, I mean? 
BEN: Well it's the old Houdini trick, duchess. You flex your muscles when they tie you up, then when you're ready, you relax them. Well that way you're half the size you were before. Get it? 
KIRSTY: No. 
POLLY: And that's all there is to it? 
BEN: Well, almost all. 
POLLY: I bet. 
POLLY: Hey you've got your own clothes back. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Can you imagine, I found them thrown out on the rubbish dump, behind the inn. 
BEN: Amazing, isn't it? Well mine should be dry by now. 
POLLY: I liked you better in your dress, Doctor. 
KIRSTY: Aye, you made a good granny. 
DOCTOR: Now then, do we all know what we have to do? Ben? 
BEN: Yeah, I take you out to the ship in the rowing boat. Then double round the back smartish while they're sorting you out, and then pass the weapons through the porthole. 
POLLY: While Kirsty and I just sit here and wait for you to get back, if you ever do. No fear. 
KIRSTY: We've done enough waiting. 
DOCTOR: But it may be dangerous. They may not swallow my story. 
BEN: Yeah, and they may see me in the boat, even with this on. 
(Ben pulls a tam-o'-shanter over his face.) 
DOCTOR: I would like a hat like that. 
POLLY: Nevertheless, we're not going to let you two out of our sights, are we, Kirsty? Well, you get into such terrible trouble without us. 
DOCTOR: Very well, you shall come in the rowing boat. It might be a good idea at that. 
BEN: Well, what do you want me to do now? 
DOCTOR: I've got another idea for you, Ben.

[Annabelle's hold]

WILLY: I can hardly believe it. They've played right into Solicitor Grey's hands. My own crew amongst them. 
COLIN: Can you blame them? It's a poor choice between the gallows and the plantations. A man will clutch at any straw to save his skin. 
JAMIE: And what will they do with us, sir? 
COLIN: I fear they will make an example of us, once Trask gets away to sea. 
WILLY: He'll not let me live, that's for sure. Ach well, better a fast death than a lingering one under the overseers. I've no regrets. 
COLIN: If I could see my Kirsty again, I'd die content.

[Captain's cabin]

GREY: Three thousand five hundred guineas. You will collect this amount in gold on delivery of the prisoners and render strict accounting to me. Is that clear? 
PERKINS: Yes, sir, Mister Grey, sir. Quite clear, sir. You may trust me to the death, sir. 
GREY: Now I must return ashore. I shall expect to see you in London at the end of October. Meanwhile, keep a close eye on Trask. He's not 
TRASK [OC]: Right lads, bring him down. 
(Trask flings open the door and the Doctor is dragged in.) 
DOCTOR: Want to see him. 
TRASK: Us has got company, Mister Solicitor. Caught him coming over the side, bold as a welsh pirate. 
DOCTOR: (German) And of my own free will. I'm delighted to meet you again, Mister Solicitor Grey. 
GREY: You may not be so delighted when we part company this time, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: If you'd ask these fellows to let go of my arms, I have a small token for you. 
GREY: Indeed. I have not forgotten the last one. All right, let him go. 
TRASK: Let me have him. I'll soon change his tune. 
GREY: Silence! Perkins, the door. 
PERKINS: Please? 
GREY: Well, go on. 
DOCTOR: Now then, let me see, where did I put it. No, it's not in there. I transferred it from there, into this pocket. Well it's not there now, perhaps it's in here. 
TRASK: Why, you! 
GREY: I would advise you to find this token quickly, before I leave you to the tender mercies of Mister Trask. 
DOCTOR: Got it! 
(The Doctor produces Kirsty's ring.) 
DOCTOR: Here we are. Look at the seal. 
GREY: The Stuart arms. 
DOCTOR: Well, Mister Grey? 
GREY: Where did you get this? 
DOCTOR: From the hands of Prince Charles himself. 
GREY: Where, man, where? 
DOCTOR: In prison. 
GREY: I don't follow. 
DOCTOR: It's perfectly easy. Prince Charles disguised himself as a Highlander and was taken prisoner with the rest of the rebels. 
GREY: And where is he now? 
DOCTOR: I wonder what that information would be worth? Now let me see. 
TRASK: I'll burn it out of him. 
GREY: No! How much do you think it to be worth, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well, shall we say, ten thousand guineas?

[Annabelle's hold]

(Polly and Kirsty bring the rowing boat alongside the ship. Kirsty looks through a gun port. Nothing, so they move on to the next. Further on still, she finally finds her father.) 
KIRSTY [OC]: Father. Father. 
COLIN: Hmm? 
KIRSTY [OC]: Father. 
COLIN: Aye, my child. 
KIRSTY [OC]: Father, listen to me. 
COLIN: I hear you, Kirsty. 
KIRSTY [OC]: Father, it's me. It's Kirsty. I'm here. 
COLIN: (waking) Aye. Ah, I must be dreaming. Kirsty. 
KIRSTY [OC]: Whist, keep your voice down. 
COLIN: Where are you? 
KIRSTY [OC]: I'm outside here, in a boat. 
COLIN: My child, are you well? They havna harmed you? 
KIRSTY [OC]: Father, I'm fine. And you? 
COLIN: Better. A world better for hearing your voice. But you canna stay there. They'll find you. 
KIRSTY [OC]: Here, then, take this. 
(Kirsty passes a pistol through the port hole.) 
COLIN: It's a miracle. I must be in a dream. 
KIRSTY [OC]: Father, it's no dream. We've got arms for all of you and a plan. Can you come closer? Right, now listen.

[Captain's cabin]

GREY: You drive a hard bargain, Doctor, but no matter. I agree. Now, where is he? 
DOCTOR: The very last place you would think of looking for him. 
GREY: Well? 
DOCTOR: Right here on this ship. 
TRASK: Let me have him! 
GREY: A dangerous jest! 
DOCTOR: Did you mark the young Highlander who was with me? The piper? 
GREY: Piper? 
DOCTOR: With the soft hands and face? 
GREY: No. 
DOCTOR: Did you notice his hair? Unmistakable, that was the Prince. 
GREY: You had better be very sure. 
DOCTOR: Would I come and place myself in your hands if I was not very sure? 
TRASK: We'll smell out the Pretender right now, by heaven. 
GREY: Come along then. Perkins. 
DOCTOR: Aren't you forgetting one thing? 
GREY: What? 
DOCTOR: I'm the only one who knows what he looks like. 
GREY: Bring him along then. Make haste.

[Annabelle's hold]

(The Highlanders are apparently asleep. Trask enters quietly, followed by Grey, Perkins, the Doctor and two armed sailors.) 
LOOKOUT: (sotto) Go to sleep. 
TRASK: In here, Doctor. 
GREY: Quiet. If they have any suspicion of whom we're looking and know him to be here 
TRASK: Arr. Come on, Doctor. Him? Him? 
DOCTOR: No. 
TRASK: What about him? 
DOCTOR: No. Perhaps he is further over. 
GREY: If you have made a mistake. 
DOCTOR: I've found him. He's the little one, over there. 
(The Doctor points at Jamie, over on the far side.) 
COLIN: Creag an tuire! 
(The Highlanders leap up, armed with sword, pistol and musket. The two sailors try to run but are cut off and surrender. Grey and Perkins do likewise. Only Trask tries to fight, so Willy comes forward to take his revenge.) 
JAMIE: Creag an tuire! 
(Jamie leads the Highlanders out on deck. Willy is weakening in the fight, but manages to stab Trask's shoulder.) 
WILLY: Now I shall relieve you of your command! 
TRASK: Not yet, Willy MacKay! 
(Trask wounds him and heads up on deck.)

[Annabelle's deck]

(The fighting continues with the sailors being driven back to the poop deck.) 
TRASK: Right, lads, to me! Throw the scurvy swabs over the side! I'm still master here! 
BEN: Not for long, mate. 
TRASK: You! I'll make sure of you this time, lad. 
(Trask advances on Ben, cutlass raised. Ben trips and falls. Jamie swings across on a rope and knocks Trask down. Ben gets out of the way as Jamie forces Trask to the ship's rail, where he goes overboard as Willy comes on deck.) 
WILLY: Where's Trask? 
JAMIE: In the firth. 
WILLY: Good lad. Hold! Come back! Hold! All of ye. I want men. Get them over here. That's right, we sail for France on the next tide. I want willing hands. If you hadn't volunteered you'd have had a long cold swim for it. Right now, make ready. Off with ye, go on! Up to the top. Off with ye! 
(As the sailors set to, the Doctor comes on deck and helps Kirsty and Polly on board.) 
DOCTOR: Ben, well done, well done, well done. Kirsty, here's your father. There we are. Polly 
KIRSTY: Father! 
DOCTOR: Got lost in the fog. 
POLLY: Well done, well done. 
BEN: Oh, don't over do it, Pol. 
POLLY: But we've won! 
DOCTOR: Only for the moment. 
POLLY: What do you mean? 
BEN: Well, the real job's only just beginning. Getting back to the Tardis with only a rough idea of where it is and the whole English army out to stop us. 
POLLY: What are we going to do? 
BEN: Well, we're going to get ashore before they get under way. That's the first thing. Right, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Right. 
WILLY: Stand by the capstan. 
DOCTOR: We have to go ashore now. 
WILLY: Oh, don't bother me now, man. Stand by at the end of the rope here. 
COLIN: What about the prisoners? 
DOCTOR: We'll take Mister Grey ashore as a hostage. 
COLIN: And the clerk? 
DOCTOR: Well I 
PERKINS: Now, may I have converse with you. 
COLIN: Yea, man, yea. 
PERKINS: Don't send me ashore with that man, sir. Now, if you are going to France, then maybe you can do with a secretary. Especially one who is conversant with the French tongue. 
COLIN: Shifting with the wind, you rogue. Well, Doctor, what do you say? 
DOCTOR: Many of your people speak French? 
COLIN: Aye, but little. 
DOCTOR: Then take him with you. He'll stay loyal enough. 
PERKINS: Oh, I will, I will, sir. 
DOCTOR: Till the wind shifts again. Laird, we must go. 
COLIN: Doctor, I 
DOCTOR: Bring the prisoner over! 
PERKINS: Mister Solicitor! 
GREY: Well, Perkins? 
(Perkins snaps his fingers at Grey.) 
PERKINS: I've been wanting to do that for a long time. You've no idea the pleasure that gave me. 
GREY: Why you 
PERKINS: Sir.

[Quayside]

POLLY: I can't even see the ship. 
BEN: No, they said they'd send us a signal before they went. Hey, look. There it is! 
(A small light waves across the firth and vanishes.) 
POLLY: Do you think they'll beat the English blockade? 
DOCTOR: The fog will help them. More than it will help us. 
POLLY: We never even said goodbye to Jamie. 
BEN: No, he just disappeared. I wonder where he went to. 
JAMIE: Right here. 
BEN: Jamie! 
POLLY: Jamie! 
JAMIE: Aye, himself. 
BEN: Well, why didn't you go with the others? 
JAMIE: Well, let's say I fancied my chances here better. Besides, you'll need someone to guide you through the glen, won't you? 
BEN: How did you know? 
DOCTOR: Glad to have you with us, Jamie. 
POLLY: But won't you be in danger here though? 
JAMIE: Ach, if they can survive here, so can I. 
BEN: Hey, watch it! Quick, through these doors.

[Boathouse]

(Ben and Jamie drag Grey inside as two soldiers appear.) 
POLLY: They're going away. It's all right. 
GREY: Help! 
JAMIE: One more move and you're a dead man. 
DOCTOR: They heard. 
POLLY: But what if they find us? 
DOCTOR: Shh. 
(The soldiers enter, see nothing and turn to leave.) 
GREY: Mmph! 
(Ben and Jamie tackle one Redcoat as the Doctor grapples the other. They overpower the soldiers and knock them out as Grey makes his escape.) 
JAMIE: I'm certainly glad I'm on your side. 
DOCTOR: Grey! 
POLLY: The window! 
DOCTOR: No. No, Ben. It's too late. 
BEN: But he was our hostage. They'll never let us get to the Tardis now! 
DOCTOR: We'll find someone else, eh, Polly?

[Outside the Sea Eagle Inn]

FFINCH: What the? 
(He turns to see Ben holding a pistol to his chest.) 
BEN: We want your company, mate. 
DOCTOR: If you don't mind. 
POLLY: You won't refuse us, Algy dear. 
FFINCH: Oh, this is really too much. 
POLLY: This way. 
COLONEL: Damn it, man. Where the devil do you think you're going? 
FFINCH: Colonel! 
COLONEL: Well, have you forgotten it's your deal, Ffinch? 
FFINCH: Yes, sir, I know. But, I was just 
COLONEL: Well, who are these vagabonds? 
FFINCH: Well, Colonel they're 
DOCTOR: (German) Doctor von Wer at your service. Remedies for the ague, the twitch, the colic, the warts and the gout. 
COLONEL: The gout? I haven't got the gout. 
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't waste your time with that, a fine healthy gentleman like yourself. No, it's this ring you see, sir. 
FFINCH: Perhaps we'd better get back to the game, sir. The night air. 
COLONEL: Oh, blast the night air. Let me see. The Pretender's ring! Where'd you get this, man? 
DOCTOR: Well, you go up there and to the left. No perhaps it's better to explain this way. To the right 
COLONEL: Look what are you talking about? 
DOCTOR: No. On second thought, perhaps the other way. We were taking the Lieutenant, you see, sir. 
FFINCH: The game, sir. 
COLONEL: Confound the game, this is the Prince's ring. Go with them. Take an attachment. 
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, sir. 
COLONEL: What? 
DOCTOR: That might frighten the blackguard, sir. We are enough to apprehend him. 
COLONEL: All right, go on, Lieutenant. You have your orders, what are you waiting for? 
FFINCH: Yes, sir. But, this wench 
(Polly starts to pull out Ffinch's ID disc which she is wearing around her neck.) 
FFINCH: Yes, sir. Very good, sir. 
COLONEL: And when you have them 
DOCTOR: We will bring him back to you, sir. Right? 
COLONEL: Right.

[Cottage]

(Almost dawn.) 
JAMIE: You know where you are now? 
BEN: Yeah, I won't forget this place in a hurry. 
DOCTOR: Well, it's time we said goodbye, Lieutenant. And thank you. 
POLLY: I've been telling him all about Mister Grey's activities. 
BEN: Yeah, you want to nab him quick. 
POLLY: Oh, Algy, here you are and thank you very much. 
(Polly gives Ffinch his ID disc.) 
FFINCH: It was nothing. 
(Suddenly Redcoats appear and Grey walks in.) 
GREY: Ah, so you found these rebels, Lieutenant? Well done. 
FFINCH: No! 
GREY: You can escort them with me to Inverness. You will not escape the gallows this time, Doctor. Any of you. As for you, wench, I'll have you tied to the tail of a cart and whipped from one end of 
FFINCH: Silence! 
GREY: What was that you said? 
FFINCH: I've heard the whole story of your schemes from this young lady here. 
GREY: You take the word of this 
DOCTOR: What wicked times we live in, Lieutenant. A prison commissioner using his office to smuggle rebels out of the country. 
GREY: You're wasting your breath, Doctor. It was all perfectly legal. The rebels signed the contracts for transportation of their own free will. 
DOCTOR: Contracts? I don't believe I saw any contracts. Did you, Ben? 
BEN: No, I wouldn't know what they were. 
DOCTOR: Or you Jamie? 
JAMIE: Me? No. 
GREY: A lie, Lieutenant. The contracts were signed, I have them right here in my 
DOCTOR: So sad. Once a promising legal talent. 
FFINCH: There is only one end for slave traders, Solicitor. I'm placing you under arrest. 
GREY: I warn you, Lieutenant 
FFINCH: I've had enough of your warnings, sir. Gag him, Sergeant. Take him to prison under escort. 
SERGEANT: Sir! 
GREY: No, wait! This is some sort of trick, you fool. If the Colonel hears of this you'll be lucky to end up as a band master. 
FFINCH: Take him away, Sergeant. 
SERGEANT: Come on, you traitorous dog. 
GREY: Fool. 
SERGEANT: You men follow me. 
(The Redcoats remove Grey.) 
FFINCH: Well, goodbye, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Goodbye. 
BEN: Goodbye. 
POLLY: Wait. Algy, why did you do it? 
FFINCH: A chance to put paid to a villain, ma'am. 
POLLY: It wasn't just that, was it? 
FFINCH: Not quite, ma'am. 
POLLY: Thank you, Algy. (kiss) Goodbye. 
FFINCH: Well, I wouldn't linger here if I were you. These moors, you know, they're still scouring them for rebels. 
DOCTOR: Goodbye. 
FFINCH: Goodbye. 
BEN: Ta-ta. 
JAMIE: One thing I don't understand. Where those contracts went? 
DOCTOR: I've no idea. 
(The Doctor pulls the papers from his pocket.) 
DOCTOR: Well how did they get there? 
BEN: You old fraud. Come on, we must go. 
POLLY: What about Jamie? We can't leave him here. 
DOCTOR: True. His ship's sailed. 
POLLY: What will you do? 
JAMIE: Oh, I'll be all right. They won't catch me. 
BEN: Did you hear that! They'll catch us all if we don't move fast. 
POLLY: Doctor, can we take him with us? 
DOCTOR: If he teaches me to play the bagpipes. 
JAMIE: If you want, Doctor. 
BEN: That's all we need. Come on. 
POLLY: Come on, Jamie. 
JAMIE: But where are we going? 
POLLY: You'll see.

[Culloden moor]

(The travellers return to the Tardis, and Jamie watches in amazement as the Doctor unlocks the blue box and goes inside, followed by Ben. Jamie hesitates, so Polly takes his hand and leads him in.)

[Tardis]

(Polly has led Jamie from Culloden moor into the Tardis. The doors close and the dematerialisation sequence starts.) 
JAMIE: What's this? 
DOCTOR: You'll find out. 
JAMIE: Ah, I don't think I want to. 
BEN: It's a machine, my old haggis, which will take us away from Scotland forever. 
JAMIE: Where to? 
BEN: Ah, well, that as the Doctor would say, that is in the lap of the gods. We never know. 
JAMIE: Aye, you'd not be leading me on now, would you? Is it a fact you don't know where we're going? 
POLLY: Quite true, and what's more we don't even know what year it will be either. 
JAMIE: Ach now, I don't believe it. 
DOCTOR: Nae man can tether time nor tide. Robert Burns.
(From Tam O'Shanter.) 
JAMIE: Ay? Who's Robert Burns? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I should have remembered. 
POLLY: What? 
DOCTOR: Well to Jamie, its 1746. Robert Burns wasn't born until 1759. 
BEN: Gets sort of complicated, don't it? 
JAMIE: What's happening now? 
BEN: We're just beginning to land. 
DOCTOR: Hold tight, everyone. 
JAMIE: Land? 
POLLY: Don't be scared, Jamie, it's all right really. 
BEN: I get a sort of queer feeling. See we never know what we're going to find, do we? 
DOCTOR: Ah, that's the fun. Stand by, here we go. 
POLLY: Please let it be Chelsea 1966. 
BEN: Hope it's the Daleks, I don't think. 
DOCTOR: Prehistoric monsters. 
JAMIE: What have I come upon? 
(The Tardis materialises.) 
JAMIE: That wasn't too bad. Let's go outside, Doctor. 
BEN: Yeah, come on, Jamie, you and me first. Well, you never know, you know. 
JAMIE: What? 
BEN: We don't know what's going to be waiting for us out there, do we? Come on, Doctor, open up. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I don't see why not. It looks all right to me. (The doors open.) Wait! 
(The Doctor grabs his stove-pipe hat.) 
DOCTOR: For me.

[Beach].

(It's a rocky sea shore.) 
POLLY: This time I'll guess where we are. 
DOCTOR: All right then, where are we? 
POLLY: Cornwall. 
BEN: Ah, you said that last time. 
POLLY: And I was right. 
JAMIE: The Isles, maybe. 
BEN: Don't you know? 
DOCTOR: Haven't a clue. Not the isles of Britain, anyway. 
POLLY: How can you tell? 
DOCTOR: This rock. It's volcanic. It's not very old either. 
BEN: How old? 
DOCTOR: Oh, miocene. 
BEN + POLLY: What? 
DOCTOR: It's only about 25 million years old. Look. 
(Inland, a mountainous peak rises high above them.) 
BEN: Hey, that's an extinct volcano, isn't it? 
DOCTOR: Possibly, possibly. 
JAMIE: Are we not going for a wee look round? 
POLLY: Yes, lets. Come on. 
(Polly, Ben and Jamie head off up the side of the volcano.) 
POLLY: Oh, give us a hand. 
BEN: Here. 
(The higher they go, the steeper the slope. On the beach, the Doctor takes out his pocket watch and checks the time against the position of the sun)

[Mountainside]

(The group stop for a rest half way up.) 
BEN: I don't reckon we're going to see much when we get there. 
POLLY: Ben? 
BEN: What now? 
POLLY: I'm beginning to see things. 
BEN: Where? 
POLLY: Down there, look. I'm sure I saw something moving. 
BEN: Ah, you're round the twist. 
POLLY: Look, there it is again. 
BEN: You see anything? 
JAMIE: Nothing. 
POLLY: Ben, I think we ought to go back. 
BEN: No, not me, I'm having a dekko down here. 
JAMIE: Yeah, me too. 
POLLY: Wait for me! 
(Polly struggles after the men. They stop again just below the summit.) POLLY: Oh, can't we stop and have a breather? 
JAMIE: Ben and I'll go on. You stay here. 
POLLY: Oh, no. 
BEN: We shan't be long, love, back before you know it. 
POLLY: All right. 
(Polly looks at the view. They are on the largest of a chain of islands, some no more than large rocks. The ocean surrounds them in all directions. The sound of falling pebbles lures Polly to a cave entrance a short distance away. She goes inside. It is dark, but once her eyes have acclimatised Polly sees an elaborate bracelet on the floor, with a design of a kneeling figure holding a burning torch. She bends to pick it up and a shadow falls over her. Polly screams.) 
BEN: Hey, that's Polly. 
(Ben and Jamie run back to where they left Polly.) 
BEN: Polly? Polly? 
(Jamie spots the cave entrance.) 
JAMIE: She must have gone inside. 
BEN: Hang on, I've got a torch.

[Cave]

BEN: Polly?

[Beach]

(The Doctor has finished his calculations and is looking around carefully in the rock pools. He finds some shards of pottery.) 
DOCTOR: Mediterranean. Oh no, tidal sea, can't be. That's funny, it hasn't been fired long. 
(The Doctor puts the pottery into his pocket and goes to find the others.)

[Tunnel].

BEN: Polly? 
(In the cave, Ben and Jamie find a tunnel leading deeper into the mountain.) 
BEN: Polly, where are you? 
JAMIE: Polly? 
BEN: What's that? 
(A weighted net falls onto them and they are pushed into a metal cage hanging over a pit.)

[Cage]

POLLY: Ben, Jamie, is it you? 
BEN: Who do you think it is? 
JAMIE: Are you all right, Polly? 
POLLY: Yes. 
BEN: When you're finished get us out of this contraption. 
POLLY: I can't. They've tied me up. 
JAMIE: Who are they? 
POLLY: I don't know, I didn't see them. 
(The door opens and another person is pushed into the cage with them.) 
BEN: That's all we needed. 
DOCTOR: So they caught you too. 
(The cage lurches and descends. The wind whistles past them.) 
BEN: Left half me stomach behind. 
JAMIE: Aye, me too. 
POLLY: Where are we going? 
DOCTOR: That we shall find out very soon. 
POLLY: Wherever it is it's an awful long way down. 
DOCTOR: Yes, we must be below sea level already. 
JAMIE: It's difficult to breathe. 
BEN: What is it, Doctor? 
POLLY: It's a funny taste. I don't feel very well. 
DOCTOR: Here we are. 
(The Doctor unties Polly.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, don't be frightened anybody. If we pass out it's compressed nitrogen. It's called caissons disease. 
BEN: Polly, try and get us out of here. 
POLLY: I'll try. 
(Polly struggles with the net, but passes out. The cage reaches the bottom of the shaft. All four are unconscious as four guards in primitive clothes take them to a small chamber and lie them out of padded benches to recover.)

[Chamber]

DOCTOR: Oh. 
BEN: Where's this? Polly? Jamie? 
JAMIE: Oh. 
BEN: Come on, man, rise and shine. 
JAMIE: Would you disturb the dead. 
BEN: Oh you're not dead, you just got a touch of the submariners', that's all. 
JAMIE: What are they? 
BEN: It'd take too long to explain now. This must be some sort of compression chamber. 
DOCTOR: Troglodytes. 
BEN: What? 
DOCTOR: Ancient tribes from North Africa who lived in caves. Possibly, possibly. Where's my diary? 
BEN: Cave men? Hey, Jamie, you better watch it. With that kilt someone might mistake you for a bird. 
JAMIE: What? 
(Polly wakes, groaning.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, it's difficult to put a precise date on these people. 
POLLY: I don't think it is. 
DOCTOR: All right then, when? 
POLLY: Oh, I'd say about 1970. 
DOCTOR: Can you prove it? 
BEN: Yeah, go on, prove it. 
JAMIE: How d'you know, Polly? 
BEN: Ah, she's been studying her crystal ball. 
POLLY: Abracadabra. 
(Polly produces the bracelet she found.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, how interesting, yes. Hmm. It's Aztec. Fake of course. 
BEN: Mexico Olympiad. 
POLLY: When we first left Earth it hadn't happened yet. 
BEN: No, that's right, it wasn't due till 1968. 
POLLY: Right, so now is any time later than that. 
JAMIE: Later? Oh, I wish I understood. 
(The door opens. A guard carrying a trident enters.) 
BEN: Polly, you speak foreign. Go and talk to him. Ask him where we are. 
POLLY: Er, parlez-vous francais? Sprechen Sie deutsch? Habla si espanol? 
GUARD: Bazumi tampost postu! 
JAMIE: Au Gaelic akye? 
BEN: What's that? 
JAMIE: Gaelic. 
(The guards prods them to the door with his trident.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that means move in any language. I think we'd better comply. Women and children last. Polly?

[Reception area].

(Guards line the corridor to the small room where a table is being laid with food. The Doctor tries some.) 
DOCTOR: Oh food. 
(The guard raises his weapon to hit the serving girl, so the Doctor accidentally gets in the way.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm so sorry. Thank you. 
(The girl smiles and leaves hurriedly.) 
DOCTOR: This is good. 
(The guard leaves by another door.) 
DOCTOR: This is very good. Mmmm. It's delicious. This is excellent. Sit down, sit down. This is ambrosia. 
BEN: What's got into him? 
POLLY: I don't know. I've never seen him go for food like this before. It's usually hats. 
JAMIE: Better hurry or he'll scoff the lot. 
(But they don't share his enthusiasm for the cuisine.) 
BEN: What is it? 
DOCTOR: Plankton. 
JAMIE: Plankton? What's that? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's small plants and animals from the sea. 
POLLY: Animals? 
BEN: Yeah, little spidery ones. 
POLLY: Oh, I don't think I'm very hungry, thank you. 
DOCTOR: You'd better get used to it. I don't expect there's much else to be had around here. Visitors! 
(A striking figure in splendid robes sweeps into the room.) 
DOCTOR: Good day to you. 
(He is a priest, and is accompanied by guards.) 
RAMO: We've been expecting you. 
POLLY: He speaks English. 
BEN: What does he mean, he's been expecting us? We didn't know we were coming ourselves. 
RAMO: The living goddess Amdo sees and hears all. 
DOCTOR: And she had a message about us? For you? 
RAMO: Yes. She told us you would fall from the sky in time for our festival of the vernal equinox. 
DOCTOR: And just what part are we to play in this festival of the vernal equinox? 
RAMO: A very important part, I regret to say. Guards. 
(There's a scuffle.) 
DOCTOR: No! Wait! I have something important to say. 
RAMO: Be quick and say it then. 
DOCTOR: I won't speak under threats! 
RAMO: You have five minutes in which to make your point. After that you will join your companions. The ceremony will proceed. 
POLLY: Doctor? 
RAMO: Go, girl. 
DOCTOR: What will happen to them? 
RAMO: They will come to no harm. Yet. 
DOCTOR: You'll have to go, Polly. 
(The guards take Ben, Polly and Jamie away.) 
RAMO: Now, stranger, say what you have to and do not waste time. There is very little of it left for any of you. 
DOCTOR: What I have to say concerns a certain Professor Zaroff. 
RAMO: What do you know of Zaroff? 
DOCTOR: A great deal. He's here, isn't he? 
RAMO: How did you know? 
DOCTOR: The food. It couldn't be anyone else but Zaroff. He led the field in producing food from the sea. His progress is astonishing. 
RAMO: You are a friend of Zaroff's? 
DOCTOR: Just send him this message, and you'll see. 
(The Doctor takes out a pencil and paper.) 
RAMO: I will take no message to Zaroff. 
DOCTOR: You're making a big mistake! 
(The serving girl returns.) 
RAMO: Yes, what is it, Ara? 
ARA: I've come to clear the table. 
RAMO: Yes, yes, we've wasted enough time. 
DOCTOR: Ara, take this message to Professor Zaroff. 
ARA: But I

[Temple of Amdo]

(It is a cavernous space with a vaulted roof supported by carved pillars cut from the rock. There is a large idol of the goddess, a fish-woman hybrid. Her altar is lit by burning braziers and tended by priests. In the centre is a platform with four beams radiating out from its centre. Polly, Ben and Jamie are dragged before the altar.) 
POLLY: I'm scared. What are they going to do to us? 
JAMIE: I don't see the Doctor here. He's escaped, maybe. 
BEN: Ah, some chance of that. 
JAMIE: Oh, he's a canny one, yon Doctor. Dinna fash yourself, Polly. 
RAMO: Quiet! You profane the sacred temple with your idle chatter.

[Outside Zaroff's laboratory].

ARA: I must speak to Professor Zaroff. 
(The guard shakes his head.) 
ARA: Well, Damon then.

[Temple of Amdo]

JAMIE: Ben, should we run for it? 
BEN: No, wait till we hear from the Doctor. 
POLLY: It'd be better. 
(Acolytes bind them hand and foot then hoist them up and carry them to the platform. The priest removes a cover to reveal a deep well and shark infested waters below. Ben, Polly and Jamie are laid on the beams so their heads are together at the centre, pointing towards the well.) 
JAMIE: Put me down. 
POLLY: Ben? The Doctor isn't coming! 
BEN: Don't worry. As long as he's not here, there's still some hope. 
(Ramo escorts the Doctor in.) 
BEN: Oh, no. 
(The Doctor is led to the dais.)

[Surgeon's lab]

(Ara has been allowed to see the Chief Surgeon.) 
DAMON: Well, girl, what do you want? Why are you not at your work? 
ARA: I have a note for Professor Zaroff. It's very important. 
DAMON: A note for Zaroff? Let me see. Oh, come, girl.

[Temple of Amdo]

(The beams are held in place by ropes fastened to earthenware jars full of water as counterweights. The High Priest puts on the fish mask and speaks.) 
LOLEM: Life is a stream of water that drains away even as time does, and cannot be reclaimed. 
(A boy removes a stopper from each jar.) 
LOLEM: Accept, oh mighty and powerful Amdo, these, your sacrifices. 
(As the water flows from the jars, the beams start to tilt down into the shark pool.) 
POLLY: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Hold on! Hold on for your lives.

[Zaroff's laboratory]

(There is a scorpion fish in a tank.) 
DAMON: Here is the note. 
(It reads 'Vital secret will die with me' and is signed Doctor W. Zaroff crumples it)

[Temple of Amdo]

(The water continues to come out of the jars and the travellers slide slowly down the beams. Polly screams.) 
DOCTOR: Don't move. Don't even breathe. 
(Zaroff runs in.) 
ZAROFF: Stop the ceremony! 
RAMO: You dare to interfere with the hour of sacrifice? 
ZAROFF: I do not interfere with your sacrifices, but I must first speak with that man. Release him. 
RAMO: Release him. 
(Acolytes obey and help the Doctor to his feet.) 
ZAROFF: Now, this information you have, what is it? 
DOCTOR: First, release my friends. 
ZAROFF: I do not care about your friends. Your information, quick! 
DOCTOR: But I do. Professor Zaroff, if anything happens to them, you'll never know the secret I was going to tell you. 
ZAROFF: You! All right, release them. Take them to the labour controller. He will know what to do with them. Well, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: First, let me say how glad I am to see that the reports of your death twenty years previously are a little premature. 
ZAROFF: The whole world believed I had been kidnapped. 
DOCTOR: The East blamed the West. The West, the East. 
ZAROFF: Oh, I wish I could have been there. 
DOCTOR: Now here you are, the greatest scientific genius since Leonardo, under the sea. You must have a fantastic story to tell? 
ZAROFF: Perhaps I tell you someday, if you will live long enough to hear. Now this vital secret, what is it? I must know. 
(The Doctor makes sure that the others have been taken away.) 
DOCTOR: I haven't got one. 
ZAROFF: How dare you! 
DOCTOR: But I'm sure a that great man like you wouldn't want a modern scientific brain like mine to be sacrificed to a heathen idol? 
ZAROFF: You know I could have you torn to bits by my guards, yes? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZAROFF: I could feed you to my pet octopus, yes? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZAROFF: Well you have sense of humour. I too have sense of humour. I need men like you. (both laugh) You come with me, yes? 
DOCTOR: I come with you.

[Operating theatre]

(Jamie, Ben and Polly have been put in Damon's custody.) 
DAMON: Your lives have been spared. See that they contribute useful service to the community. 
BEN: Anything you say, mate. 
DAMON: What was that? 
BEN: Oh, nothing, nothing. 
DAMON: You men look strong. You'll be sent to the mines. Take them away. 
BEN: What? 
JAMIE: What does he mean, mines? 
BEN: Now wait a minute. Now what are you going to do with her? 
POLLY: Yes, what? 
DAMON: I shall decide that later. 
(Jamie and Ben are dragged out.) 
JAMIE: Don't lose heart, Polly! 
DAMON: Don't be afraid, girl. Life is very beautiful under the sea. Come along. 
(A shutter slides up to reveal the seabed lit by floodlights. Shadowy figures swim to and fro.) 
DAMON: Seventy percent of the world's surface is under the oceans. You are looking at our food producing area. Without it, we couldn't survive. 
POLLY: It's fantastic. What are those? 
DAMON: Those are our farmers. 
POLLY: I think it's splendid. All those people working under the sea to feed the others. But listen, how do they breathe? 
DAMON: We give them plastic gills. Look. 
(One of the fish people swims close to the window, peering in.) 
DAMON: That surprises you, doesn't it? 
POLLY: It's breathtaking. Oh, sorry. That wasn't meant to be a pun. 
DAMON: No, not at all. No, I'm glad you're taking it like this. Some people get most upset when they find they're to have the operation. 
POLLY: Operation? 
FOREMAN: Well, of course. We couldn't send you out there without it. You'd drown. 
POLLY: You're not turning me into a fish!

[Corridor].

DOCTOR: Just give me a clue, Professor. 
ZAROFF: West of Gibraltar, south of the Azores. The Atlantic ridge, what does that suggest to you? 
DOCTOR: Ancient temples under the sea. But that's not possible! That's only a legend. 
ZAROFF: Go on, go on, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: We're on the ancient kingdom of Atlantis. 
ZAROFF: Yes, yes, and this is not the perfect place to complete my work? 
DOCTOR: But how did you get them to accept you? Surely science is in opposition to ancient temple ritual and idol worship? 
ZAROFF: I gave them a sugar-coated pill. I have promised to lift Atlantis out of the sea. 
(A guard is waiting.) 
ZAROFF: Yes, what is it? Pardon me, Doctor. 
ARA: Doctor? Doctor? 
DOCTOR: What is it, Ara? 
ARA: It's the girl. They're going to carry out the fish operation on her. 
DOCTOR: Fish operation? Well, well, well. Ara, do you know where the main fuses are? 
ARA: Fuses? 
DOCTOR: Oh, never mind. Go back to Polly, and if the chance comes, get her away from there! Will you do that for me? 
ARA: Yes. 
ZAROFF: Doctor!

[Operating theatre].

(Polly has been dressed for surgery.) 
POLLY: Keep away! 
DAMON: Bring her here. 
(She is dragged to the operating table.) 
DAMON: Don't be difficult, girl, it's quite painless. Lights. 
POLLY: No! no! 
DAMON: We're ready now. 
POLLY: No! No! No! No! No! No! 
(Damon looms over her with a huge hypodermic syringe.) 
DAMON: One tiny jab, and you'll know nothing more about it until it's all over.

Episode Two

[Zaroff's laboratory]

ZAROFF: And so you see, my friend, it is all so simple. When Atlantis was submerged at the time of the flood, some life continued in air pockets in the mountain's caves, thanks to the natural air shaft provided by the extinct volcano. 
(The Doctor has a pair of wire-cutters behind his back.) 
ZAROFF: You like my laboratory, yes? You find all this very impressive, no? 
DOCTOR: No, not a bit, not a bit. 
ZAROFF: What do you mean? 
(The Doctor backs up to a power distribution panel, wire-cutters at the ready.) 
DOCTOR: I expected nothing less from the great Professor Zaroff.

[Operating room]

(Before Polly can be injected.) 
DAMON: The lights are playing up again. Go and see what's wrong. No, wait. I'd better go myself. Zaroff might listen to me. Look after the girl. 
NURSE: Right.

[Zaroff's laboratory]

ZAROFF: Yes, we have come a long way in our research, and luckily the riches of Atlantis have provided ample means. 
(He goes over to his pet octopus tank.) 
ZAROFF: Ah, so you are hungry today? Did I forget to feed you? Is beautiful, no? 
(Damon enters.) 
DAMON: Zaroff! 
ZAROFF: Not now, Damon. Can't you see I am talking with my friend here. 
DAMON: This won't wait. If I am to operate on the girl, I must have light. 
ZAROFF: One operation, one girl. You are making an unnecessary fuss. 
DAMON: I know what's going on. You're using so much voltage on the project that all civil use is curtailed. 
ZAROFF: Ridiculous. I will show you. You follow me. Open the panel. Ridiculous. There is nothing wrong with the civil supply. There's never anything wrong. Look, the supply to your clinic is always adequate and cannot be affected by demands elsewhere. 
DAMON: Zaroff! 
ZAROFF: The fault must lie at your own intake. 
DAMON: It's easy to make excuses. 
ZAROFF: Excuses! Who taught you, Damon? Everything you know, I've taught you. As I made you, so I can break you.

[Operating room]

(The room is plunged into darkness.) 
NURSE: So Zaroff will listen to him. You'd better go and get some light from somewhere. You'll find some in the old quarters. Don't worry, prisoner, we won't keep you waiting long. Ah, you, girl, come here. Keep watch on the prisoner while I search for fuses. And don't try any tricks, understand, or it will be worse for you. 
ARA: I understand. 
(The two men leave, and Ara starts unstrapping Polly from the operating table.) 
ARA: Girl? 
POLLY: What? 
ARA: Don't speak, just follow me. 
POLLY: But I can't see anything. 
ARA: Hold my hand. I'm used to the dark. Hurry, before they get back.

[Zaroff's laboratory]

(The Doctor's tampering has been noticed. He steps away from the power supply panel.) 
DOCTOR: I can't think of how I came to be so clumsy. I must have bumped into it. 
DAMON: You're not clumsy, Doctor. You did it on purpose. But you won't save the girl. 
(Damon leaves, and the Doctor tries to follow.) 
ZAROFF: Oh no, Doctor, you are staying here with me. 
DOCTOR: As your prisoner? 
ZAROFF: Let us say as my guest.

[Tunnel]

ARA: It's all clear, come on. 
POLLY: Oh, I feel as though I've run a hundred miles. But where? 
ARA: I know where to hide you. Come on.

[Zaroff's laboratory]

ZAROFF: Damon? Ha, he's just an Atlantean, a primitive. Clever, but no vision. 
DOCTOR: Professor, you have offered these people a very big sugar-coated pill to make them accept you, yes? 
ZAROFF: I turned their dreams and prophecies to my own means. 
DOCTOR: The dreams of a people living on a drowned continent must be. 
ZAROFF: To lift Atlantis from the ocean. Make it dry land again. 
DOCTOR: Exactly. But now, how are you going to do it? Even a genius like you. 
ZAROFF: Look. Atlantis underwater. 
(Zaroff shows the Doctor a model of the city in an aquarium tank.) 
DOCTOR: A very large mass to lift. 
ZAROFF: If I can't lift it then I must lower the water level. You see the valve there? 
DOCTOR: Yes, may I? 
ZAROFF: Please. 
(The Doctor pulls the plug from the tank.)
ZAROFF: Simple, isn't it? 
DOCTOR: Yes, but you haven't got a drain big enough to take an ocean. 
ZAROFF: Then I will make one. 
DOCTOR: You'll forgive me. I'm a little lost. The crust of the Earth is more than a hundred miles thick. Below that is believed to be a white-hot molten core. Now where is your ocean going to go? 
ZAROFF: That is my secret. 
DOCTOR: Oh, now you're making fun of me, Professor. 
ZAROFF: No, no. 
DOCTOR: Even supposing you could drill to the depth of a hundred miles. 
ZAROFF: There is a place where a fissure reduces the distance to less than fifteen miles. 
DOCTOR: It's still an enormous obstacle. 
ZAROFF: But not insurmountable. We have been working on it for many years. 
DOCTOR: Even if. 
ZAROFF: Excuse me, I have been interrupted. 
(Holding up a bag of food, Zaroff returns to his pet octopus.) 
DOCTOR: But Professor? 
ZAROFF: Yes? 
DOCTOR: Even supposing you succeeded, you know what will happen, don't you? 
ZAROFF: You tell me, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Well, the water will be converted into superheated steam, the pressure will grow, and crack the crust of the Earth. Destroy all life, maybe even blow the planet apart. 
ZAROFF: Yes. And I shall have redeemed my promise to lift Atlantis from the sea. Lift it to the sky! It will be magnificent. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZAROFF: Bang! Bang! Bang, bang! That's all. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Just one small question. Why do you want to blow up the world? 
ZAROFF: Why? You, a scientist, ask me why? The achievement, my dear Doctor. The destruction of the world. The scientists' dream of supreme power!

[Mine]

(Deep below the city. The drills make a high pitched screech that hurts the ears.) 
FOREMAN: Only four loads today? You'll have to increase output or you'll be joining our fish friends. All right, get on with it. 
(A guard brings Jamie and Ben.) 
FOREMAN: I've another two for you. All right, this way, follow me. 
(They go over to where two workers are talking and not working.)  
FOREMAN: What's this? 
SEAN: Huh? 
FOREMAN: Slacking? 
SEAN: (Irish, of course) Oh, I'm sorry I can't hear a word you're saying. Splitting with the noise. 
FOREMAN: What have you got there? 
JACKO: Who, me? 
FOREMAN: Guard! 
(Jacko palms off a small object to Sean.) 
FOREMAN: Search that man. 
(Unseen, Sean throws it to Jamie, who hides it in his plaid.) 
GUARD: Nothing here. 
FOREMAN: Search the other. 
(Sean is ticklish, and giggles.) 
GUARD: Nothing on this one either. 
FOREMAN: All right, this time you're lucky. These two have just joined us. Teach them to be useful. 
(The foreman leaves with the guard.) 
JACKO: That was close. What is it? 
(Jamie gives it back to Sean.) 
BEN: What's the secret about a compass? 
SEAN: It's as important as eyes down here. Thanks, chum. If they had found that on us we'd have been for the high jump, I tell you. 
JAMIE: Why d'ye pass it on to me though? Suppose they'd caught me with it? 
SEAN: Well, they didn't, did they? 
BEN: Are you planning something, then? 
SEAN: That's our business. 
JAMIE: What's the matter with you? Are we not all in the same boat? 
JACKO: That's right, Jock, and we don't want no one to rock it. 
JAMIE: The name happens to be Jamie and I'll just thank you to 
SEAN: Take no notice, he's a bit like that, you see. 
BEN: Hey, watch it. That guard's looking this way. 
SEAN: Oh, well, make out we're working.

[Zaroff's laboratory]

(Zaroff his checking his assistant's work.) 
ZAROFF: Your calculations cannot be correct. Let me see. 
DAMON: Professor? 
ZAROFF: Not now, Damon. Come with me. 
DOCTOR: Ah, Mister Damon, you're back. Did your operation go well? 
DAMON: The girl escaped. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear. How very frustrating for you. 
DAMON: We'll get her back. 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes of course you will. 
(The Doctor goes to a workbench and examines the bottles of chemicals there.) 
DOCTOR: It's very important to you, isn't it? I mean, you want all the human labour you can get, don't you? 
DAMON: Yes. But it's cheap and plentiful. We pick up survivors from shipwrecks who would otherwise be corpses, and convert them to fish people. 
DOCTOR: Amazing. The Professor leads the field in scientific discoveries. What a fantastic conception. To control the world from a test tube. 
DAMON: That's right. 
DOCTOR: Well, two can play at that game. Have you ever seen this? 
(The Doctor picks up two test tubes and pours one into the other. It releases a gas and Damon starts coughing.) 
DAMON: Stop him, stop him. Don't let him get away.

[Temple of Amdo]

ARA: You understand, you must hide on Amdo and wait until I can fetch you. Don't be worried. 
POLLY: Yes, but. 
ARA: And don't make a sound. 
POLLY: No, all right. 
(Ara leaves, and Polly starts climbing the idol to find somewhere to hide.)

[Mine]

(It is time to eat - plankton again.) 
BEN: Don't you ever get sick of this seafood? 
JACKO: You learn to live with it. 
SEAN: Just watch it though, they haven't found any way of keeping it fresh. In a few hours it's putrid. 
JAMIE: Tell me, why do you need a compass? 
SEAN: Oh, there's no point in making a break without one, is there? 
JACKO: Why don't you shout it out to the guard? 
BEN: Look, mate, do yourself a favour and stop treating us as if we're one of them. Look, Jamie and I don't intend to stop here either. 
SEAN: See, I told you. Now come on boys, will you cheer up? 
JACKO: All right, all right. 
BEN: How do you intend going about it? 
JAMIE: Aye, how? There're guards all over. 
BEN: Well, come on, give. 
SEAN: Right. Well, while I was mining a shaft, I came along the entrance to a little underground tunnel like this, you see? 
BEN: I see. 
JAMIE: Where does it lead, though? 
SEAN: Well, we haven't been able to explore it. We'll just have to take a chance. Now if we go, there'll be no turning back. You understand? 
JACKO: We make it or we don't. 
SEAN: Are you with us, then? 
BEN: Yeah, count me in. 
JAMIE: Aye, when do we go? 
JACKO: When the chance comes. 
SEAN: And we jump fast, do y'hear me? 
(The Foreman comes over.) 
FOREMAN: They need extra labour up at the project. You two join the lineup for selection. 
(He moves away.) 
BEN: Now's our chance. We're off. 
SEAN: By Christopher, you're right. If we disappear now they'll think we're gone to the project work gang. Okay, Jacko? 
JACKO: Oh, it'll give us a start anyway. 
BEN: Right, now look, you go first, Jacko. That'll show Jamie and me where the entrance is. Then you go, Sean. 
JAMIE: And then you, then me. 
(A whistle sounds.) 
SEAN: Scatter. 
(The workers form a line, with Sean and Jacko at the far end. Then Jamie joins it.) 
FOREMAN: Right. You, you, you. 
JAMIE: How about me, sir? 
FOREMAN: You're too new. Get out of my way. 
(Jacko has already made his escape before the Foreman turns back to the line-up.) 
FOREMAN: You, you. 
BEN: I volunteer, sir. 
FOREMAN: Too new. 
BEN: Oh, but sir. 
FOREMAN: Go and join your friend. 
(Sean has used the distraction to leave too.) 
FOREMAN: You. 
(Jamie joins the line-up again to conceal Ben leaving.) 
FOREMAN: I thought I told you to get out of my way. 
JAMIE: Oh aye, sir, I'm just going, sir. (Jamie follows Ben.) Thanks, boys. 
(Jamie grabs a torch and goes around the miners to the secret tunnel where the others are waiting.)

[Tunnel]

BEN: Come on, man. We haven't got all day. 
JACKO: Took a long time, didn't he. 
BEN: Yeah. 
SEAN: Is that you? 
JAMIE: Aye. 
BEN: Well come on, hurry up. 
SEAN: And bring the light. 
JAMIE: All right. 
BEN: Look, suppose this don't lead any place, and we want to come back? 
SEAN: Oh, you won't mate. They'll kill runaway workers on sight.

[Corridor]

(The guards are searching for the Doctor and Polly.) 
GUARD: We'd better try the small chamber. 
(The guards move off and the Doctor comes out of a cupboard. He looks at the clothes inside it. They are guard uniforms. He tries on one of the hats.)

[Chamber]

GUARD: Nothing here. The compression chamber next. 
(Ara enters.) 
GUARD: Seen any strangers, girl? 
ARA: No, sir, nobody. 
(The guards leave and the Doctor enters.) 
DOCTOR: Ara? No, wait, Ara. It's me. 
ARA: Oh, it's you. 
DOCTOR: Where's Polly? 
ARA: Safe. I'm taking her some food and clothes. 
DOCTOR: Good girl, well done. Ara, where can I find your Chief of State? 
ARA: In the council chamber, why? 
DOCTOR: I want to talk to him. Can you take me to him? 
ARA: Yes, but he'll hand you over. 
DOCTOR: I'll have to take that risk. 
DAMON [OC]: Stay outside. 
(The Doctor and Ara hide behind a pillar as Ramo and Damon enter, leaving a guard outside the door.) 
DAMON: Keep your eyes skinned for escaped prisoners. 
RAMO: Well, where are the others now? 
DAMON: The two young men are at the mine. The girl is still at large, and so is the Doctor. But we'll find them. They cannot get away. 
RAMO: Now what does Zaroff think about it all? 
DAMON: Oh, he's furious, of course. Could upset his plans. 
RAMO: He should not have interfered with the temple sacrifice. 
DAMON: You've always hated him, Ramo. Why? 
RAMO: He's a destroyer. He appeals to all that is base in our people. He should never have come to Atlantis. 
DAMON: But without him, Atlantis will never rise again from the sea. 
DOCTOR: (sotto) Can you get Damon away? I want to talk to the priest alone. 
ARA: I'll try. 
(Ara comes out of hiding.) 
ARA: If you please? 
RAMO: But not to the same extent. 
ARA: Master? 
DAMON: Yes, yes? 
ARA: I believe I have seen the girl you are looking for. 
DAMON: Where? 
ARA: Down by the market. 
DAMON: Show me. 
(Ara and Damon leave, and the Doctor comes out.) 
DOCTOR: Can I have a word with you, Ramo? 
RAMO: Doctor! Damon! 
DOCTOR: We're both on the same side, Ramo. You distrust Zaroff out of instinct. I distrust him because I know the truth. 
RAMO: Why should I trust you? 
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. I wish I could think of a good answer. 
RAMO: All right, tell me what you know. 
DOCTOR: Can we talk here? 
RAMO: I know a place where we shan't be interrupted.

[Tunnel]

(The men come to a junction.) 
JACKO: Yeah, which way now? 
BEN: This-away, or thataway? 
SEAN: Oh, one is as good as the other. 
JAMIE: Well, let's try fifty paces up each tunnel, then turn back. 
BEN: Yeah. 
JAMIE: Jacko? Oh, I suppose I'll go with you. We'll take the high road. 
JACKO: Oh, let's go then. 
BEN: Which leaves us with 
BEN + SEAN: The low road.

[Temple of Amdo]

(Polly has fallen asleep in the shadows of the idol and doesn't wake as Ramo and the Doctor enter.) 
RAMO: Come this way. We shall not be interrupted here. Now, tell me what you found out about Zaroff. 
DOCTOR: He says that he's going to raise Atlantis, yes? That's not quite true. He intends to destroy Atlantis. 
RAMO: A difficult task. 
DOCTOR: It's easier than raising it. 
RAMO: How will he destroy us? 
DOCTOR: He intends to drill a hole through the earth's crust, and drain away the ocean, yes? 
RAMO: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Have you any idea what will happen if he does that? I'll show you. 
(The Doctor fills a small pot with water.) 
DOCTOR: May I? 
(He seals the lid and places it over a brazier.) 
DOCTOR: This pot is the earth. This is the ocean. The ocean drains into the earth. Now, but the centre of the earth is hot, far hotter than this fire. So what happens? 
RAMO: But this is child's play. What has this to do with Zaroff's project? 
DOCTOR: This pot is Zaroff's project. Watch. Now the pot begins to boil, but the steam can't get out, and so. I think we'd better stand a little further back. Get down! 
(Bang! As the pot blows apart under the pressure of the steam.) 
DOCTOR: This is what will happen. Zaroff intends to raise Atlantis, but in little pieces. 
RAMO: You swear this is true? 
DOCTOR: Well, I thought I might mention it. Of course, if you don't mind being blown up. 
RAMO: Can you stop him? 
DOCTOR: Could I? I am not the ruler of Atlantis. 
RAMO: If I took you to our ruler Thous, could you convince him? 
DOCTOR: I might. 
RAMO: Wait here. 
(Ramo leaves. The Doctor pulls out his recorder and plays.)

[Tunnel]

BEN + SEAN: Thirty eight, thirty nine, forty. 
BEN: Well, what beats me is why Atlantis hasn't been discovered before. 
SEAN: Oh, maybe it has, but nobody got back home to tell the tale. 
BEN: Oh yeah, could be. Hey. 
(They flatten themselves against the wall then jump out on a passing person.) 
JACKO: Hey! It's me. 
SEAN: I'm sorry. You can't be too careful these days. 
BEN: Yeah, but where's Jamie? He went with you. 
JACKO: He's gone on, I came back to collect you and Sean. 
BEN: Now what do we do. We're not even at the end of this one yet. 
SEAN: I think the best thing to do is you go back to Jamie ,and I'll go on and meet you in ten minutes. 
BEN: Oh yeah, but where? 
SEAN: Where? At the, er, at the fork. Okay? 
BEN: Right.

[Temple of Amdo]

(Ramo returns.) 
RAMO: Put this on, could you? 
(He gives the Doctor a cloak.) 
DOCTOR: Could I? 
RAMO: With these robes, no one will challenge you. 
(The Doctor is very taken with the headdress.) 
DOCTOR: How do I look? 
RAMO: What? 
DOCTOR: Never mind.

[Tunnel ledge]

BEN: Jamie! 
JAMIE [OC]: Here. 
BEN: Jamie! 
JAMIE: Down here! 
(Jamie is below them, hanging on for grim death to an outcrop of rock.) 
BEN: Okay, mate. We're with you. Are you hurt? 
JAMIE: No, but watch it. The rock's slippery. 
BEN: Don't worry about us. Just cling on. 
SEAN: How far down is he? 
BEN: About ten feet, I'd say. 
SEAN: What's that in metres? 
BEN: Why don't you get further along there. (Ben lies down and tries to reach out to Jamie.) 
BEN: Can you reach it? Try again. Right. Now the other hand. 
(Jamie moves his weight to his other hand and manages to reach Ben's fingers. Jacko hangs onto Ben's legs as he reaches down with his other hand. As Jamie grabs it, the extra weight makes Ben slide forward.) 
BEN: Oh, Jacko! 
JAMIE: I think I've got a foothold now. 
BEN: All right. 
(But he can't climb up, so Ben and Jacko have to pull Jamie onto the ledge.)

[Temple of Amdo]

(Polly wakes and climbs down the idol.) 
POLLY: Huh. You needn't think I'm afraid of you, you stupid thing. 
(A hidden door opens in the base of the statue and she hides in the shadows.) 
SEAN: Come on, quietly. 
BEN: Blimey, look where we are. 
JAMIE: Back at the temple. 
SEAN: There's somebody down there. 
POLLY: Boo. 
BEN: Ah, it's Polly! All right. 
JAMIE: Polly! 
JACKO: You know her? 
BEN: Yeah, of course I do. She's one of our lot. 
POLLY: What happened to you? 
BEN: We found a tunnel in the mines that lead into this idol. 
JAMIE: So here we are. 
BEN: What's this rigout in aid of? 
POLLY: They were going to turn me into a fish. 
BEN: Into a fish? 
POLLY: It's not funny! 
SEAN: I'm Sean, this is Jacko. 
JAMIE: Have you seen the Doctor? 
POLLY: Not since he went off with Professor Zaroff. Why, haven't you? 
BEN: No, but I'd love to know what he's up to.

[Council chamber]

DOCTOR: Ramo, this ruler of yours, is he 
RAMO: His name is Thous. He believes Zaroff to be the deliverer of Atlantis. 
(Thous enters.) 
THOUS: Good evening, Brothers of the Temple. Please be seated. What is this important business you want to tell me about? 
RAMO: Most excellent Thous, this is a matter of life and death. Under no other circumstances would I have brought a stranger to you in temple garb. 
THOUS: A stranger? Who are you? 
DOCTOR: A man of science. 
THOUS: Science? Ah, I see. One of Professor Zaroff's colleagues. Perhaps we should ask him to join us. 
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, I wouldn't do that if I were you. In fact, I wanted to speak to you alone, Excellency. 
(Ramo moves away.) 
THOUS: Well, speak. 
DOCTOR: Excellency, the Professor is a wonderful man. 
THOUS: Wonderful? 
DOCTOR: A worker of miracles. 
THOUS: Indeed, you speak the truth. 
DOCTOR: But, have you noticed his eyes lately? 
THOUS: No. 
DOCTOR: When he talks of his project, have you noticed his eyes? They light up like this! 
THOUS: What does this mean? 
DOCTOR: The Professor is as mad as a hatter. 
THOUS: Mad? Zaroff? 
DOCTOR: Completely. No answer. It's sad. 
THOUS: I do not understand. 
RAMO: We believe Zaroff to be working toward the destruction of Atlantis, not it's resurrection. 
THOUS: I have heard such words from you before, Ramo. 
RAMO: This man has proved it to me. Zaroff's plan will split the world in two. This is not the action of a sane man. 
THOUS: But your own priests proclaimed him to be the prophet who would raise us above the sea. 
RAMO: Lolem. He is old and superstitious. 
THOUS: And your superior, Ramo. Remember that! 
DOCTOR: So you will not listen to us? 
THOUS: I did not say that. I have heard your arguments. 
DOCTOR: We've only just begun. 
THOUS: I have heard enough. Now leave me, and I will consider what you have said. 
RAMO: I know you will choose well, for all our sakes.

[Temple of Amdo]

ARA: Oh, I'm sorry I'm so long. Here's some food. 
JAMIE: Ah, food. 
POLLY: And clothing. Super. Thanks, Ara. Look at this! Listen, why are you doing all this for us? 
ARA: You were kind to me, and I hate Zaroff. 
JAMIE: You hate Zaroff? 
ARA: We are not all his slaves. He will find out one day. 
SEAN: Let's hope we find out soon. Do you want all that food for yourself, Ben? Come on.
BEN: Oh, sorry. Look, Ara, have you seen anything of the Doctor? 
ARA: Yes, I'll take you to him later. 
BEN: What's that? 
ARA: Oh, quickly, you must hide. They're coming. 
JAMIE: Back where we came from, Ben. 
BEN: Right, the safest place in the whole of Atlantis. 
SEAN: There's no need to be afraid, girl. 
(Ara looks at the idol in fear.) 
POLLY: Aren't you coming with us, Ara? 
ARA: No, I must stay here. I'll be missed. 
JAMIE: Are you two going to remain here all night? Come on. 
(Ara slips away as the four go into the hidden chamber.)

[Council chamber]

(The Doctor and Ramo are summoned.) 
THOUS: I have given much thought to your words, and I have come to a decision. There is your answer. 
(The doors are thrown open to admit Zaroff and his guards.) 
THOUS: Do with them what you will!

Episode Three

(From the Lost in Time DVD)

[Thous' room]

ZAROFF: So you're just a little man after all, Doctor, like all the rest. You disappoint me. 
DOCTOR: You disappoint me, Professor. I didn't think a man of science needed the backing of thugs. 
ZAROFF: Have a care, Doctor. Your life is in the balance. 
DOCTOR: What, you mean you haven't told your own people what's in store for them? Are you afraid, Zaroff? 
ZAROFF: I have made a mistake. If I had not interfered with the temple sacrifice, the sharks would have torn you apart. But it's not too late. I'll return you to Lolem and tell him I need you no longer. And he can have that stupid priest as makeweight. 
DOCTOR: No. You've no quarrel with Ramo. I persuaded him to help me. I'm the one to blame. 
RAMO: That is not true. I have always distrusted you, Zaroff. 
ZAROFF: Take them away! 
RAMO: The curse of Amdo be on you! 
ZAROFF: Goodbye, Doctor. Have a pleasant journey. 
DOCTOR: Let's not say goodbye, Professor. We'll be seeing each other again. 
ZAROFF: Not in this world, Doctor. 
(The Doctor and Ramo are taken away.) 
ZAROFF: As always, there is nothing to worry about. 
THOUS: And there is no truth in this man's arguments? 
ZAROFF: The man is a fool. Have I not sworn to you that Atlantis shall rise again from the sea? Haven't I? Haven't I? What are you staring at? 
(Thous is looking into Zaroff's eyes.) 
THOUS: Nothing. Nothing at all.

[Temple of Amdo].

(The priests enter in their seaweed robes. The Doctor and Ramo are stood before two beheading blocks.) 
DOCTOR: What happens now? 
RAMO: First the supplication, and then 
(He looks at a masked man with a large sword.) 
LOLEM: Accept, oh powerful and mighty Amdo, these your sacrifices. 
DOCTOR: I'm sorry I got you into this, Ramo. 
RAMO: We all have to die sometime, Doctor. If it is the will of Amdo, it is inevitable. 
(Their necks are forced down onto the blocks. But just as the headsman raises his sword, a shrieking sound comes from the mouth of the idol. Everyone stops and stares.) 
VOICE: This is the voice of Amdo. Hear me. Bow down your heads that Amdo may accept your sacrifice. Bow. Let no human eyes witness this awful moment. 
(All but the Doctor kow tow.) 
DOCTOR: (sotto) I know that voice. 
(The secret door opens and Ben beckons to the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: (sotto) Ramo. Don't be afraid. Get up and follow me. Come on. 
(They run forward and duck behind the altar as Lolem looks up.) 
VOICE: He who looks on the living face of Amdo shall die. 
(The Doctor and Ramo get inside the secret door. The idol screams again.) 
LOLEM: A miracle! A great and powerful miracle! Amdo has eaten up her victims!

[Secret room]

RAMO: Unbelievable. All these years and I never guessed Amdo's secret. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I thought I recognised the voice. How on Earth did you manage it? 
POLLY: This is linked to the back of Amdo's mouth. It's a bit old but it works. 
DOCTOR: It was the sweetest sound I've ever heard in me life. 
POLLY: Thanks, Doctor. 
BEN: Keep your voices down now, or they'll hear us. 
POLLY: No, they won't, I've put the bunghole in. 
RAMO: So Amdo was made to trick her worshipers. 
DOCTOR: Ben, how did you find this place? 
BEN: Oh, we found it by chance. A tunnel in the mines leads straight here. 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
JAMIE: Doctor. That's Sean, that's Jacko. 
(It turns out that Sean is blond and Jacko is dark-skinned.)

[Council chamber].

ZAROFF: So I tell you, it's complete. Everything will be ready in two days from now. 
THOUS: To think that after so long the great day is at hand. We shall surprise the whole of mankind. 
ZAROFF: Yes. A very great surprise. Perhaps the greatest ever. 
THOUS: I shall order special prayers today. 
ZAROFF: Why not? It will keep the people happy. 
LOLEM [OC]: Let me in! 
THOUS: What is the meaning of this, exalted Lolem? 
LOLEM: A miracle, mighty Thous, before our very eyes! 
ZAROFF: Tell us. 
LOLEM: Mighty Amdo, goddess of land and sea, has accepted the sacrifice of the priest, and the little Doctor. 
ZAROFF: Indeed. What a miracle. 
LOLEM: They vanished into air before they could be beheaded. 
ZAROFF: No. Disappeared, you say? How? 
LOLEM: They were in our midst and we bowed our heads in prayer. When we looked again they'd gone. 
ZAROFF: You lie, Priest. You allowed them to escape, no? 
THOUS: You discredit the mystic power of Amdo? 
ZAROFF: I believe what I see with my own eyes. 
THOUS: The truth, Lolem. 
RAMO: I tell you, the voice of Amdo spoke to us. 
ZAROFF: Ha. 
LOLEM: The little Doctor no longer lives. 
THOUS: You're certain? 
LOLEM: By the spirit of Amdo, by the all-beating heart of living Atlantis. 
THOUS: Perhaps he is right. It is a miracle. You may go. 
ZAROFF: Yes, go. And pray to Amdo that you are right. 
LOLEM: May the wrath of Amdo engulf you! 
ZAROFF: I'll take my chance. Get out! 
(Lolem leaves.) 
THOUS: Is it wise to sow seeds of doubt by discrediting a miracle just now? 
ZAROFF: Yes. If the Doctor is at large, he can be an even bigger danger. We must search the whole of Atlantis for him. 
THOUS: But Lolem has said 
ZAROFF: Maybe Lolem can raise Atlantis again from the sea with his prayers? 
THOUS: Give your orders, Zaroff. It shall be as you wish. 
ZAROFF: Now you are talking sense again.

[Secret room].

POLLY: The point is, where do we go from here? 
BEN: Yeah, where? 
JAMIE: Aye, tell us, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Our course is plain. We must attack Zaroff. He has gone mad, and he's bent on destroying the whole world. We've only a short while in which to stop him. 
SEAN: Well, just tell us what to do. 
DOCTOR: Food. 
SEAN: You're hungry, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Hmm? 
SEAN: Hungry? 
DOCTOR: No, I mean Zaroff and his people cannot exist without food. 
RAMO: But there's always plenty of food for everyone. The sea is all around us. The supplies are unlimited. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but who provides it? 
RAMO: The fish people do. 
DOCTOR: The fish people! Exactly. And why? Because they are slaves. But slaves, like worms, can be made to turn. 
POLLY: Right. So if you organise the fish people to cut off the supplies. Yes, but that's no good. Then they'll just go and live off their stocks. 
DOCTOR: Tell them, Ramo. 
RAMO: We have no stocks of food. 
DOCTOR: Exactly. Zaroff has not yet found the answer to his great problem. All his seafood goes bad in a few hours, and has to be thrown away. 
RAMO: That's true. 
DOCTOR: And so 
BEN: I get it, we get the fish people to go on strike. 
JACKO: Oh, you are dreaming, man. 
SEAN: Now hold on a minute, we could try right enough. 
POLLY: Yes, but what would that do for us? 
DOCTOR: What would it do for us? I don't know, really, but it's a start. Do you think you can do it? 
SEAN: Well, we'll have a go, Doctor, but it'll take a great gift of the gab to win over the fish people, you know? 
DOCTOR: But you are Irish. 
SEAN: Well, come on, laughing boy. Tell me, how can we contact you? 
DOCTOR: We make this place our headquarters. If nobody's here, just leave a message. 
POLLY: Good luck. 
JACKO: Oh, we'll need it. 
(Jacko and Sean leave.) 
BEN: What are we going to do? 
DOCTOR: Kidnap Professor Zaroff!

[Market]

(Polly and Ara look around the fish people's market. Polly is in local clothes now, a sea-shell bodice and seaweed skirt, and decorative headdress. The Doctor has a headscarf and cloak, and playing his recorder, rather like a gypsy.) 
DOCTOR: Are you all right? 
POLLY: Yes, super. Look what I've got on. 
DOCTOR: You look splendid. 
POLLY: Better than you do. Couldn't you find a better disguise than that? 
DOCTOR: What's wrong with it? 
POLLY: You look like a sailor. 
DOCTOR: That's what I'm supposed to be. 
(A fish woman comes past with a large basket.) 
POLLY: No, thank you. 
(Polly takes a drink from a fountain.) 
POLLY: Salt water. 
DOCTOR: What do you expect? This is Atlantis. Now you know what to do? 
POLLY: I think so. 
DOCTOR: Wait a minute. Something's gone wrong. Where's Zaroff? 
POLLY: Looking for us. 
(Guards come through the market. Ara conceals Polly as they try to avoid them.) 
ARA: Back this way. Nola, we need your help. 
NOLA: (a stall holder) Guards? 
POLLY: They're looking for me. 
NOLA: Lie down. 
(She covers Polly with a rug and Ara sits on her.) 
GUARD: Have you seen any strangers about, old woman? 
NOLA: Everyone's a stranger these days. Why don't they stay away and leave us in peace? 
GUARD: What have you got here? 
(Another guard goes to jab the rug with his trident. Nola grabs it.) 
NOLA: How shall I sell my carpets if you stick holes in them? 
(The guards leave.) 
NOLA: It's clear. 
ARA: Are you all right? 
POLLY: Yes. Thank you very much. 
NOLA: Don't waste time, girl. Get away while you're safe. 
(Polly and Ara leave. The Doctor rattles his tambourine and sits by the fountain. Jamie and Ben enter in wetsuits, like Zaroff's guards wear.) 
JAMIE: Zaroff's on his way, close behind us. 
BEN: Hey! Did you see anyone come through the market place? 
DOCTOR: A man? 
BEN: Yes. 
DOCTOR: About five foot nine? 
BEN: That's right. 
DOCTOR: Black coat, baggy trousers and a bow tie? 
BEN: Exactly. 
(A guard walks straight past.) 
DOCTOR: No. As a matter of fact I haven't. 
BEN: You fool. 
JAMIE: He's gone. We'd better get in position. 
BEN: Right. 
DOCTOR: Polly! 
(Ara takes the Doctor's place at the fountain.) 
ZAROFF: Where's that man who has been a moment ago? 
ARA: What man, sir? 
ZAROFF: Answer me, girl. 
ARA: I don't know. 
ZAROFF: Guard! Search over there. 
GUARD: Sir! 
ZAROFF: You two come with me. 
(Ben and Jamie give nazi salutes and follow Zaroff.) 
DOCTOR: Zaroff! 
ZAROFF: There he is! There he is! Stop that man! 
DOCTOR: Zaroff! 
(Mayhem as everyone runs around. The Doctor runs out with Zaroff, Ben and Jamie following him.)

[Passageway]

ZAROFF: That man, which way did he go? 
(Polly keeps her face down and points along the passageway. She joins in the train behind Jamie.)

[Temple of Amdo].

RAMO: Is all well? 
DOCTOR: Splendid. He's close behind me. I hope I haven't set too hot a pace for him. No. Here he comes. 
(Ramo kneels in front of the idol as the Doctor hides. Zaroff enters with Ben and Jamie.) 
ZAROFF: He must be here somewhere. Search the temple. 
BEN: Yeah. 
ZAROFF: Who has entered here, priest? Ah, the renegade priest himself. Guards, take him! 
(Zaroff pushes Ramo into the arms of Ben and Jamie. He finds the Doctor behind a pillar.) 
ZAROFF: Ah, Doctor, at last. 
(The Doctor blows powder into his face from a blowpipe. Ben and Jamie pounce.) 
BEN: Right, to the back with him. 
ZAROFF: Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! 
POLLY: Doctor, now that you've got him, what are you going to do with him? 
DOCTOR: You'll see. Come on. 
(They all go into the secret chamber behind the idol.)

[Cliffside]

(Fish people are relaxing on the rocks, looking like Galapagos iguanas.) 
JACKO: Go on, tell them. 
SEAN: Tell them what? I tell them nothing. They're not people like us, they're just a bunch of sardines. You heard me. Cold-blooded fishes. You haven't got a drop of good red blood in your body. 
(The fish people don't like that.) 
SEAN: A flatfish from Galway would have more guts in them than that bunch. 
(The fish people throw pebbles and shells.) 
SEAN: (laughs) You wouldn't hurt a little child. 
JACKO: What would they do? 
SEAN: I'll tell them. All right, all right, all right. Oh, calm down and listen. Listen, will you? Look, you supply all the food for Atlantis, right? It can't be stored, right? It goes rotten in a couple of hours. That's why Zaroff has you working like slaves night and day, right? Well, has it never occurred to your little fish brains to stop that supply of food? Feed yourselves but starve Atlantis, eh? What do you think would happen then? Well now is your chance. Will you do it, or will you stay fish slaves for the rest of your lives? You're men, aren't you? Well, start the blockade right now. 
JACKO: Do you reckon they will do it? 
SEAN: Who knows? We can only hope for the best. 
(The word is spread underwater.)

[Secret chamber]

ZAROFF: I have underrated you, Doctor. I hardly imagined you would have the nerve to kidnap Zaroff himself. 
BEN: What's so funny? 
JAMIE: Aye, what? 
POLLY: I don't see what you've got to laugh at. 
ZAROFF: Dear lady, if you wish to stop my plans, you are all too late. 
RAMO: Too late? 
ZAROFF: The process has started. My nuclear reactor is activated, and when the desired figure is reached, fission will take place, and none of all this will matter for any of us. 
DOCTOR: He's only bluffing. Nothing can start without him. 
ZAROFF: Ah, Doctor, how do you know that? 
DOCTOR: Simple. The great Zaroff would have to be there to set off the explosion. Miss your big moment? I think not. 
ZAROFF: You cannot hold me. My guards will 
RAMO: Will never find you. Not inside the temple you have defiled, Zaroff. 
ZAROFF: You are fools! Idiots! I am mightier than all of you. If I, if 
(Zaroff collapses.) 
POLLY: Doctor? 
JAMIE: It's a ruse. 
POLLY: What's the matter with him? 
DOCTOR: Some sort of attack. 
BEN: That stopped him. The project won't be able to go ahead now, will it? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. We'd better make sure. 
JAMIE: What would you do? 
DOCTOR: Get inside that laboratory. 
JAMIE: Then I'm coming with you. 
BEN: Yeah, me too. 
DOCTOR: No, somebody's got to stay here to look after Zaroff. 
POLLY: I, I'll stay. 
JAMIE: You can't bide here by yourself. 
RAMO: I'll stay with her. 
DOCTOR: Very well. Come on. Quick. 
POLLY: Take care. 
BEN: Yeah.

[Temple of Amdo]

BEN: Not another service? 
DOCTOR: This is likely to take some time. 
JAMIE: Could we not just slip out? 
DOCTOR: I don't think so. Better duck down here. 
(They hide behind the altar.)

[Secret chamber]

POLLY: It doesn't seem possible, does it? 
RAMO: What? 
POLLY: Well, look at him. He doesn't look very menacing now, does he? 
RAMO: There is still evil in this man. It hangs over him like a shroud. You will pay dearly for your crimes, Zaroff. 
ZAROFF: I know, I know. But before I die, priest, you must help me to pray to your god for atonement. 
RAMO: Why should I help you? 
ZAROFF: Have pity on me. At least help me stand at your side so I may feel the aura of your goodness. 
POLLY: I think you should. He does look very ill. 
RAMO: It's more than you deserve, Zaroff. But for the blessing of Amdo I will grant you this last request. 
(Ramo helps Zaroff up, and Zaroff starts strangling him. Ramo throws him off and grabs a sword. He jabs at Zaroff but Zaroff grabs it and presses it against Ramo's throat.) 
ZAROFF: And now, meddling priest, this is the end of you. 
(Zaroff throws Ramo down and makes to stab him in the back. Polly tries to intervene.) 
POLLY: Don't! Stop it! 
(Zaroff throws her off and kills Ramo. Polly screams.) 
ZAROFF: You will come with me. 
(He takes her into the tunnel.)

[Temple of Amdo]

(The Doctor, Ben and Jamie peer over the altar wearing fish masks. The celebrants are leaving.) 
BEN: Who'd have thought it would take that long. 
JAMIE: Let's get started. 
BEN: Yeah, quick. 
DOCTOR: Just a minute, I've had a thought. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: Jamie, you'd better watch Zaroff. 
JAMIE: Why? 
DOCTOR: Well, we need a guide, and only Ramo knows all the passages. 
JAMIE: Oh, if you say so, Doctor. 
(Ramo staggers out of the secret chamber.) 
JAMIE: Doctor, look! 
RAMO: Zaroff. 
DOCTOR: Come on. Come on. 
(They help Ramo down the steps and lay him down while Jamie goes to check on Polly.) 
BEN: Is he? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
BEN: Zaroff was having us on. 
JAMIE: Polly's gone. 
DOCTOR: Zaroff's taken her as a hostage. 
BEN: Well, let's go! 
DOCTOR: No, Ben. Jamie, you go after Polly. Only watch out. Zaroff's a desperate man. 
JAMIE: Right. 
DOCTOR: Ben, you and I have other fish to fry. Come on.

[Tunnel]

(Zaroff is dragging Polly along by a rope tied around her wrists.) 
POLLY: Oh, wait. I can't go on any more. 
ZAROFF: You will go on if I have to drag you. Wait. Did you hear anything? 
POLLY: No, nothing. 
ZAROFF: Come on. 
POLLY: No. 
ZAROFF: Do you want the same treatment as the priest? 
POLLY: No. 
ZAROFF: Come. 
JAMIE: Polly? 
(Polly pulls the rope out of Zaroff's hands and runs to Jamie.) 
ZAROFF: Wait. Come back here. Come back, I warn you. 
(Round a corner Jamie starts to untie Polly.) 
ZAROFF: Ah! 
(The nimble Jamie avoids Zaroff's attacks. Polly hits him on the head with a rock and he turns so Jamie can jump on his back.) 
POLLY: Jamie! 
(Zaroff throws Jamie off. Sean and Jacko arrive. Sean yells.) 
ZAROFF: Go back. Go back. 
(Zaroff grabs Polly then throws her into Jamie's arms as he runs off, laughing.) 
JAMIE: He's away. 
POLLY: Jamie, quickly, we've got to go and warn the Doctor. 
JAMIE: Aye, the Doctor's going to find a heap of trouble if Zaroff gets back there first. 
JACKO: How do we find the laboratory? 
POLLY: Ara, she's the only one we know who knows the way. Now you go back to the temple and we'll go and find her.

[Council chamber]

DAMON: The slaves are in revolt. They've cut off all food supplies. 
THOUS: I cannot understand it. Why do they act like this when the hour of triumph is at hand? 
DAMON: They're just slaves, what can you expect? 
THOUS: Where is Zaroff? He should be here to attend to this. 
DAMON: Disappeared. 
THOUS: Disappeared? He can't have. Go and look for him. 
DAMON: There is no time, Excellency. You must take control now. 
THOUS: So be it. I cannot let my people starve. Bring them before me that I may hear their demands. 
DAMON: Yes, great Thous, I will tell them. 
(Damon leaves.) 
THOUS: All-wise, all-seeing Amdo, help me now. 
(Zaroff enters with two of his guards.) 
THOUS: Zaroff! Where have you been? We've been looking for you. The workers are in revolt. 
ZAROFF: My guards will restore order. 
THOUS: They are simple people. I'm sure they will 
ZAROFF: Those who resist will be killed. 
THOUS: Killed? 
ZAROFF: I have no time to waste. 
THOUS: Zaroff, you are subject to me in all matters. I will not have my people 
ZAROFF: Your people? Your people? They are my people now. I hold their whole world in my power. 
THOUS: The Doctor was right about you. I order your project stopped at this moment. Guards! Take Zaroff to the temple and hold him there. 
(Zaroff signals his own guards to stop the Atlanteans.) 
ZAROFF: You're a fool. You're a fool! I'll send you to your beloved goddess Amdo to discuss the future of the universe with her. 
THOUS: I demand that you 
ZAROFF: You? You demand? You demand? Well since your, since your beloved goddess has developed such an enchanting appetite for people, it is only fitting that the great Thous should offer himself. No, no, I shall offer him. 
(Zaroff takes a pistol from under his cloak and shoots Thous.) 
ZAROFF: Kill those two men. Nothing in the world can stop me now!

Episode Four

[Council chamber]

(A little later, Ben and the Doctor enter.) 
BEN: Doctor, look at this! Someone's been having a right punch-up in here. 
DOCTOR: It's the governor. It's Thous. 
BEN: Is he all right? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. Doesn't seem to have hit anything vital. 
BEN: Doesn't look too good, though. 
DOCTOR: Neither would you with a bullet in you. 
BEN: If we don't stop Zaroff soon, we'll all be for the chop. 
DOCTOR: I know. Come on, we must get him to safety. 
BEN: Well, then what? 
DOCTOR: To the generating station.

[Secret chamber]

JACKO: Are you sure the Doctor said we are to meet here? 
ARA: He must come back soon. 
SEAN: Well, if he's not back in five minutes we move on, okay? 
JACKO: Oh, where to, if the whole world is going to blow up in a couple of hours? 
SEAN: You're a great comfort to have around, did anyone ever tell you that? 
ARA: Look out. 
DOCTOR: Here we are. Careful. Anyone at home? 
ARA: Oh, Doctor! Oh, what's wrong? 
BEN: He's wounded, but don't worry, Ara, he'll be all right. 
DOCTOR: Where's Polly and Jamie? 
ARA: They've gone to Zaroff's laboratory. 
DOCTOR: Why? 
ARA: To look for you. I showed them which way to go and then they told me to come back here and wait. 
DOCTOR: We'll have to find them. Now, listen everyone. I have a plan. 
SEAN: Good. 
DOCTOR: It might even work. 
SEAN: Well? 
DOCTOR: Our one hope of stopping Zaroff is to flood all this lower part of Atlantis. 
BEN: But that means in here. 
DOCTOR: Yes. The temple, and Zaroff's laboratory. 
SEAN: Yes, but will the water stop there? 
DOCTOR: Don't know. We'll have to take that chance. 
JACKO: Yeah, but the people here. 
DOCTOR: They'll have to be warned and moved to a higher level. That's your job and Sean's. 
SEAN: And you? 
DOCTOR: Ben and I will try and get into the generating station. We'll turn up the power on the reactor, break down the sea walls and flood the laboratory. There's only one thing that's worrying me. 
SEAN: What's that? 
DOCTOR: Can we all swim?

[Zaroff's laboratory]

MAN [OC]: Stabiliser station Z2 calling. Stabiliser station Z2 calling. Routine check. 
TECH: Control receiving. 
MAN [OC]: Stabilisers normal. Nothing to report. 
TECH: Thank you, station Z-2, report again at zero minus five. 
MAN [OC]: Will do. 
TECH: That's in another ten minutes. 
MAN 2 [OC]: Priority, priority. Reactor station Z3 calling. Reactor station Z3 calling. 
ZAROFF: Zaroff here. 
MAN 2 [OC]: Reading maximum. Gauges four, five and six steady. Gauge three fluctuating and unpredictable. 
ZAROFF: Bring in the reserve. 
MAN 2 [OC]: The reserve? But if that fails. 
ZAROFF: That is an order! Report back if the fault continues. 
MAN2 [OC]: Yes, Professor. 
ZAROFF: Nothing can go wrong now. Nothing must go wrong. 
MAN 3 [OC]: Emergency, power network control. 
ZAROFF: Zaroff here, what's the problem? 
MAN 3 [OC]: Station eleven is no longer operating, the workers have deserted. 
ZAROFF: Deserted? What's the matter with them? Where are they? 
MAN 3 [OC]: They're out looking for food. 
ZAROFF: Why? 
MAN 3 [OC]: The food supplies have not arrived and there's a rumour that we're facing starvation. They've all panicked. 
ZAROFF: And no reserves? 
MAN 3 [OC]: That's right. 
ZAROFF: Get them back at once. Send the guards after them. 
MAN 3 [OC]: I've had to bring the guards into the plant to prevent a complete breakdown. 
ZAROFF: Well, do the best you can. I get more men to you within the hour. Blast! Blast! Blast!

[Outside the generating station]

(There's an armed guard on duty. The Doctor and Ben stay out of sight.) 
BEN: A guard! How are we going to get past him? 
DOCTOR: We'll walk past him. 
BEN: What, in those trousers? 
DOCTOR: Oh, you think I look a bit conspicuous, do you? 
BEN: A bit, yeah. 
DOCTOR: Maybe you're right. I know. You're a guard, and I'm a prisoner, right? 
BEN: Right! 
DOCTOR: Now don't make a mess of it, there's a good chap. 
GUARD: Halt! 
BEN: Prisoner and escort for Professor Zaroff. 
GUARD: Password? 
BEN: Ay? 
GUARD: Password? 
BEN: Yeah, well, look it's all right for you giving me the old chat, mate, but I know nothing about passwords. I've been out chasing this burke all day. 
GUARD: Professor Zaroff's not here anyway. 
BEN: Well, I know that. My orders was to bring him here and wait. 
GUARD: That's all very well. How do I know he's a wanted man? 
BEN: Well, blimey, look at him. He ain't normal, is he? 
GUARD: Yes, I see what you mean. All right. 
(The guard lets them through.) 
DOCTOR: You don't know the password either! 
GUARD: It's Oscar. Get him out of here! 
BEN: Go on, get out! Thanks, mate. 
DOCTOR: Very well done, Ben, very well done. I'm not quite sure about that not being normal bit, but very well done. I couldn't have done better myself. 
BEN: Thanks. 
GUARD 2: Halt. Give the password. 
BEN: Oscar. 
GUARD: Pass, Oscar. 
DOCTOR: Come on, now. We've got little time.

[Power station]

(Ben sneaks up behind the lone engineer and knocks him out.) 
BEN: What now? 
DOCTOR: Cut those cables. 
(Ben gets to work. There is a huge flywheel in the middle of the room driving the main generator. It begins to falter and slow. The Doctor adjusts some control levers.) 
BEN: Do you know what you're doing? 
DOCTOR: Oh, what a question. Of course I don't! There's no rule against trying, is there? There. Now, Zaroff's laboratory. He should be feeling the effects of this little lot any time now.

[Tunnel]

JAMIE: There's a gap through here. 
POLLY: Oh, Jamie, I think we're lost. Are you sure this is the way Ara told us to come? 
JAMIE: Aye. All the tunnels look alike, though. 
POLLY: No, listen. We must be somewhere below Zaroff's power source. 
JAMIE: Aye, it's like the beating of the Devil's heart. 
POLLY: You're not far wrong. We'd better keep going. The laboratory can't be far away. 
JAMIE: Aye, but which way?

[Zaroff's laboratory]

ZAROFF: That reading must be wrong, you idiot. I'll check it myself. No, that's not possible. Come here. Look at that reading. That's all we need now, radiation leak. Where the Devil is it coming from?

[Tunnel ledge]

JAMIE: I told you, don't look down. 
POLLY: But Jamie, look. The wall down there. It's glowing. 
JAMIE: What is it? 
POLLY: It could be radiation. 
JAMIE: Well, what's that then? 
POLLY: Radiation? Well, it's. Oh, it's too difficult to explain. The walls are beginning to crumble. It's all that vibration. 
JAMIE: Let's see, the sea's on the other side of that wall. Now if that gives way. 
POLLY: Yes. 
JAMIE: There must be way up to higher ground. 
(The wall starts to crack and sea water begins to come in. Jamie and Polly get to the end of the ledge and run up the next tunnel.) 
POLLY: Must get breath. 
JAMIE: Lucky it's uphill. Take more time for the water to reach us. 
POLLY: What's that? 
JAMIE: It's given way. The sea's breaking through!

[Another tunnel]

(Sean and Jacko are carrying Thous on a stretcher, with Ara following.) 
SEAN: Will you listen to that. 
JACKO: What is it? 
SEAN: How would I know, but it certainly isn't closing time at Betty Murphy's pub. It can be only one thing. It's the Doctor, of course. He's started to flood Atlantis. The sea's breaking in. 
THOUS: To raise Atlantis from the sea was only the dream of a madman after all. 
ARA: Rest. Don't speak. 
JACKO: Aye, rest. 
SEAN: And you best forget about all that now and look to the future. That is, if we're going to have any future. 
(The lower levels of the city are flooding. The torrent breaks the idol in the temple.) 
SEAN: Well, personally speaking, not being a terribly good swimmer myself, I think I'll just start to make a move. 
JACKO: Ah, we've got a visitor. 
SEAN: Oh Damon, you got my warning then. 
DAMON: My operating room. A life's work, washed away. 
THOUS: Damon. 
DAMON: Thous. 
THOUS: We can start again, Damon. 
SEAN: Look, if we don't hurry and get onto high ground above water level, we're going to be turned into fish food. 
DAMON: Yes, you're right. Quite so. I'll help. We've got a long way to go yet. 
SEAN: Come on, Jacko, up. Gently now. That's it.

[Tunnel].

POLLY: Oh, no! It's a dead end. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
POLLY: Jamie, we must go back. We've got to warn the others. There must be another turning. 
JAMIE: No, I kept an eye open for one on the way up. Besides, would you listen to that water. 
POLLY: We've got to get out of here somehow. 
(Jamie raises his candle to look, and the flame gutters.) 
JAMIE: Do you see that? There's a draught. Right, that's what we'll follow. I'll go first, and you stay close behind me.

[Mountain cave]

(Damon sets up a first aid station, high above the city. Refugees are huddling here.) 
DAMON: Artificial respiration. Your wound? 
THOUS: A little better. How is my poor country? 
DAMON: The water has already flooded the lower parts of the city. 
THOUS: The great enemy, which we held at bay for so many centuries, the ever-lasting nightmare is here at last. 
DAMON: Rescue parties are being organised. All passages have been blocked except the main shaft. We're keeping that open till the last to give the stragglers a chance. 
THOUS: What of Lolem the priest? 
DAMON: Well, last seen he was going towards the temple to seek aid from Amdo. 
THOUS: He is lost then. 
SEAN: We may still find them. Are you all right there? 
DAMON: You look after yourself. 
SEAN: Oh, hey Jacko? Any luck? 
JACKO: What do you expect? They must have all been drowned. 
SEAN: Ah, well. Probably a better death than the one that's in store for us when Zaroff lets off his explosion.

[Zaroff's laboratory]

ZAROFF: No one, I repeat, no one will leave his place. Everything goes according to schedule, except that the time of the big detonation has been advanced. The whole project will be activated from this control point. That is all until zero minus five. 
(The Doctor and Ben enter.) 
ZAROFF: Now we must connect you. 
DOCTOR: Good day to you. I hope I'm not too late. 
ZAROFF: There is the man who has been trying to sabotage all our plans. Make sure he doesn't leave us now. 
DOCTOR: Oh, how very nice of you, but I'm afraid I've interrupted something important, haven't I? Oh, yes, I can see that I have. You were on the point of exploding your firecracker, weren't you? 
(Zaroff laughs.) 
DOCTOR: I hope you've let these gentlemen into your big secret. 
ZAROFF: They share everything with me. 
DOCTOR: Naturally. They can't help themselves, can they? They must be devoted to you, to allow you to blow them all to pieces! 
TECH: You what? What's he talking about, Professor? 
DOCTOR: Oh, have I dropped a brick? Oh, I seem to have shaken some of them. Zaroff, I think you ought to know the sea has broken through and is about to overwhelm us here. 
ZAROFF: Don't listen to him. The man lies. 
DOCTOR: Then perhaps the distant roaring that we can hear is just the goddess Amdo with the indigestion? 
TECH: He's right. Come on! 
ZAROFF: Don't be alarmed. Don't be fooled. Ah, they're cowards, traitors. But it doesn't matter. 
DOCTOR: Time is running out, Zaroff. Hadn't you better call it a day? 
ZAROFF: You cannot beat me, Doctor. 
(Zaroff turns a control and a portcullis descends cutting him and his control panel off from the rest of the room.) 
ZAROFF: You see, I have anticipated every situation. There was always a possibility that someone would try to keep me from my ultimate moment of triumph. Now no one can get through this, and all the controls are on this side. Now all I must do is press the plunger when the needle of that dial is over the thousand mark. Simple, no? I tell you, so that you may share the last, great experiment of Zaroff! 
BEN: He's off his rocker. 
DOCTOR: I know. I've got to get him out of there. Come over here. I've got an idea. 
ZAROFF: Don't go away, Doctor. You will die just the same. You might as well stay and watch me.

[Tunnel].

(Jamie has climbed up the rock face to find the source of the breeze.) 
JAMIE: Hold the candle. Oh, would you be careful? 
POLLY: Sorry, I didn't do it on purpose. 
JAMIE: Right. 
POLLY: Any luck? 
JAMIE: Aye, there's a wee hole down there. I can't see where it leads to though. But if you're willing to take a chance? 
POLLY: Do we have a choice? 
(He pulls her up and they crawl on.) 
POLLY: Only just in time. 
JAMIE: Aye, we're not out of the woods yet.

[Zaroff's laboratory]

BEN: Doctor, I've got to go. The water's nearly here. 
ZAROFF: I see you have your deserters, too, Doctor. That leaves just you and me. 
DOCTOR: All right, Ben. 
BEN: Goodbye. 
ZAROFF: Young fool. I will press the plunger long before the water gets here. The result will be the same. 
DOCTOR: I know. But it's much more exciting in the dark. 
(The Doctor pulls out the lighting cables.) 
ZAROFF: Doctor, you are a comedian. 
(Zaroff draws his pistol and raises the portcullis. The lights come back on again.) 
ZAROFF: You see. Keep very still, Doctor. We have an emergency system here. You have solved nothing. Now unfortunately I have to tie you up. Turn around. 
(Ben has returned, and he lowers the portcullis, rolling underneath it as it falls. Zaroff is cut off from the control panel.) 
ZAROFF: No! No! You cannot do this to me! 
(Zaroff fires his pistol wildly as the Doctor and Ben get away.) 
ZAROFF: No! No! No! 
(Zaroff tries to reach through the portcullis to the controls, but the plunger is just out of reach.)

[Tunnel]

BEN: Doctor, hurry. Now what's the matter? 
DOCTOR: Ben, I've been thinking. I can't leave Zaroff to drown down there. I'm going back for him. 
BEN: But why on Earth? We've got to get out of here quick or we'll be cut off! 
DOCTOR: But we can't leave him there. 
BEN: Look, you're coming with me.

[Tunnel cave]

POLLY: Oh, it's no use, Jamie, I'll never make it. 
JAMIE: Course you can. One wee slope and we're away. 
POLLY: And another and another and another. It's no use, I won't, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Come on. 
POLLY: No, no, I can't, Jamie, I can't. I can't. I can't. 
JAMIE: Polly! Polly! Come on. I'll help you.

[Tunnel]

(The water is still coming in.) 
DOCTOR: Zaroff. He's cut off. 
BEN: Zaroff? Who cares about him? That means the others must be, too. Well, are they? 
DOCTOR: Well, how do I know? All we can do is to go on going up. Come on. 
(In his lab, Zaroff is waist deep in water and still trying to reach the plunger. On a steep incline, Ben slips.) 
DOCTOR: Nearly there. Of course, if you will lie down and sleep. 
BEN: Who said anything about lying down?

[Cave]

(Just above the shoreline.) 
JAMIE: Come on. Come on. Fresh air. 
POLLY: Oh, we made it. Ben and the Doctor? 
JAMIE: I'm thinking he wouldn't have stood much of a chance back there. They may have. 
(Jamie leaves Polly to cry and goes off towards the beach. After a few moments she takes off her headdress and follows. In the lab, the rising water cuts out the power, but Zaroff keeps straining for the plunger even as it closes over his head.)

[Mountain cave]

DAMON: Any sign of the Doctor? 
ARA: No. He must have died saving us. 
THOUS: We'll raise a stone to him in the temple. 
DAMON: No. No more temples. It was temples and priests and superstition that made us follow Zaroff in the first place. When the water's found it's own level, the temple will be buried forever. We shall never return to it. But we will have enough left to build a new Atlantis, without gods and without fish people. 
THOUS: Yes. That shall be his memorial.

[Tunnel]

(Finally, daylight ahead.) 
BEN: Doctor, what about Polly?

[Mountainside]

(Jamie and Polly are sitting by a rock.) 
POLLY: I can't see anyone. 
(There is a noise behind them.) 
JAMIE: Whist. 
(Jamie draws his dirk and circles around.) 
DOCTOR: Boo! 
JAMIE: You! 
DOCTOR: Me? 
JAMIE: We thought you were dead. 
DOCTOR: Us? Polly, good to see you. Come on, you two. 
(They head down to the Tardis. Sean and Jacko arrive to see them go inside it.) 
SEAN: Oh, no. I can't believe it. 
JACKO: What? 
SEAN: A flaming English police box. 
(The Tardis dematerialises.)

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Right. Off we go into the wide blue yonder, as someone was once heard to remark. 
POLLY: Hooray. 
BEN: Yeah, I'm not sorry to be out of that place. Phwoar, Jamie, you don't half stink of fish! 
JAMIE: Oh, you want to take a wee sniff of yourself, Benjamin. He's not exactly a bonnie bunch of heather. 
DOCTOR: You sound very happy, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Oh aye, Doctor, I am now. You know I never thought I'd say this, but, well it's great. 
POLLY: What is? 
JAMIE: All this. I'll never know what makes it go, mind you, but, well, at least I feel safe in here. It's only the wee things outside that are, well, alarming. 
DOCTOR: He's got a point there. 
BEN: Yeah, you can say that again. 
JAMIE: Is it a fact, though, Doctor? You can't exactly control the Tardis? 
DOCTOR: Control it? Of course I can control it. 
JAMIE: No, no, what I meant was, can you not exactly make it go where you mean it to? 
DOCTOR: If I wanted to. It's just that I've never wanted to. 
(General sounds of disbelief.) 
BEN: Oh, yeah, I bet. 
DOCTOR: Right, just for that, I'll show you. Now, where shall we go? I know, let's go to Mars. 
(The Tardis suddenly lurches.) 
POLLY: Doctor, what's happening? 
BEN: Doctor, can't you do something? 
DOCTOR: Do something? I seem to have done something. It's all your fault, wanting me to tamper with the steering. I'm very sorry, everybody, but I'm afraid the Tardis is out of control! 
(Polly screams.)

[Tardis]

(The Tardis is going haywire.) 
JAMIE: What's he done? 
BEN: Doctor, do something! 
DOCTOR: I'm trying to! 
JAMIE: We're not going to make it. 
(Everyone is being thrown across the room and back as the Doctor fights the controls. Soon everything settles down.) 
DOCTOR: I have it back in control again. 
BEN: Here, we're landing. Look. Coming at a fair rate. 
JAMIE: Oh, thank the Lord for that. You know, Doctor, I'll never ask you to do that again. 
DOCTOR: Huh? Oh, no. There must have been a reason for that. 
POLLY: Anyway, Doctor, you've done it. It's Mars. It must be. You're landing the Tardis exactly where you said you would. 
(The Tardis materialises amongst magnificent desolation.) 
BEN: Hey, wait a mo! This don't look like Mars to me. 
POLLY: How would you know? You never seen it. 
BEN: No, Duchess, but I have seen pictures of the moon's surface and that's what this looks like. 
JAMIE: That's the moon? 
POLLY: Doctor, is it the moon? 
(The Doctor nods.) 
BEN: Oh, well, you weren't too far out, were you? Only about two hundred million miles. 
DOCTOR: All right, let's move on. While we can. 
POLLY: Now wait a minute! 
BEN: What? 
POLLY: You don't expect to land us on the moon and let us fly off just like that, do you? 
BEN: Yeah, at least let us have a look around! 
JAMIE: That picture canna be the moon. The moon's way up in the sky. 
DOCTOR: Where do you think you're going? 
BEN: You're not going to tell us there's no shore leave. 
POLLY: Ah, please, Doctor. The Tardis isn't out of control or anything is it? 
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. It was just a bumpy landing, that's all. 
BEN: Yeah? 
DOCTOR: Well, if you must go ashore, only half an hour. 
BEN: Right. 
POLLY: Super. 
DOCTOR: You can't go ashore like that! You need space suits. There's no atmosphere out there. Come on, there's some in the chest. 
(Jamie is still staring at the scanner.) 
JAMIE: We'll maybe meet the old man in the moon. 
BEN: You won't meet nobody mate if you don't get some gear on. 
JAMIE: What? Oh aye.

[Lunar surface]

(Some time later, all four of them are suited up and they leave the Tardis to look around.) 
DOCTOR: Come on now, let's go over here. 
POLLY: Hey, look at this. 
DOCTOR: It's deserted. 
JAMIE: I don't think I like it. 
(Polly sees a pulsating light.) 
POLLY: Look, over there. 
JAMIE: I'll don't see anything. 
BEN: What did you see? 
POLLY: Some sort of great glow in the sky. 
BEN: It's probably your eyes getting used to the lunar light, hey, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Possibly. 
POLLY: What do we need these great clogs for? 
DOCTOR: Try a little jump. 
POLLY: All right. 
(Polly takes a small jump and rises about ten feet, falling slowly and rolling gently as she lands. Ben and Jamie copy her and collide.) 
DOCTOR: Careful! One tear in that space suit and you'll suffocate. 
POLLY: You never told me you'd taken ballet lessons, Ben. 
(Polly takes a big jump to a the crater rim.) 
POLLY: Come on, it's easy. 
BEN: Look out, here I come. 
(Jamie jumps too far and goes over the rim and out of sight.) 
POLLY: Where's he gone? 
BEN: Over there. 
(From the rim of the crater they look down on a large domed building.) 
POLLY: What on Earth? Look! 
BEN: Blimey! What is it? 
POLLY: Doctor, what is it? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. 
POLLY: Hey, I can see Jamie. There he is. 
(Jamie is lying unconscious by the dome.) 
BEN: Hey, there's somebody coming out. 
DOCTOR: Come on, let's go. 
(Two spacesuited figures come out of the dome's airlock and take Jamie inside. The Doctor, Ben and Polly hurry to the dome and Ben knocks on the airlock. Then it slides open. After a brief pause, they all go in.)

[Control room]

(The moonbase is a weather control centre. A small team of scientists govern weather patterns on Earth using a powerful device called the Gravitron. A map of the Earth dominates one wall, and the Gravitron probe is in a transparent dome on one side of the room with it's power controls in an insulated room. Each person wears a numbered uniform, and the gravitron technicians wear protective headgear. They are monitoring a Pacific hurricane or typhoon when one of the workers collapses. An alarm sounds.) 
BENOIT: (2nd in command, French) What on Earth is it? 
(Played by Andre Maranne, possibly the only genuine French actor the BBC knew.) 
(A web of black lines covers the stricken man's face.) 
HOBSON: (base commander) I don't know. Get him along to the Medical unit. 
BENOIT: But Doctor Evans has gone down with it as well. 
HOBSON: Yes, I know that but the relief Doctor from Earth should be here on the next shuttle rocket. 
BENOIT: Yes, yes, of course. Bob, give me a hand, will you? 
BOB: Yes, right. 
(Benoit and Bob carry the man out.) 
HOBSON: And Jules, you take over. Come on, it won't bite you. There must be some source to this infection. Look, we'd better get the lads in here and tell them what's happening. Get them on the blower, would you, Nils? 
NILS: (the number 3, Danish) Okay, Hobby. (into intercom) Nils speaking. We, er, we've got a bit of a flap on up here. 
(Hobson is distracted by the arrival of the Doctor, Polly and Ben next door.)

[Reception room]

NILS [OC]: Mister Hobson wants a word with you all in weather control room. Quick as you can. 
HOBSON: Hello. Where did you lot spring from? Don't tell me the shuttle rocket's arrived already? 
DOCTOR: No, it hasn't. 
SAM: There was another one with them, sir. Bob's taken him along to the Medical unit. He's all right. He's just knocked himself out or something. 
HOBSON: Oh no, if we haven't got enough troubles already. Have they been through the sterile room? 
SAM: Yes, Hobby. 
DOCTOR: We don't want to cause you any trouble. Just let us collect our young friend and we'll be off. 
HOBSON: Hey, not so fast. 
POLLY: Please, let me go and see Jamie. 
BENOIT: I will take you there, mademoiselle, if you come with me. 
HOBSON: All right, young lady. You can carry on. 
BENOIT: This way. 
(Polly and Benoit leave.) 
HOBSON: But I'd just like to have a word with you two. You could do with a extra bacteria check by the look of it. 
DOCTOR: Bacteria check? 
HOBSON: That's what I said. 
BEN: Well, thanks. 
DOCTOR: I'll have you know our Tardis is as sterile as 
HOBSON: Tardis? 
DOCTOR: Our space craft. 
NILS: They're all here, sir. Any time you're ready. 
HOBSON: Right. Well, we'll learn about your spacecraft a little later. Meanwhile, you'd better come along with me, meet my team and listen to what I have to say. 
DOCTOR: Thank you very much.

[Control room]

HOBSON: Well, you know what this place is? 
DOCTOR: Well, it looks like some sort of weather control centre? Ah, yes. And that's the thing with which you control the weather. That's the culprit, then. 
BEN: Ay? 
DOCTOR: That's what gave us such a bumpy landing. Some sort of gravity device? 
HOBSON: Some sort of gravity device. You are from Earth, aren't you? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
HOBSON: Well, where've you been for the past 20 years. Every school kid knows about the Gravitron in there. 
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. It must be about the year 2050, Ben. 
HOBSON: We've got a proper Rip Van Winkle here. It's 2070, in case you'd like to know. 
DOCTOR: There you are. I was only twenty years out. 
HOBSON: Well, before we all forget what century we're in, I'd better tell you why I've called you here. 
DOCTOR: Won't you introduce us first? I am a Doctor. 
HOBSON: A Doctor? You're arrived just in time. We need your help. 
DOCTOR: Ah. Do you? 
HOBSON: I'll see you in a moment. Now, this virus 
DOCTOR: Well, I may be able to help you if you'll introduce us. 
HOBSON: Right, Doctor. You'd better meet them all. We're all scientists here, you see. No room for idle hands, I see to that. Roger Benoit, beside you there, is my assistant. He takes over as Chief Scientist if anything happens to me. He's a physicist like me and Joe Benson there. Nils, our mad Dane, is an astronomer and mathematician as is Charlie here. Ralph, Jules and Franz are geologists. When they're not acting as cooks, looks-outs, general and, you know, handymen. 
DOCTOR: And this is where you control the Earth's weather? I see. 
BENOIT: The gravitron there controls the tides, the tides controls the weather. And from this console here we plot it all on that map. Simple, eh? 
BEN: Oh, yeah, very simple. Wish we'd had all this back in 1966. 
DOCTOR: Was it a bad year then? 
(An alarm sounds.) 
BEN: What's that? What's happened? 
(A man has collapsed inside the gravitron chamber.) 
HOBSON: It's Jim. Quick, Franz, take over here. 
(Franz puts on a helmet and goes into the chamber. Ralph and John carry Jim to the medical unit.) 
BENOIT: Indicator Five over the Pacific is starting to move. 
BEN: What does that mean? 
DOCTOR: Some form of change in the weather. 
HOBSON: We're soon hear from Earth what it means. 
NILS: Here it comes! 
CONTROL [OC]: International Space Control Headquarters Earth calling Weather Control Moon. Come in please. 
NILS: Moonport standing by. 
CONTROL [OC]: Earth calling Weather Control Moon. Come in please. 
NILS: Moonport standing by. 
HOBSON: Hobson here. 
CONTROL [OC]: What's happening up there? The hurricane you were guiding is now 45 degrees off course. It's threatening Hawaii. 
HOBSON: One of my men was taken ill. We're operational again now. 
CONTROL [OC]: The controller would like to know the cause of the illness. 
HOBSON: Yes, so would we. We've now got three men down with this mystery virus in the past few hours, including the doctor. 
CONTROL [OC]: One moment please. Stand by for further instructions. 
HOBSON: Just hang on another couple of minutes, lads. We'd better hear what the great Mister Rinberg has to say. 
NILS: Hobby? 
HOBSON: Yes. 
NILS: There it is again. I'll play it back to you. 
HOBSON [OC]: Yes, so would we. We've now got three men down with this mystery virus in the past few hours, including the Doctor. 
CONTROL [OC]: One moment please. Stand by for further instructions. 
NILS: Hear the big noise ratio on that re-run? We're being monitored again. 
HOBSON: Monitored? 
NILS: Someone, not too far away from the base, is listening to every word we say. 
CONTROL [OC]: Moonbase, Moonbase. Come in, Moonbase. 
HOBSON: Still standing by.

[Spacecraft]

(An alien spacecraft is concealed a short way from the dome, monitoring the conversation.) 
HOBSON [OC]: Well? 
CONTROL [OC]: Your instructions are to send blood samples back to Earth for investigation. 
HOBSON [OC]: Well, when can we do that? The next shuttle rocket's not for another month. 
CONTROL [OC]: Then they must be put on that rocket. In the meantime the Moonbase is to be put in quarantine.

[Control room]

HOBSON: Quarantine? What if these men aren't fit enough to get back to work. I shall need replacements. 
CONTROL [OC]: If you radio information about this virus, we'll do our best to identify it and suggest treatment. 
HOBSON: I demand to speak to Rinberg.

[Space ship]

CONTROL [OC]: The controller is busy. I'm sorry. Over and out.

[Control room]

NILS: That whole conversion was monitored by someone or something. 
HOBSON: Oh, never mind about that now. That Rinberg fellow just won't talk to you. How can we trace down this mystery illness with the doctor himself down with it. 
DOCTOR: We'd better get out of these things and see how Jamie is. Perhaps I could be of help in the sick bay now. 
HOBSON: Anything you can do. Bob! 
BOB: Yes, Mister Hobson? 
HOBSON: Show him to the Medical unit, will you? 
BOB: Yes, of course, sir. Will you come this way, please. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Thank you. 
(Bob, Ben and the Doctor leave.) 
HOBSON: Well, you all heard the position. We don't know what this infection is or how it got into the base, but I want you all to take extra precautions while this emergency is on. We may be short-handed for quite a while.

[Sickbay]

(Polly is attaching a medical monitor to Jamie's chest.) 
POLLY: Is this how it goes, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. Then this unit automatically controls the pulse, the temperature and the breathing. 
POLLY: A sort of electronic doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Almost got striped trousers. 
BEN: And it even gives him medicines too? 
DOCTOR: Yes, it will do very nearly everything. 
POLLY: It can't be nice to him. Oh dear. How do you think he is, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Oh, he's not too bad. He's a bit concussed and feverish, but he'll be all right with rest. 
JAMIE: The Piper. The McCrimmon Piper. Don't let him get me! 
DOCTOR: Piper? 
POLLY: Some legend of his clan. As far as I can make out, this piper appears to a McCrimmon just before he dies. 
DOCTOR: Has this phantom piper appeared to Jamie yet? 
POLLY: You don't believe it, do you? 
DOCTOR: No, but he does. It's important to him. 
POLLY: He keeps asking us to keep the piper away from him. 
DOCTOR: Good. Well, we'll see whether we can do just that. 
BEN: Well, carry on, nurse. 
POLLY: Well, at least I tried to help. With a ward full of sick men and no doctor, somebody's got to do something. 
(A patient is groaning.) 
POLLY: I wonder who this is? 
DOCTOR: Don't get too near, Polly. Have a look on his chart. 
POLLY: Yes, that's a good idea. 
BEN: It's Doctor Evans. 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. The station doctor. He was the first one to get it. 
POLLY: He looks one of the worst. 
DOCTOR: There's something about this epidemic that I don't quite understand. It's not like a real disease at all. It's almost as if 
BEN: Not real? What more do you want? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. But there are certain signs and symptoms which don't add up. Ben, I want you to go along to the control room and keep an eye on things. 
BEN: Well, how? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. Give a hand, do anything, but keep your eyes and ears open. 
BEN: Right. 
DOCTOR: There's something very wrong here. Very wrong indeed.

[Control room]

(The base is on it's night cycle. Benoit returns from a break.) 
BENOIT: Still up, Hobby? Why not take a rest. Go and get some sleep. 
HOBSON: How can I rest with that thing up the spout. You know the score as well as I do. Five units off centre we lift half London into space. Five more and the Atlantic water level goes up three feet. Rinberg just doesn't understand the pressure we're under. Hey, you! What do you thinking you're doing skulking there? 
BEN: Well, I was just wondering if I can help, sir. 
HOBSON: Help? How could you help? 
BENOIT: We could do with an extra pair of hands. He can help me. 
HOBSON: Well, keep him away from me, that's all. All right, I'll go and lie down. Call me if anything happens. 
BENOIT: Yes, of course. 
HOBSON: Oh, by the way. There were two more of those momentary drops in air pressure while I was on. I've put them in the log. 
BENOIT: Right. 
(Hobson leaves.) 
BENOIT: Well, there are some coffee cups to clear away if you wish to be helpful. And er, oh er, Ralph, that is, no. 14, needs a hand down in the food store. Can you find your way there? 
BEN: Yeah, I'll find it. 
BENOIT: Good boy.

[Food store]

(Ralph is loading a trolley with supplies from the shelves and ticking them off a list. He picks up a sack of sugar and the contents spill onto the floor through a hole in the bottom. He throws it into the waste disposal.) 
RALPH: (american) Anyone would think we've got rats up here. 
(A tin falls.) 
RALPH: Who's that? Who is it? 
BEN: It's only me, mate. 
RALPH: Oh, for heaven's sake. Don't go sneaking around like that. 
BEN: Blimey, you lot aren't half edgy. 
RALPH: You will be too, mate, if you've been up here long enough. Say, are you responsible for the broken bags here. 
BEN: Come off it. I've only just arrived, haven't I? 
RALPH: Okay. See and you can find that light. Round the back there, most likely. 
BEN: Okay. 
RALPH: Let's see. We still need some more milk and sugar. 
(As Ralph searches the shelves a huge figure looms out of the darkness. There's an electric shock sound. Ralph's body is dragged away before Ben returns.) 
BEN: Number 14? Ralph? Where are you? Scarpered. Funny bloke.

[Sickbay]

(Polly is dozing.) 
POLLY: What's that? 
DOCTOR: Shh. It's all right, Polly, it's only me. We don't want to wake everybody up, do we? You look as though you could do with some sleep yourself. 
POLLY: I'm all right. What have you got there? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I've been doing a little investigation. 
POLLY: A piece of silver paper. What is it? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. 
(The lights dim.) 
POLLY: What's happened? 
DOCTOR: Oh, it's nothing. It probably just a changeover in the time cycle. 
POLLY: What do you mean? 
DOCTOR: Oh well, you see, it's rather interesting really. You see, on the moon they have a fortnight of days and a fortnight of nights. 
POLLY: Well? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's obvious, isn't it? They have to make their own day and night artificially up here, or it would upset their whole biological time clock. 
POLLY: Their what? 
DOCTOR: They won't know whether they were coming or going. Get it? 
POLLY: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Clever girl. QED. That's why it's dark up here. 
POLLY: Oh, I see what you mean. Yes, of course. How stupid of me. 
DOCTOR: Of course along at the control centre it's probably broad daylight. Polly, you wouldn't be making fun of me, would you? 
POLLY: No. 
(A man screams.) 
POLLY: Doctor Evans! 
(Evans is sweating heavily, and delirious.) 
EVANS: The hand. No, don't touch me. No. The silver hand. (scream) 
POLLY: Doctor, is he? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid he is. 
POLLY: What are we going to do? 
DOCTOR: What did he mean by the silver hand? I'd better report this to Mister Hobson.

[Control room]

(Ben is reporting Ralph's disappearance.) 
HOBSON: Can't find him? Ralph? 
BEN: Well, I was helping him load some stores and he just disappeared. 
HOBSON: What, in this place? Well, there are only nineteen of us. 
DOCTOR: Have you tried his quarters? 
BEN: Yeah. 
HOBSON: Why didn't you report this to me? 
BEN: Well, I'm just telling you now, aren't I? 
HOBSON: Now what is the matter? 
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry. It's Doctor Evans. 
HOBSON: Well? 
DOCTOR: I'm afraid he's dead. 
HOBSON: Dead? No. 
BENOIT: This must be reported at once. 
HOBSON: Yes, yes. No! No, we haven't got enough data yet. You know what they're like down there. I'll come to the sick bay with you. Come on.

[Sickbay]

(Polly is helping Jamie drink a glass of water.) 
POLLY: Here. Gently, Jamie. 
(Jamie's eyes widen in panic as he sees something behind Polly.) 
POLLY: Jamie! 
(Jamie tries to speak, then passes out again. Polly turns and screams. The Doctor, Hobson and others run in.) 
HOBSON: What the matter? 
POLLY: Something just went out of that door! 
HOBSON: Nils! John! 
DOCTOR: What was it? 
NILS: Nothing. Nothing there. 
HOBSON: Your nerves are getting the better of you. Where's Evans' body? 
POLLY: Over there. 
HOBSON: All right, let's get it over. 
(Nils lifts the blanket but the bed is empty.) 
HOBSON: Is this someone's idea of a particularly bad joke? 
DOCTOR: This is no joke, believe me! 
BENOIT: Mister Hobson, Mister Hobson, you are wanted! Another man's collapsed at the controls. The Gravitron has gone off alignment again. 
HOBSON: Come on! And you'd better find that doctor's body or out you all go, quarantine or no quarantine. 
(Hobson, Benoit and co all leave.) 
POLLY: I don't understand what could have happened. I must have dozed off or something. One thing I am sure of. Something went out of that door just as you came in. 
DOCTOR: That body can't just have vanished. Polly, I'm going to leave you alone, now just for a minute. 
POLLY: All right. 
JAMIE: Water. Water. 
POLLY: I'll go and get you some. 
JAMIE: Water. 
(Polly leaves. The other door slides open and a tall figure moves across the room to Jamie's bed. Jamie looks at it.)
JAMIE: It's you. The phantom piper!

Episode Two

[Sickbay]

(Jamie suddenly sits up and stares at the tall silver figure in front of him. It has a blank metal face with round eye holes and a slit for the mouth. Tubes come from where its ears should be and connect at a round device on the top of it's head. We seen something like this before, but Jamie hasn't.) 
JAMIE: No! No, I'll not go with you. Do you hear me, piper? No, leave me. Leave me, I'll not go with you, do you hear me? Leave me. No, I'll not go with you. 
(The cyberman goes round the other beds.) 
JAMIE: I'll fight you every inch of the way. I'll not go with ya. No. No. 
(The cyberman takes the blanket off another patient and carries off the struggling man.) 
JAMIE: Leave me, piper. No, leave me, I'll not go. 
(Polly returns with the water for Jamie. She screams. Hobson, the Doctor, Ben and two other men run in.) 
DOCTOR: Polly! Polly, what's happened? 
POLLY: Oh, Doctor! Doctor, it was horrible. A great creature like a, like a Cyberman. 
DOCTOR: It's all right. Don't be frightened. Whatever it was, it's all gone now. 
POLLY: Yes, but Doctor, the Cyberman was carrying one of the patients out! 
DOCTOR: Cyberman? 
HOBSON: Cyberman? What are you talking about? 
POLLY: I'm sure it was. I'm sure it was! 
DOCTOR: Are you sure? 
JAMIE: I'll not go with you! 
BEN: All right, mate. You're safe now. Take it easy. 
POLLY: Yes it did, I promise you. 
HOBSON: She's right. There's another one gone. Sam, Jules, you've got to find these men. They can't just disappear in a place this size. Search every square inch, don't come back until you've found them. Now move. 
(Sam and Jules leave.) 
HOBSON: Now, supposing you tell me your story. What did you see? 
POLLY: Well, I went out to get Jamie some water and when I came back I saw this giant man or creature or something just going out of the door carrying one of the patients like a doll. I think it was a Cyberman. 
HOBSON: Forget the Cyberman part. Then what? 
POLLY: Well, then nothing. The door shut and then you came in. 
HOBSON: What do you know about all this? 
DOCTOR: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
HOBSON: We'll see about that in a minute. This thing you saw, what was it like? 
POLLY: It was enormous and silver, and it had holes in it's head for eyes, like a robot! 
HOBSON: A robot? 
BEN: But the Cybermen were all killed when Mondas blew up, weren't they? 
HOBSON: Stop this Cyberman nonsense. There were Cybermen, every child knows that, but they were all destroyed ages ago. 
DOCTOR: So we all thought. 
HOBSON: That's enough. Now let's have a little calm thinking. For the past two weeks a completely unknown disease has appeared in the base. People drop in their tracks, they develop this black pattern on their skin. Then some of the patients disappear, right? Well, they can't leave the base without wearing space suits, and there are no space suits missing, so where are they? 
DOCTOR: I must say it does sound a little odd. 
HOBSON: More than a little. Well I do know one thing. A new disease starts, people disappear and then you turn up. 
POLLY: And you think we did it. 
BEN: Oh, come off it, we haven't done a thing. 
HOBSON: That's as maybe. I don't know who you are, what you are or where you come from. But you can get off the moon now. 
BEN: Yeah, well that suits me fine. The sooner the better. 
DOCTOR: No, Ben. We can't go yet. 
BEN: Well, why not? They don't want us here. 
DOCTOR: Because there is something evil here and we must stay. 
HOBSON: Evil? Don't be daft. 
DOCTOR: Evil is what I meant. There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything that we believe in. They must be fought. This disease, for instance. It isn't really a disease at all, but I can help you with it. You'll see. I'll find the cause for you. 
HOBSON: Will you, indeed? 
DOCTOR: Yes, certainly. I just need to examine a few things, that's all. It should be simple. 
HOBSON: Well, I'm not sure. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you just one Earth day cycle to find the cause. 
BEN: Earth what? 
HOBSON: Twenty four hours. 
BEN: But that's no time at all. 
HOBSON: It's all the time you're going to get. Then you get off the moon, complete with this bloke here. 
POLLY: But you can't move him. He's very ill. 
DOCTOR: We accept. Now tell me, you have pathological equipment here, yes? 
HOBSON: Yes, Evans was working on an extensive research project. It's all in here. 
(They go to an area marked off by a ring of workbenches and shelves.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'll have a look in here. 
HOBSON: It's quite a small unit. We're not equipped to deal with a full scale epidemic, you understand. Do you think you can manage? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I can. 
HOBSON: Right. Well, I'll leave you to it. But don't forget, twenty four hours. 
(Hobson leaves. The Doctor takes a tray of items over to a patient.) 
BEN: What are you going to do, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: We're going to start with this one. 
POLLY: Listen, are you really a medical doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I was once, Polly. I think I took a degree once in Glasgow. 1888 I think. Lister. Hold that for me, will you? 
(The Doctor swabs a black-lined hand, and the arm convulses.) 
DOCTOR: It's all right. He's quite unconscious. 
BEN: Well look, what can we do to help? 
DOCTOR: I shall need to examine everything. Clothes, boots, food, towels, soap, everything. Will you get them for me, please? 
POLLY: Have you any idea what it might be? 
DOCTOR: No. Not an idea. But we'll find it out.

[Control room]

HOBSON: I don't understand it. I'm sure there's a lack of co-ordination somewhere. 
BENOIT: Yes, but where? 
HOBSON: On the indicators, look. It should be steady as a rock. 
BENOIT: The fault must be in the gravitron. 
HOBSON: Nils, here. 
NILS: Yes Hobby? 
HOBSON: I'm going to run a test. Move the probe and we'll see if the indicators move the right distance on the map. Okay? 
NILS: Right. 
HOBSON: Benoit, keep an eye on the probe itself, will you? 
BENOIT: Okay. All yours, Bob. 
BOB: Right. 
(Benoit walks over to watch the gravitron probe.) 
HOBSON: Deflect probe five degrees, now. Way off. Five degrees should put them over Iceland. Move the probe back again. 
NILS: Right. 
BENOIT: The probe seems to deflect all right. 
HOBSON: The fault must be here. This could be a major disaster if we can't stabilise the Earth's field. 
NILS: If we lose that hurricane, Mister Hobson, all hell will break loose on the Earth. I've a wife and family. 
HOBSON: Yeah, you're not the only one. Roger, check the potentiometers. 
BENOIT: Right. 
(Benoit puts on a helmet and enters the control area.) 
HOBSON: Nils, check the gravitation units. Shake it up. We haven't got much time. 
NILS: Field stabilising at 48, Mister Hobson. 
HOBSON: Prepare to move probe. Check co-ordinates. We've got to hold that hurricane in the Pacific. Stand by. Now. 
(Benoit returns.) 
BENOIT: Twenty degree tilt complete. 
HOBSON: The field's not correcting. We'll have to increase the reactor power. 
BENOIT: You can't do that. The torus will burn out. 
HOBSON: It's all we can do. 
(The communication centre comes into life.) 
CONTROL [OC]: International Space Control. 
R/T: Earth calling. 
CONTROL [OC]: Earth calling Moon Weather Control. Stand by. Stand by for the controller. 
R/T: This is Moonbase. Come in please. 
CONTROL [OC]: We wish to speak to Mister Hobson. 
HOBSON: Hobson speaking. 
CONTROL [OC]: Stand by for the Controller. 
HOBSON: Right. He's actually going to speak to us this time. 
RINBERG [OC]: Controller Rinberg speaking. Is that you, Hobson? 
HOBSON: Yes, Rinberg. 
RINBERG [OC]: The directional fields are showing a progressive error. Reports have come in of wide-spread pressure fluctuations in Atlantic zone 6. You must get the gravitron back into balance. 
HOBSON: We're trying to compensate by re-aligning the probe. We have an error in the servos. 
RINBERG [OC]: Well, there's no sign of any improvement here. We've just had a report from Miami, Florida. Thirty minutes ago they were enjoying clear skies and a heat wave. Now Hurricane Lucy is right overhead. 
BENOIT: There is only one thing to do. 
HOBSON: What's that? 
BENOIT: Shut it down. 
HOBSON: What, switch the gravitron off?! 
BENOIT: Yes, it's the only chance. 
HOBSON: We can't do that, man. The collapse of the gravity would devastate half the globe. There'd be storms, whirlwinds, hurricanes. 
RINBERG [OC]: I overheard your conversation. It's quite out of the question. You're not to shut down the gravitron under any circumstances, and that's an order. I think perhaps you don't appreciate how serious the situation already is. 
HOBSON: I bet he gets a knighthood. 
RINBERG [OC]: We spent years in a general assembly negotiating methods of agreement between farmers and landowners and so on. Now the weather's out of control they're after our blood, and I must say I can't blame them. You've got to get that thing under control, quickly. Now please get on with it. 
CONTROL [OC]: Earth control, over and out. 
HOBSON: Well, you're all in the picture. We've got trouble, bad trouble, we haven't got much time. We're going to run through every circuit, every field pattern, every damn nut and bolt on Charlie boy in there until he's running sweet and smooth. A full class A test, in fact. Now you all know what to do so let's get on with it. 
MEN: Okay, Chief. 
HOBSON: Right, we'll start on the main tape programme. 
BENOIT: Right.

[Computer room]

(A proper computer bank, with turning magnetic tapes and stuff.) 
NILS: It's running now. 
HOBSON: Right, give me the analogue value on module 6, will you? 
BENOIT: Will do. They look all right. A at 10 millivolts. B at 15 millivolts, C at 26. That fits, doesn't it? 
HOBSON: Yes, they're at normal levels. Roger, finish checking here, will you? The answer may be in the control panel. 
BENOIT: Okay. I'll sing out the binary conversion values, you check them on read out, okay? 
NILS: Right. 
BENOIT: Right. 
(The Doctor has stuck in and is taking samples of fibres from Benoit's shirt.) 
BENOIT: Channel one. 
NILS: Jah. 
BENOIT: Eight. 
NILS: Right. 
BENOIT: One. 
NILS: Mm-hm. 
BENOIT: Three. 
NILS: Jah. 
BENOIT: Four. 
(The Doctor starts plucking at Benoit's trouser leg.) 
NILS: Jah. 
BENOIT: Six. 
NILS: Right. 
BENOIT: Eight. 
NILS: Right. 
BENOIT: Twelve. 
NILS: Jah. 
BENOIT: Right? 
NILS: Right. All spot on. 
BENOIT: Right. 
(Benoit notices the Doctor and turns on him.) 
BENOIT: Eh là, qu'est-ce que vous fabriquez ici, imbécile d'idiot! Vous n'avez rien d'autre à faire? Vous croyez que nous sommes en train de nous amuser? Oh, come on. Get out of the way. 
DOCTOR: Enchanté, monsieur.

[Control room]

BENOIT: Now, where were we? Ah, yes, the fluid servo pressures. I reckon this is probably where the fault is. 
NILS: Er, do you want them all or just the main tank readings? 
BENOIT: The main will do. 
NILS: Right. Header one, 45 pounds. 
BENOIT: Yes. 
NILS: Header two, 47 
BENOIT: Yes. 
NILS: Three, 42. 
(The Doctor starts unfastening Nils' bootlaces.) 
BENOIT: Yes. 
NILS: Sine values equivalent. 
BENOIT: They all fit. Nothing there. 
NILS: It must be the potentiometer net, then. 
BENOIT: Looks like it. Take us some time to do that. We'll need the digital voltmeter. 
NILS: Right, I'll get it. 
(Nils steps out of his boot.) 
HOBSON: What the blazes are you doing? 
DOCTOR: I'm just collecting specimens. 
HOBSON: Specimens? Oh, yes. Well, get on with it.

[Sickbay]

BEN: We're nearly out of this interferon stuff. 
POLLY: Oh. Well you'd better go and ask Mister Hobson where the rest is. 
BEN: Yeah, right. 
(Ben leaves. Jamie groans.) 
POLLY: Shh. It's all right, Jamie, it's all right. You're going to get better but you must lie still. 
JAMIE: Oh, what is this place? Is it the home of the piper? 
POLLY: No, we're on the moon. You know, the moon, up in the sky. 
JAMIE: Oh no, I can't be alive. I've just seen the piper. 
(Jamie sits up. The cyberman is standing there. Polly tries to get away but it fires an electric sounding charge at her head and she collapses.) 
JAMIE: The piper! I knew! 
(The cyberman shocks Jamie unconscious then carries off the man in the next bed. The Doctor enters with his tray of samples.) 
DOCTOR: Polly! What's happened? Polly. Are you all right?

[Control room]

(The place is a hive of activity.) 
HOBSON: Anything out on the probe's servos? 
BENOIT: The error detectors show a slight discrepancy, in normal limits, though. 
HOBSON: What about the overall feedback valve? We haven't checked that. 
BENOIT: No, that's an idea. 
HOBSON: You know, I don't think it's likely to be a mechanical fault. 
JOE: Mister Hobson, an air pressure drop again. 
HOBSON: Same as before? 
JOE: Yes, just the same. Lasts about five seconds. 
HOBSON: Something's odd. It's not the pumps, I'm sure of that. Has anyone asked permission to leave the base? 
JOE: No. As far as I know, the compression chamber's empty. 
HOBSON: If I find anybody's been fooling about in there without permission, I'll tear their hides off.

[Store room]

(Bags fall down from a pile against the wall as a cyberman pushes his way in through a hole before rebuilding the stack to hide it again.)

[Control room]

JOE: The pressure's up again now, sir. 
HOBSON: Thank heaven for that. I'm going to check over the control loop monitor. 
BENOIT: Control loop monitor? Huh. I think you're wasting your time. 
HOBSON: Nothing's a waste of time till we trace this fault, and don't you forget it! You saw what's happening on Earth. We can't afford to miss anything. Now get on with it! 
SAM: I think I've found something! 
HOBSON: What is it? 
SAM: One of the probe control antennae. 
BENOIT: Well, what's the matter with it? 
SAM: Well, according to these readings there are at least two pieces of it missing. It's just not coordinating. 
HOBSON: Missing? 
BENOIT: Meteorites? 
HOBSON: Could be. There could be a simpler explanation. Roger, when did these people arrive here? 
BENOIT: The end of period 11 in this present lunar day. 
HOBSON: And when did the gravitron start playing up? 
BENOIT: About the beginning of period 12. 
HOBSON: Sam, when was the last time we had anyone outside? 
SAM: During period 13. Two men went outside to realign one of the solar mirrors. 
HOBSON: That's it. 
BENOIT: I'm not quite with you. 
HOBSON: Well, it's simple. Strangers arrive period 11, the gravitron goes up the spout period 12. 
BENOIT: I understand. But it can't 
HOBSON: Come on. It's time we put that Doctor and his friend in cold storage. Just a second. Get two men outside to look at the antennae, will you, Sam? 
SAM: Okay. Right, Joe, nip along to the mess deck, tell Jules and Franz I want them here pretty sharpish. 
JOE: Right. 
(Ben enters.) 
HOBSON: Well, now what is it? 
BEN: Another patient's gone, sir. 
HOBSON: What? Come on!

[Airlock]

(Jules and Franz enter, wearing space suits. They check each other's equipment then open the doors. They climb ladders, open two more doors and step out.)

[Sickbay]

(The Doctor is examining slides on a microscope.) 
DOCTOR: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
POLLY: Isn't there any clue at all? 
DOCTOR: No. It's a complete blank. All the tests are negative. As far as I can see this whole ridiculous place is completely sterile. 
POLLY: We'll have to go and tell Mister Hobson, I suppose. 
DOCTOR: He's not going to like it very much. I simply don't understand it. 
POLLY: Doctor, it wouldn't, I mean it couldn't possibly have anything to do with Lister, could it? 
DOCTOR: Lister? 
POLLY: Well, I mean, you did say that you took your degree in Glasgow in 1888. It does seem an awful long time from now, 2070 or whatever it is. 
DOCTOR: Polly, are you suggesting that I'm not competent to carry out these tests? 
POLLY: Oh, no. No, no, no, no. I was just wondering if there was anything that Joseph Lister didn't know in 1888 that might possibly help you now. 
DOCTOR: Shh! Somebody's coming. It's Mister Hobson, out for blood. Ours. Look busy. Quick! 
(Hobson and Ben enter.) 
HOBSON: That's as might be, but that's the third person to disappear in the past few hours. It's completely illogical. Single beds, no way to get out. 
DOCTOR: Do you mind?! 
HOBSON: What? 
DOCTOR: Would you mind standing away from the door and allowing it to close? The slides, the dust. 
HOBSON: Okay. It must be you people. We've got some straight talking to do, you and I. 
DOCTOR: Polly. 
POLLY: Yes? 
DOCTOR: Another boot. 
POLLY: Right. 
HOBSON: Do you hear me? 
DOCTOR: This is extraordinary. 
POLLY: Excuse me, please. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
HOBSON: Now look here. 
DOCTOR: Excuse me, please. We are trying to help you, you know. 
HOBSON: Help? Is that what you call it? You can all get off the moon now. 
POLLY: Now, wait a minute, you said 
HOBSON: I don't care what I said. 
DOCTOR: Ah! 
HOBSON: Found something? 
DOCTOR: I think perhaps I have. 
HOBSON: Really? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I may be onto something, but I must have some room. How can I work under these conditions? Now out, please! Come along, outside. I'm trying to work in here! Ben, see that they stay outside. 
(The Moonbase personnel are hustled out.) 
POLLY: Doctor, did you mean that? 
DOCTOR: What? 
POLLY: You've found something. 
DOCTOR: Oh, Polly, I only wish I had. Why not make some coffee to keep them all happy while I think of something? 
POLLY: All right.

[Lunar surface]

(Jules and Franz start checking the antennae when two shadows loom over them. The cybermen club them to ground, knocking them out.)

[Outside Sickbay]

(The Doctor comes out of sickbay.) 
HOBSON: Here, Doctor. You've completed your examination? 
DOCTOR: Yes, just about. 
HOBSON: Turned the base upside down, poked into everything? 
DOCTOR: Yes, clothes, boots, food. 
HOBSON: And you've found? 
DOCTOR: Absolutely nothing. 
HOBSON: Just as I thought. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. 
HOBSON: So what I told you still stands. 
(Polly brings a tray.) 
DOCTOR: Ah, coffee. Splendid. Thank you, Polly. I think we could all do with a cup. 
HOBSON: Benoit, you'd better go outside and see how Jules and Franz are getting on. 
BENOIT: Right.

[Lunar surface]

(There are two empty space suits lying by the antennae.)

[Outside Sickbay]

POLLY: Coffee? 
HOBSON: Well, Doctor.
POLLY: Sugar? 
HOBSON: Oh, thank you. 
POLLY: It's very hot. Doctor, what about you? 
DOCTOR: Thank you, Polly. 
HOBSON: Well, Doctor, as I was saying, you've had your chance and you've come up with absolutely nothing. Now I want 
(Number 15 has just taken a mouthful of coffee when he groans and collapses.) 
DOCTOR: Don't touch him! Let me look. 
(Black lines spread quickly across the man's skin.) 
HOBSON: Here, Charlie and you, what's your name, Ben, give us a hand to get him into the medical unit. 
DOCTOR: Try not to touch his skin. 
(The stricken man is carried away.) 
DOCTOR: Don't drink that! 
HOBSON: What the hell? 
DOCTOR: It's the sugar! Don't you see? That's why the disease doesn't affect everyone. It's the sugar. Not everyone takes it. No, don't touch it. 
(The Doctor uses forceps to pick up the sugar dispenser.)

[Sickbay]

(The Doctor pours some sugar onto a microscope slide.) 
HOBSON: What are you doing? 
DOCTOR: Just be patient. Just as I thought. A large neurotropic virus. 
HOBSON: What, like the space plague? 
DOCTOR: No. It's a large, infective agent that only attacks the nerves. That's why the patients have got these lines on their faces and their hands. It follows the course of the nerves under the skin. 
HOBSON: That's all very well, but how did it get in here? 
DOCTOR: Oh, it is the Cybermen. I believe they have deliberately infected the base. 
HOBSON: My men have searched every square inch of the base. There's no space to hide a cat, let alone a Cyberman! Anyhow, how did they get in? 
DOCTOR: One moment. 
HOBSON: What is it? 
DOCTOR: You say you searched all the base? 
HOBSON: Yes. What of it? 
DOCTOR: Every nook and cranny? 
HOBSON: Yes. 
DOCTOR: No chance of anyone hiding anywhere? 
HOBSON: None whatever. 
DOCTOR: Did your men search in here? 
HOBSON: Well 
DOCTOR: Did they? 
HOBSON: Well, there were always people in here, so they probably 
DOCTOR: Did they search in here? 
HOBSON: No! 
POLLY: But there's nowhere in here they could hide. 
(The Doctor round sickbay until they come to a bed where a body is covered by a blanket, but large silver boots are sticking out.) 
POLLY: Oh, no. No, no, no. 
DOCTOR: (sotto) Back. 
(The cyberman throws back the blanket and leaps out of the bed, weapon ready. )

Episode Three

[Sickbay]  

CYBERMAN 1: Stand back. Stand back from that door. 
(It is a much more mechanical voice than the last time we met them.) 
HOBSON: You're right. It is them. 
(Bob rushes to the cyberman with a metal bar.) 
HOBSON: Quick! Get out of here! 
(A second cyberman appears and fires his weapon.) 
DOCTOR: No! 
(Bob falls, smoke coming from his body.) 
CYBERMAN 1: Remain still. 
HOBSON: You devils. You killed him! An unarmed man. 
CYBERMAN 1: Get up. See that they remain there. 
CYBERMAN 2: Yes. 
(Cyberman 1 uses the transmitter on his chest to contact their ship.) 
CYBERMAN 1: Operational system two now complete. Operational system two now complete.

[Space ship]

CYBERMAN 1 [OC]: Ready to start Operational system three 
CYBERMAN 3: Understood. Operational system three will now begin.

[Sickbay]

CYBERMAN 1: You are known to us. 
DOCTOR: And you to me. 
CYBERMAN 1: Silence. Who is in command? 
HOBSON: I am. 
CYBERMAN 1: You will be needed. 
HOBSON: What have you done with my men? 
CYBERMAN 1: They will return. 
HOBSON: They're not dead? 
CYBERMAN 1: No. They are not dead. They are altered. 
BEN: Altered? What have you done to them? 
CYBERMAN 1: They are now controlled. 
HOBSON: If you do anything to my 
CYBERMAN 1: You will do nothing. 
(The second cyberman examines the patients and then gets to Jamie.) 
CYBERMAN 2: This one has not received neurotrope X. Stand back. 
POLLY: Please, leave him alone. His head is hurt. He's had an accident. 
CYBERMAN 2: His head? Then he would be of no value. The others are ready for conversion. 
CYBERMAN 1: You will now take us to the control centre. 
HOBSON: I'll be damned if 
(The cyberman points his weapon at Hobson.) 
HOBSON: It's through here. 
(Hobson, the cyberman and the Doctor leave.) 
CYBERMAN 2: You will remain here. If you leave you will be converted like the others. 
(That cyberman leaves.) 
BEN: I don't like that word converted.

[Space ship]

(Doctor Evans, Franz and Ralph are being converted. They are all fitted with a metal headpiece.) 
CYBERMAN 3: Raise your left arm. 
(The three men lift their left arms.) 
CYBERMAN 3: Raise your right arm. 
CYBERMAN 4: Control is excellent. Transfer that one to the capsule. 
(Two cybermen wheel in a man-sized canister. Evans is locked inside it.)

[Control room]

BENOIT: It's about time that we heard from those two outside. Let's have a word with them. 
NILS: All yours, Roger. 
BENOIT: Surface party, come in please. Surface party, come in please. Surface party, come in. We are not receiving you. Over. Can we see the control antenna from here? 
NILS: No, Roger. It's just around that first block outside the main port. 
BENOIT: Well, we'll have to send someone else out so get ready to 
(Hobson enters.) 
HOBSON: Get back! Get back! These things are lethal. 
CYBERMAN 1: No one will move. You will remain still. If you move you will be killed. 
BENOIT: What are they? How did they get in? 
CYBERMAN 1: Silence. We are Cybermen. You will listen. 
BENOIT: But you were all killed! 
CYBERMAN 1: We are going to take over the Gravitron and use it to destroy the surface of the Earth by changing the weather. 
DOCTOR: But that will kill everybody on the Earth. 
CYBERMAN 1: Yes. 
HOBSON: You're supposed to be so advanced. Here you are taking your revenge like, like children. 
CYBERMAN 1: Revenge? What is that? 
HOBSON: A feeling people have when 
CYBERMAN 1: Feelings? Feelings? Yes, we know of this weakness of yours. We are fortunate. We do not posses feelings. 
BENOIT: Then why are you here? 
CYBERMAN 1: To eliminate all dangers. 
HOBSON: But you'll kill every living thing on the Earth. 
CYBERMAN 1: Yes. All dangers will be eliminated. 
BENOIT: Have you no mercy? 
CYBERMAN 1: It is unnecessary. Keep watch on them. 
(Cyberman 1 moves away to activate his communicator.) 
HOBSON: Don't rush him, Nils. 
CYBERMAN 1: Operational system four. Operation system four. 
CYBERMAN 3 [OC]: Operational system four complete. Entry to base now completed. 
HOBSON: Entry? How did you get in? 
CYBERMAN 1: It was very simple. Only stupid Earth brains like yours would have been fooled. 
HOBSON: Go on. 
CYBERMAN 1: Since we couldn't approach direct, we came up under the surface and cut our way in through your store room, contaminating your food supply on the way. A simple hole, that's all. 
HOBSON: A hole! That explains those sudden air pressure drops we've been recording. 
CYBERMAN 1: Clever. Clever. Clever.

[Sickbay]

(Polly is looking at her battered finger nails as Jamie tries to get out of bed.) 
POLLY: Hey, what do you think you're doing? You seem to be better. 
JAMIE: Aye, I feel myself again. 
POLLY: Lie back there. 
JAMIE: But I'm better! Oh, my head. 
BEN: Yeah, well take it easy, mate. 
POLLY: At least, you know it's not your McCrimmon piper, anyway. 
JAMIE: It had me worried though, I admit that. 
BEN: Yeah, those Cybermen have got us all worried, mate. We've see them in action before. 
POLLY: They must have some weakness. 
BEN: They have, don't you remember? They can't stand radiation. 
POLLY: But where do we find that here? 
BEN: There's the Gravitron power pack but that's thermonuclear. No one can get near it once its going. 
POLLY: Why not? 
BEN: Well because Duchess, the temperature inside is about four million degrees, that's all. 
JAMIE: Well, in my day, they used to sprinkle witches with holy water. 
BEN: Fat lot of use that would be on them. 
POLLY: Sprinkle. Holy Water. Ben? 
BEN: Yeah? 
POLLY: What are the Cybermen covered in? 
BEN: As far as I know, their suit is a metal of some sort. 
POLLY: Oh. What about that thing on their chests? You know, the part which replaces their heart and lungs. 
BEN: Some kind of plastic, I think. 
POLLY: I thought so. You see, it's simple. Nail varnish remover dissolves nail varnish. Nail varnish is a plastic. So we do what Jamie says. We sprinkle them, see? 
BEN: No, I don't. Clear as mud if you ask me. 
POLLY: Well anyway, I'm going to try an experiment. 
BEN: Yes, Professor.

[Control room]

(Ralph, Evans and Jules enter, followed by a cyberman.) 
HOBSON: Jules! Doctor Evans! I thought he was all dead. I thought they were all dead. 
BENOIT: Better if they were by the look of it. 
CYBERMAN 1: You will leave your places. Go over there. 
(The technicians go to stand by the wall. It speaks to Hobson and Benoit.) 
CYBERMAN 1: You will move. Tell the operators in the power unit to come out. Now. 
HOBSON: All right, you can all see what's happening. Come out. Leave the machine and don't try anything. 
(The power control crew enter the control room.) 
CYBERMAN 1: They will now take over the Gravitron power unit. 
CYBERMAN 2: Yes. 
(The converted men file into the power room.) 
BENOIT: But you can't send them in there without the protective helmets. 
CYBERMAN 1: Why? 
BENOIT: The machine produces very intense sonic fields. Without the helmets, those men will be insane in a few hours. 
CYBERMAN 1: How many hours? 
BENOIT: Twelve, possibly. 
CYBERMAN 1: Then there is no problem. 
BENOIT: Why? 
CYBERMAN 1: Our purpose will be achieved before that. 
BENOIT: But what about the men? 
CYBERMAN 1: They will be disposed of. 
(The Doctor has been watching the cybermen carefully. He edges over to the R/T unit and turns up the volume, then resets it when a cyberman turns.)

[Sickbay]

(Polly has collected lots of bottles.) 
POLLY: Ben? 
BEN: Yeah? 
POLLY: What is nail varnish remover? 
BEN: It's a sort of thinner, something like acetone I think. 
POLLY: Acetone, of course. Great, we've got some of that. Now, keep your fingers crossed. 
(Polly drops some plastic into the acetone and watches it dissolve.) 
POLLY: It's works! 
BEN: But I still don't know what you're on about. 
POLLY: If we can sprinkle some of that on their chest units, it might help to soften them. 
BEN: I get it! You mean it'll clobber their controls or something. 
POLLY: Yes, that's it. 
BEN: Yeah, but how do we know that acetone will dissolve their sort of plastic? 
POLLY: I hadn't thought of that. 
BEN: Just a moment though, if we make up a mixture. 
POLLY: Of all the solvents. 
BEN: What have we got? 
POLLY: Benzene, ether, alcohol. 
BEN: We brew a right old cocktail. 
POLLY: Yes. Wait a minute, how are we going to throw it at them? 
BEN: Well, in bottles, I suppose. Now just a tick though. I've got a better idea.

[Control room]

CYBERMAN 1: Prepare to align the field rectors. 
(The controlled humans obey.) 
CYBERMAN 1: Main power into vortex generators now. Servo pumps to full pressure. 
HOBSON: Why did they go to so such trouble? 
DOCTOR: What do you mean? 
HOBSON: Why didn't they operate the controls themselves? 
(The Doctor goes back to the R/T unit and adjusts the volume and pitch once more. The controlled men lose coordination.) 
CYBERMAN 1: What is happening? 
CYBERMAN 2: There is loss of control. 
DOCTOR: (sotto) Thought so. Sonic control. That should be easy. 
(He resets the dials.) 
DOCTOR: (sotto) Funny. Funny. Go to all that trouble to make the men do the work. Why? Do it themselves, easy. They're using the men as tools. Why? Don't know. Yes, I do though. There must be something in here they don't like. Pressure? Electricity? Radiation? Maybe. Gravity! Now there's a thought. Gravity. Oh, yes. Gravity. 
CYBERMAN 1: Start probe generators. Realign the probe. Probe field to full power now. 
HOBSON: They'll devastate the whole Earth when that field takes hold. 
BENOIT: We've got to do something. 
CONTROL [OC]: Earth Control calling Moonbase. Come in, please. 
CYBERMAN 1: Remain still. 
CONTROL [OC]: Hello, Moonbase. Come in, please. 
CYBERMAN 1: You will all be silent. 
CONTROL [OC]: Moonbase, come in, please. Hello? Reading on five centimetre band. Come in. Your last routine signal was not received. Over. We are not receiving you. Over. If you hear us and cannot transmit, fire sodium rocket. We shall see flare. 
CYBERMAN 1: What does that mean? 
HOBSON: It's a distress rocket. It ejects sodium into space and then the sun lights the sodium into a yellow flare. 
CYBERMAN 1: What will your Earth do if they do not see the flare? 
HOBSON: Well, they'll think we're all dead. They'll do nothing. 
CONTROL [OC]: Standing by to observe flare. Standing by. 
(A cyberman turns the transmitter off. Hobson whispers to Benoit.) 
HOBSON: If they don't get our next transmission, they'll send up a relief rocket.

[Sickbay]

BEN: So, get it? This bottle holds the stuff that puts the fire out and this cylinder pushes gas into the bottle so that stuff squirts out here. Now, all we've got to do is to undo it. Phoar. Empty it and fill it with Polly cocktail. 
POLLY: I've got it all ready here. 
BEN: Good. What did you put in it? 
POLLY: Let's think. Benzene, ether, alcohol, acetone and epoxy-propane. 
BEN: Blimey, one of them should do it. Now, we'll need another one of these. 
JAMIE: Right, I'll get it. 
BEN: No, you stay where you are, Jamie. 
POLLY: Jamie, you're not well enough. 
JAMIE: It takes more than a wee crack on the head to keep a McCrimmon down. 
BEN: Look mate, we don't want you cracking up on us. I'm sure Polly's very impressed. 
JAMIE: Look, I said I was better. Would you like me to prove it to you? 
BEN: Any time, mate. 
POLLY: Look, come on. Haven't we got enough trouble without you two fighting each other? 
JAMIE: I go. 
BEN: Oh well, come on then. Not you, Polly. This is men's work.

[Control room]

(One of the controlled men collapses.) 
HOBSON: You'll kill them. 
CYBERMAN 2: If you will not remain silent you will be put under brain control. 
(The cyberman adjusts his control box and the controlled human jumps up again.)

[Corridor]

BEN: Polly. I thought that I told you to stay behind. 
POLLY: I'm coming with you. 
JAMIE: You'll maybe get hurt. Now go back. 
POLLY: I'm coming with you and that's flat! You still need someone to look after you 
JAMIE: I don't want 
BEN: There's no time for arguments. If you're coming, come on. 
(They go to the control room door.) 
BEN: Now look, we've only got one chance. When I open the door, drop down as low as you can, aim this things at their chests and squirt like mad. Right? 
JAMIE: Right. 
BEN: Now get ready.

[Control room]

(A cyberman hears something outside.) 
CYBERMAN 2: Someone is there. 
(A high pitched noise makes the controlled men freeze.) 
CYBERMAN 1: The beam is jammed. 
(The cybermen turn on the Doctor as Ben, Jamie and Polly burst into the room) 
BEN: Quickly, go and get their chest things! 
(They spray the cybermen's chest units, which instantly bubble and dissolve. Clutching helplessly at their chests, the cybermen collapse.) 
DOCTOR: Quick, get these things off their heads! 
(Ben, Jamie and Polly go into the gravitron room and removed the men's metal helmets. The men pass out.) 
HOBSON: Come on, get to your places! Quick, there's not a moment to lose. We've got to get the Gravitron down to safe level. 
POLLY: What about those poor men? 
HOBSON: Shift them along to the medical unit, quick as you can.

[Space ship]

CYBERLEADER: We are not receiving you. We are not receiving you. 
CYBERMAN 4: They must have failed. 
CYBERLEADER: Yes. We must invade now. Prepare the weapons. 
CYBERMAN 4: Yes.

[Control room]

BENOIT: Before all this, we lost contact with those two men outside. 
HOBSON: Well, send someone else out. 
BENOIT: Can't spare anyone. I'll go myself. 
HOBSON: Field strength is stable, isn't it? 
BENOIT: Yes. Yes, it's all right. 
HOBSON: Keep in R/T contract and be quick. 
BENOIT: Right. 
HOBSON: Nils? 
NILS: Jah? 
HOBSON: Hook your controls into Joe's channel, then get up into the dome and keep a eye on Roger when he's outside. 
NILS: Right.

[Lunar surface]

(By the antennae.) 
BENOIT: Hello Base, Hello Base. I've found them. At least, I've found their suits. They got them, I'm afraid.

[Control room]

HOBSON: Well, there's nothing we can do about that now. You'd better come inside as quick as you can. 
BENOIT [OC]: I will. 
NILS: Sir, sir! There's one of those things outside. He's after Roger Benoit. 
HOBSON: You hear that, Roger?

[Lunar surface]

BENOIT: Yes, I did, but he must be mistaken. There's none to be seen around here. 
(A cyberman appears and draws its weapon.) 
BENOIT: No! No! 
(The cyberman fires his weapon, but nothing happens.) 
BENOIT: Did you see that? Those things don't work in the vacuum!

[Control room]

(Ben is dismantling a fire extinguisher.) 
POLLY: Why can't you squirt it at them like you did just now? 
BEN: Because duchess, it would evaporate in the vacuum before it hits them. There, now come on. 
(Taking the glass cylinder full of solvent mix, Ben runs out. Outside, the cyberman chases Benoit, gaining on him all the time. At the airlock, Ben gets into a spacesuit. Benoit approaches the entry door.)

[Airlock]

(Ben exits the airlock as Benoit enters. Ben throws the glass cylinder at the cyberman's chest unit. It breaks, covering him in a cloud of vapour.) 
BEN: Come on, quick. 
(Ben gets back in with Benoit and they close the outer doors. Outside, the cyberman flails around as it's chest unit dissolves. In the vacuum, no one can hear it scream.)

[Control room]

NILS: They're in! That fellow Ben got one of them. 
JAMIE: That was Ben? 
HOBSON: Now listen, everybody. I don't know how many more of these Cybermen there are, but our point of view we're under siege. I'll reckon they will be back in a bit. Now, communications. Charlie, keep trying to get through to Earth. Right? 
CHARLIE: Right, will do. 
HOBSON: The rest of you, lower the armoured doors at all exits. And you, make up as much of that gubbins as you've got. We may need it. 
(Ben enters, with Benoit leaning on him.) 
DOCTOR: Well done, Ben! 
JAMIE: Well done. 
HOBSON: Ground radar? 
SAM [OC]: Ground radar speaking. 
HOBSON: Have you got a fix on their ship yet? 
SAM [OC]: Yes, Mister Hobson. We're getting a strong pulse from five four degrees north about three kilometres. 
HOBSON: That makes it just over the rim. 
DOCTOR: Mister Hobson, how far can the probe be lowered down? 
HOBSON: About thirty degrees. 
DOCTOR: That's no good. 
HOBSON: What do you mean? 
DOCTOR: Can any other part of it be lowered? 
HOBSON: Well, the main coil lenses can be shifted round without too much trouble, but why do you want to do 
NILS: There's something outside, sir! 
HOBSON: What is it? 
NILS: It's a long way off. 
HOBSON: I'll come.

[Observation dome]

POLLY: Oh, it's freezing. Do you think we should have our suits on? 
BEN: Oh, no, it's all right love. Get a gorgeous suntan. 
(Hobson looks through the telescope.) 
HOBSON: Can't see anything. 
NILS: Just to the left of the launching area. Round a bit to your left. 
HOBSON: Still can't see anything. 
BENOIT: (pointing) No, it's there, look! Reflections in the sun. 
HOBSON: You're right, there is something. 
(Two rows of cybermen march over the crater rim.) 
HOBSON: It's them. They're coming. Everybody inside, quick!

Episode Four

[Observation dome]

(Hobson is looking through the telescope by the gravitron probe.) 
DOCTOR: They can't just march in here, can they? 
HOBSON: Not now we've discovered how they got in. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes. They tunnelled into the store room. 
JAMIE: Doctor, Mister Hobson, come quickly. 
HOBSON: What is it?

[Control room]

CYBERLEADER [OC]: Moonbase. Moonbase. 
NILS: They've got our wavelength. We hear you. 
CYBERLEADER [OC]: You are surrounded. All resistance is useless. You must open the entry port. 
HOBSON: Let me. You're wasting your time. We've discovered your passageway and blocked it. You cannot enter now. 
CYBERLEADER [OC]: Resistance is useless. 
(Hobson turns the radio off.) 
POLLY: Can they get in? 
HOBSON: I don't know and I'm not stopping to find out. Get me Earth as quick as you can. 
NILS: Right. Weather Control Moon calling Earth. Come in, please. 
(Loud static hurts everyone's ears.) 
JAMIE: What's that? 
HOBSON: Switch that off. 
POLLY: What's that terrible noise? 
BEN: It wasn't like that before. 
HOBSON: We'll never hear anything through that if they're jamming it. 
BENOIT: Perhaps, or could it be. 
HOBSON: The aerial. They're having a go at the aerial. 
BENOIT: Where are you going? 
HOBSON: Out. 
BENOIT: You're crazy. They'd get you in a flash. 
HOBSON: Well, someone's got to go. 
DOCTOR: It's too late. Come and see.

[Observation dome]

(Through the telescope we see two cybermen destroying the antennae.) 
HOBSON: They get us every way, these creatures. 
DOCTOR: I refuse to believe that. Everything's got a weak point. It's just a question of waiting until it shows up, that's all.

[Control room]

BENOIT: They're bound to send a relief rocket within 12 hours, if no signals are received from us. 
BEN: A lot of good that is. 
NILS: Well, with all the trouble we've been giving them I'd say it's certain the rocket is on its way, sent off hours ago. Rinberg's very quick off the trigger, right, Hobby? 
HOBSON: I'm sure of it. With a replacement for me aboard, no doubt. 
POLLY: But that's wonderful! 
HOBSON: Thanks very much. 
POLLY: No, what I mean is, what are we all worrying about? The Cybermen can't get in and help is on its way. 
BEN: Ah, it all sounds too easy for my liking. 
HOBSON: Get the scanner lined up on the flight path between moon and Earth. Let me know the moment you spot anything. 
NILS: Right. 
HOBSON: All we have to do, Doctor, is to hold on here. 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all. It doesn't depend on us, though. 
BEN: What do you mean? 
DOCTOR: It depends on what the Cybermen are hatching up. If a rocket is on it's way, they're bound to be aware of that already.

[Space ship]

CYBERLEADER: Emergency. Emergency. There is a spaceship approaching from Earth. It will arrive on the lunar surface in 15 minutes. Immediate offensive action must be taken.

[Lunar surface]

CYBERMAN: They have blocked up our way into the base. Other methods to gain entry will be tried.

[Space ship]

CYBERLEADER: The machine from Earth must first be destroyed. There are 14 minutes left. 
CYBERMAN [OC]: Understood.

[Lunar surface]

CYBERMAN: Transmit control signal. 
(A second cyberman operates a device, which emits a high-pitched whine.)

[Sickbay]

(The light above Evans' bed flashes and he sits up. He puts a cybercontrol device on his head and moves towards the attendant, no 6, Sam Becket, whom he hits over the head with an object he has picked up.)

[Lunar surface]

(The cyberman speaks into the control device.) 
CYBERMAN: You will listen to me and follow my instructions.

[Control room]

BENOIT: Switch on again. 
NILS: Without an aerial? 
BENOIT: We can pick up local signals. 
NILS: Local? Oh I see, the Cybermen. 
BENOIT: If they have any more words of cheer for us we might as well hear them. 
NILS: Right.

[Sickbay]

(Evans picks up a weapon.) 
CYBERMAN [OC]: Those are your orders.

[Control room]

(Ben is being taught how to operate a console.) 
BENOIT: That is correct, but watch the digital counter. 
BEN: Right. 
HOBSON: How's he shaping? 
BENOIT: Not bad for a beginner, I suppose, but it will take a long time yet. 
HOBSON: Well, at least the gravitron's stable at the moment. I don't know how they can take it for long in that room. 
BENOIT: How's Benson standing up to it? 
HOBSON: He's 
BENOIT: He's been on for 6 hours on the trot. 
HOBSON: He says he'll be all right for the time being. 
BENOIT: Yes I know, but should he be on it alone? 
HOBSON: Who else have we got? You're the only other operator who could replace him and you're needed right here. 
BENOIT: Well, it's a bit tough on him, isn't it? 
HOBSON: I know, Roger. It's tough on all of us but the lives of millions of people depend on this weather control unit. 
POLLY: Here we are. I've brought us all some coffee to keep us awake. 
BEN: Without sugar this time, I hope. 
POLLY: Of course. Don't remind me. 
HOBSON: Take some to the Doctor. He's in the dome. 
POLLY: Right. 
HOBSON: Ben. 
(Polly walks past Evans, who is wearing Sam's tabard and standing by the gravitron control door.)

[Gravitron control]

(Unnoticed, Evans goes into the room and knocks out Benson, then takes off the man's protective helmet.) 
CYBERMAN [OC]: You will now change field co-ordinates as instructed. 
(Evans puts the helmet on and sits down.)

[Control room]

BEN: Doctor! They've spotted it on the scanner. 
DOCTOR: What? 
BEN: The relief ship. 
POLLY: Ben, where? 
BEN: Over here. 
DOCTOR: Let's see. 
HOBSON: Well? 
NILS: No doubt about it. I told you they would be on their way. 
POLLY: That's a spaceship? 
BEN: No, that's the scanner. 
DOCTOR: It's not far off. 
HOBSON: Far off? It's coming in now off parking orbit. It'll be down in six minutes. 
POLLY: Well, don't you think you ought to warn them? 
BEN: Yeah, the Cybermen will be waiting for them. 
HOBSON: Don't worry, they've got their own warning system and weapons. They'll blast the Cybermen and their spaceship to kingdom come in about four minutes from now. 
(The radar blip moves to the centre of the screen.) 
POLLY: Come on, come on. It seems to move so slowly. 
(The blip carries on to the other side of the screen.) 
BENOIT: What are they doing? 
JAMIE: Looks like they've changed direction. 
HOBSON: They've changed into an escape orbit. Follow it. 
NILS: But it's going too fast. I can't keep up with it. 
HOBSON: Well, keep trying. 
NILS: I can't hold it. It's accelerating too fast. 
(The screen goes white.) 
BENOIT: Look out, man. You're on the sun. 
NILS: But that's where it's heading. 
BENOIT: The acceleration, it's gigantic! 
HOBSON: Get R/T contact with the ship. 
NILS: No good, sir. The Doppler effect. It's going too fast. 
BENOIT: They've had it, I'm afraid. 
HOBSON: The sun. 
BENOIT: Yes. 
POLLY: Will somebody please tell us what it all means? 
BENOIT: The rocket has been deflected towards the sun. Nothing can save them now. 
POLLY: Save them? What are you talking about? 
BENOIT: From plunging into the sun. 
BEN: But the sun's millions of miles away. 
BENOIT: Once they get into the sun's gravity belt they can't change course. It may take a week but they'll end up there just the same. 
HOBSON: What on earth could have caused it? 
BENOIT: The rocket was deflected off course, but why and how? 
DOCTOR: Deflected? Yes, of course. The gravitron. 
HOBSON: Have the Cybermen got a gravity weapon, do you think? 
DOCTOR: No, they haven't but we have. 
HOBSON: You're not suggesting that 
DOCTOR: There's only one way that rocket could have been deflected into the sun. From this very room! 
BENOIT: I see what you mean. 
HOBSON: Of course, the gravitron. Benson, he must 
BENOIT: I told you he'd been on duty too long. 
DOCTOR: If it is Benson. 
(They look through the gravitron control room. Evans turns around.) 
HOBSON: It's Evans! 
BEN: But he was in the medical room! 
DOCTOR: They must have got control of them again. 
BEN: And the other men in there? 
DOCTOR: They may not be affected yet. Get along to the medical room. Barricade the door with everything you can find. Keep them in there at all costs! 
JAMIE: Right.

[Sickbay]

(The other men are being activated. Number 10 and two others get up.)

[Outside Sickbay]

JAMIE: Well, that's all right. We haven't passed any of them. 
BEN: Well, maybe it was only Evans who's been reactivated. 
JAMIE: Aye. We'd better keep watch just here. 
BEN: We could stick that thing against the door 
JAMIE: It wouldn't hold them for long, I'm thinking. 
BEN: They're not Cybermen, mate. They're just flesh and blood like us. Come on, get hold of the other end. 
(They start to carry the metal table when Jamie drops his end.) 
BEN: Hey! 
JAMIE: Behind you! 
(A man starts to walk through the door.) 
BEN: Quick! Ram him! 
(Number ten get the thin metal rammed into his stomach. He falls back.) 
BEN: Press the locking button. 
JAMIE: It won't hold for long, will it. 
BEN: No. Look, get those chairs and we'll block 'em in. 
(The controlled men use a strip of metal to prise the doors apart.)

[Control room]

HOBSON: Evans, can you hear me? Listen, Evans, this is Hobson talking. Evans, you've got to concentrate. Your brain has been altered by the Cybermen. You're being controlled by them, anyhow. We've got one or two of those things as well, you know. You can't shoot all of us so why not be a good fellow and come out of there. 
BENOIT: What's he doing in there? Look at the field reactors. 
HOBSON: Huh? 
BENOIT: We must get back control soon. He could flood half of Europe if he keeps the gravitron aligned with spring tides. 
HOBSON: That settles it, we'll have to rush him. Get those weapons out. 
CYBERLEADER [OC]: Resistance is useless. All further ships from Earth will be deflected. Open the airlock to us. If you do not we shall destroy the base and you will be eliminated. 
HOBSON: Can you hear me? 
CYBERLEADER [OC]: Everything you have said in the past half hour has been overheard. 
HOBSON: Well you can hear this too, then. We're not done yet and we'll fight you to the last man. You'll never get inside this base. 
CYBERLEADER [OC]: We are in it already. 
(There's a bang and everyone clutches their throats and hangs on as the air rushes out.) 
HOBSON: They've punctured the dome! 
BENOIT: The oxygen masks! Quick everyone, take a mask. Over there. 
(Nils, Ben and Jamie get to a set of three masks in the ceiling. The Doctor has got one at the console Polly is hanging on to.)

[Observation dome]

(The dome is cracking.) 
BENOIT: I do hope we don't lose too much oxygen. 
HOBSON: Can we patch it, do you think? 
BENOIT: We can try. 
HOBSON: Give me a hand off, will you? 
(Benoit helps Hobson take off his lab coat.)

[Control room]

POLLY: Doctor, I can't breathe! 
(The Doctor tries to pass her a mask.) 
DOCTOR: Put this on your face.

[Observation dome]

(Hobson and Benoit plug the crack with the coat.) 
HOBSON: Oh, thank heavens. I can breath again. 
(The coat starts to get sucked through the hole.) 
BENOIT: Oh no! 
(The coat is sucked through the hole and flies across the moon.) 
HOBSON: Is there anything else we can patch it with? 
BENOIT: No, nothing. Wait. Over there. 
(It's the coffee tray.) 
HOBSON: Slide it to me but don't let go of it. We have to do it in one action. No second chance. Okay, ready? 
BENOIT: Oui. 
HOBSON: Now! 
(This firmly blocks the hole and the pressure gauges rise again.) 
HOBSON: Stopped them for the moment. 
BENOIT: I wonder for how long. 
HOBSON: Well, let's have a look.

[Control room]

DOCTOR: Polly! Are you all right? 
POLLY: Oh yes. Oh. Oh, where's that air coming from? 
NILS: Reserve tanks of oxygen. 
POLLY: Oh. Well why couldn't we have had those before? 
NILS: And lose all our oxygen? 
POLLY: Oh, I see. It's so quiet. 
DOCTOR: Yes, it is, isn't it. The gravitron's stopped! 
(Evans is slumped over the console.) 
DOCTOR: Quick, before he comes to! Ben, Jamie!

[Gravitron control room]

NILS: Joe! 
BEN: We've barricaded the sick bay with half the tables and chairs in the base but it won't hold forever, Doctor. 
(The Doctor takes the helmet and control piece off Evans.) 
DOCTOR: Well done, Ben. Here's another one for you. 
[Control room]

JAMIE: What do we do with him, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: That's your problem. Just make sure he doesn't come back here for a while. 
BEN: Blimey, I'll be after a job as a copper when I get back to 1966. 
(Ben and Jamie leave with Evans. The Doctor puts the control device inside his coat.)

[Observation dome]

DOCTOR: Mister Hobson, I've got an idea. 
HOBSON: Doctor, what do you make of this? 
DOCTOR: Made by a laser beam, I would think. 
HOBSON: Is there anything known to science the Cybermen haven't got? 
DOCTOR: Well they haven't got a gravitron or they wouldn't be after yours. 
HOBSON: We'll just have to stand guard in here with their cyberguns. 
BENOIT: Not much use, I'm afraid. They are getting reinforcements. 
HOBSON: What? 
BENOIT: Looks like another of their spaceships. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, there. 
(A classic flying saucer lands.) 
HOBSON: Another one! 
(And a second.) 
CYBERLEADER [OC]: We have brought up reinforcements with other weapons. You have one chance. You must open the entry port. You cannot stop us now. You will all be completely destroyed. 
POLLY: What does he mean, other weapons? 
NILS: We'll soon find out. You stay here. I must report this to Mister Hobson. 
(Nils leaves Polly in charge of the R/T.)

[Lunar surface]

(Cybermen are unpacking crates.)

[Space ship]

CYBERLEADER: I shall count to ten. If you still stupidly remain silent. we shall fire. One

[Observation dome]

NILS: Hobby! They've got another weapon. They're going to 
HOBSON: Yes, I know. There it is. Everybody take cover. Get down, all of you! 
(The Doctor stays standing.) 
HOBSON: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Is the gravitron still switched on? 
HOBSON: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Then I shall certainly stay here.

[Lunar surface]

(A group of cybermen aim a weapon at the base.) 
CYBERLEADER [OC]: Nine, ten. Fire. 
(A beam goes towards the base then 'bounces' off it. For some reason, this cyberweapon has recoil. Don't ask. ) 
CYBERLEADER [OC]: Again. Fire. 
(Once again the beam bounces off the base.)

[Observation dome]

HOBSON: What happened? 
DOCTOR: It just deflected over the dome. 
(The Doctor sways.) 
BENOIT: Doctor, are you all right? 
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. 
HOBSON: The gravitron deflected it. The force field. 
DOCTOR: Yes, and that gives me an idea. What are they doing now? They're packing it away. 
HOBSON: What'll they cook up next, I wonder? 
DOCTOR: How far down can this be aimed? 
HOBSON: Down? 
DOCTOR: Can it be brought to bear on the surface of the moon? 
BENOIT: I see! 
HOBSON: Ah, well, I don't 
DOCTOR: Has it ever been tried? 
BENOIT: No, but we should try! 
DOCTOR: With Evans gone, the gravitron is all yours. 
BENOIT: Splendid! Je m'en occupe! 
HOBSON: It can only go to here. Any further down and the field may affect the base. 
DOCTOR: What does that matter now? 
HOBSON: Well, I suppose you're right. 
DOCTOR: Get someone to stand by that window and relay instructions direct to Benoit. 
HOBSON: Right. 
(Benoit puts on a helmet and goes into gravitron control. Polly is by the window to relay instructions. Thumbs up are sent.) 
HOBSON: He's ready. 
DOCTOR: Start moving the probe down. 
(The message is relayed. The approaching cybermen stop advancing and spread out. They draw their weapons. Benoit signals that the gravitron won't go any lower.) 
HOBSON: That's as far as it'll go. 
DOCTOR: What? But it's way over their heads. There's one chance. We'll try bringing it down by hand. 
HOBSON: Right. 
DOCTOR: Is this still switched off? 
HOBSON: Yes, it's off. 
DOCTOR: Round the back. 
HOBSON: It won't go. 
DOCTOR: All your weight, once more. No, it's no use, it won't shift. 
HOBSON: Ah, stupid of me. Of course it won't. 
DOCTOR: Why? 
HOBSON: Well, the angular cut out. It's obvious, isn't it. You see, there's got to be a safety cut out on the angle of the probe otherwise it might affect the whole base. There, that's done it. No, no, no, stand back. Benoit can do it now. 
DOCTOR: Polly! 
HOBSON: Switch on! 
(As the gravitron comes down to level with the moon's surface, the cybermen start to float up and away, followed by their saucers. Big cheers from the assembled team.) 
DOCTOR: We did it! 
HOBSON: Well, that's taken care of the Cybermen. Now then, everybody, we've got to get this gravitron in operation again as fast as we can. 
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry we damaged it. 
HOBSON: What? Oh, yes.

[Control room]

HOBSON: Nils, rig up a temporary aerial. Call up Space Control. Tell Rinberg we will be operational in er, oh about two hours. He won't like it but it's the best we can do. 
NILS: Right. 
HOBSON: Two hours, that's all we've got to get the world's weather back under control again. Benoit, take charge of your side. 
(Meanwhile, the Doctor, Ben, Polly and Jamie quietly leave.) 
BENOIT: Right. 
HOBSON: And Doctor, what the? Oh well, perhaps it's just as well. We've got enough madmen here already. Now come on, I want to see your first weather plot in two minutes. 
BENOIT: Right, come on boys.

[Lunar surface]

(Safely suited up, the travellers take a last at the Moonbase before approaching the Tardis doors.) 
POLLY: Doctor, look. 
(A comet-like object is streaking through space.) 
POLLY: Could that be them? 
DOCTOR: Possibly. And I hope it's the last we see of them. 
(They all enter the Tardis and it dematerialises.)

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: There we are. In perfect flight. 
POLLY: Yes, and look what happened last time. 
DOCTOR: Oh, that. What a lot of fuss. Just a bumpy landing, that's all. It won't happen again. I know. 
BEN: What are you up to now? 
DOCTOR: Let's have a look at the time scanner. 
POLLY: The what? 
DOCTOR: The time scanner. Instead of the normal picture showing where we are, it gives you a glimpse of the future. 
JAMIE: The second sight? Very dangerous. 
DOCTOR: Oh nonsense. I haven't used it very much. It's (cough) not very reliable, as you can see. 
POLLY: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Hmm? 
POLLY: Look! 
(The scanner shows an image of a giant claw.)

[Gatwick airport runway]

(The Tardis materialises in the middle of a runway. Jamie and the Doctor come out.) 
JAMIE: It's a flying beastie! 
(An aeroplane is coming in to land, flaps down. Jamie and the Doctor run, followed by Ben and Polly. It aborts its landing, missing them and heading off back into the sky. A patrolling policemen sees the running group.) 
POLICEMAN: Hey, you! Stop! 
DOCTOR: Scatter. 
(Ben goes one way, while the Doctor, Jamie and Polly go another. The policemen intercepts Ben.)

[Air Traffic Control]

COMMANDANT: The pilot said what? 
MEADOWS: A police box on the runway. 
COMMANDANT: A likely story. Tell him to get back into stack and await further instructions. 
MEADOWS: Yes sir. 
COMMANDANT: Miss Rock, get the Airport Police. 
MEADOWS: Gatwick Control, Sugar Delta X-Ray. Return to stack. 
COMMANDANT: Police? Commandant here. In-bound aircraft reports obstruction on intersection of runways Five and Two. Investigate and report back. Police Box. 
(Two motorcycle police ride off to investigate, then escort a low-loader carrying the Tardis off the runway. The policeman has failed to catch Ben. The Doctor and Jamie are hiding behind the wheels of a parked aeroplane.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, come over here with me. Come on. 
(Polly comes out of a hangar to see the policeman walking away, so she ducks back inside.)

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

SPENCER [OC]: Just a minute. 
(A grey-suited man comes down some wooden stairs.) 
SPENCER: Give me that envelope! 
(Spencer is an airline pilot, and he is pointing an alien weapon at the man.) 
SPENCER: I would advise you to stop. 
(There's a pulsing sound and the man drops. Spencer picks up the envelope the man was carrying and drags the body a short way before covering it with what looks like parachute silk, then leaves. Polly has seen all this from behind some crates.)

[Chameleon tours secret office]

(Spencer walks through an ordinary looking office, twists a can on a shelf and a secret door opens into a high-tech room. He turns on a monitor.) 
SPENCER: Can you come quickly? Trouble. 
BLADE [on monitor]: Trouble? What happened? 
SPENCER: The postcards. Someone found them. 
BLADE [on monitor]: Right. 
(Transmission ended, a buzzer sounds. A surveillance camera shows Polly uncovering the body.)

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

(Polly runs as Spencer comes out, weapon ready. Outside the hanger, Spencer is about to fire at her when the motorcycle police ride past. He puts the weapon away and goes back inside. Elsewhere, Ben watches the Tardis being delivered to a hangar.)

[Air Traffic Control]

COMMANDANT: (into phone) All right, all right. So you dumped it by number four hangar, but what was it? It was a police box? (to Jean) Get me the police chief. All right, you can bring those planes down now. The obstruction's been cleared. 
MEADOWS: Right, sir. 
JEAN: Do you think it was some kind of practical joke, sir? Students or maybe someone? 
COMMANDANT: Well, whoever it was they're going to pay for it as soon as I get my hands on them. I'm not going to have the lives of passengers endangered by practical jokers or anyone else. 
JEAN: Superintendent Reynolds? I have the Commandant for you. The Chief of Police. 
COMMANDANT: Listen, what's all this about a police box on the runway? Oh. Well, security's got to be tightened up all round. He reports that four suspects were seen running away from it. 
JEAN: Did they catch them? 
COMMANDANT: No. Idiot of a policeman lost them. They're probably miles away by now. Get me Immigration. Tell them to let me know if any suspicious characters are seen in the area.

[Airport]

(The Doctor and Jamie are hiding under another aeroplane.) 
JAMIE: There's Polly! 
DOCTOR: Polly! Over here! 
POLLY: Doctor, I've just seen a man killed. 
JAMIE: Hit by one of the beasties? 
POLLY: No, no. He was murdered by another man. 
DOCTOR: Get your breath, Polly, and tell us exactly what happened. 
POLLY: Well, I went into the hangar to get away from a policeman, and there were two men in there. One of them had a gun and he shot the other one. 
DOCTOR: The murderer, did he see you? 
POLLY: Well, he chased me, but I managed to lose him. 
DOCTOR: Could you find this hangar again? 
POLLY: Well, I think so. I can remember the name. It was Chameleon something or other. Hey, where's Ben? 
DOCTOR: We haven't seen him. Come on, let's find this hangar. 
POLLY: But listen. The bloke with the gun, he'll be looking for me. 
JAMIE: Ah, we'll look after you. Now come on. 
POLLY: But where's? What about Ben? 
JAMIE: Aye, we'll find him. Come on.

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

(Blade is another pilot.) 
BLADE: Who was he? 
SPENCER: He found the postcards. 
BLADE: His name? 
SPENCER: I don't know. I caught him in the office. He found evidence. I had to stop him. 
(Blade checks the man's wallet.) 
BLADE: You killed Detective Inspector Gascoigne. A policeman. 
SPENCER: Do you think a parent sent him? 
BLADE: Possibly. It's doesn't matter The important thing is that nobody should find him. Arrange disposal.

[Chameleon Tours office]

SPENCER: All right. Get it over here as quickly as possible. A container is on the way. 
BLADE: Right. Destroy this. Why have you left those suitcases there? 
SPENCER: The detective. He interrupted me. 
(Spencer puts the suitcases and wallet through a panel in the wall. There's a whirring sound each time. Then the buzzer sounds.) 
BLADE: Spencer! 
POLLY [on monitor]: Look. And, Doctor, the bloke came out of that door there. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Is it locked? Is anyone in there? No, its locked. There's nobody there.

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

DOCTOR: Polly, this man that killed him. Would you recognise him again? 
POLLY: Well, yes. He chased me. I'd recognise him anywhere.

[Chameleon Tours office]

BLADE: Fool.

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

DOCTOR: Polly, how do you say he was killed? 
POLLY: With a gun. 
DOCTOR: Can you describe it to me? 
POLLY: No. It was too far away. Why? 
DOCTOR: This man was electrocuted. His clothes are all scorched! 
POLLY: It was definitely some kind of a gun, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Maybe. But not one that's not been developed yet on this planet.

[Chameleon Tours office]

BLADE: This man they call Doctor, where does he get his knowledge? 
SPENCER: He looks like a normal being. 
BLADE: More intelligent then most. He is a threat to our operation. 
SPENCER: I'll kill him. 
BLADE: No. Get the girl. She can identify you. We can deal with the man later. 
SPENCER: He may talk. 
BLADE: So? Nobody will believe him.

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

DOCTOR: We must report this to the authorities. 
JAMIE: That man who chased us. We could find him maybe. 
DOCTOR: What, the policeman? Oh, no, no, Jamie. We must find the man in charge in this place. 
POLLY: But what about him? We can't just leave him here. 
DOCTOR: There's nothing else we can do. Now, let's find the main airport building. Come on.

[Gatwick airport]

(Spencer is hiding in another hangar as Jamie and the Doctor walk past.) 
JAMIE: Are you sure this is the right way, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: This seems to be leading to the main airport building. 
(Spencer grabs Polly and fires a pen-like device at her. She is silent as he drags her away.)

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

POLLY: Oh, what happened to me? 
SPENCER: A temporary disablement. You'll be back to normal any second now. Up here. 
POLLY: Where are you taking me? 
SPENCER: You'll soon find out.

[Chameleon Tours office]

SPENCER: I've got her. 
BLADE: Excellent. Did anybody see you this time? 
SPENCER: She was following behind her friends, but they didn't notice. 
POLLY: They'll come looking for me. 
BLADE: Sit down. 
POLLY: Murderers. 
BLADE: You'll have to show us some respect, and answer my questions. Which airline do you work for? 
POLLY: I don't understand. 
BLADE: You must belong to some airline or the airport authority to be in this part of the airport. 
POLLY: I've got nothing to do with the airport. We'd just arrived. We were lost. I was trying to find someone to help me and I saw him kill a man. 
SPENCER: You say you'd just arrived? How did you get here? 
BLADE: We'll gain nothing by questioning her. The important thing is that we've got her. 
POLLY: You don't think my friends are just going to forget me like that, do you? 
(The buzzer sounds.) 
JAMIE [on monitor]: I don't understand it, Doctor. Polly's nowhere to be seen. Something must have happened to her. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: It's locked Jamie. There's nobody there. 
(Polly tries to hammer on the door but Spencer grabs her.)

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

DOCTOR: I'm afraid we're wasting our time here, Jamie. The sooner we find the authorities and tell it all to them, the better. Come on. 
JAMIE: All right.

[Chameleon Tours office]

BLADE: Yes, you're right. Your friends are worried about you. Well then, we shall have to do something to stop them worrying.

[Immigration]

TANNOY: Would Doctor Scott, passenger recently arrived from Alderney on flight number JY17, please return to the ticket desk.
DOCTOR: This seems to be the way, Jamie. 
(They come to passport control.) 
DOCTOR: Excuse me, we're looking for someone in authority. 
JENKINS: Just a moment, sir. All in good time. Thank you, Madam. Now, sir, your passport please. 
DOCTOR: I've got no time for that. We want to see someone in authority! 
JENKINS: I am in authority. Your passport, please. 
DOCTOR: You don't understand. We have something important to report. 
JENKINS: Yes, sir. When you've found your passport. The next one, please. 
JAMIE: What's a passport, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Some sort of official mumbo-jumbo. Look! We've just discovered a dead body out there. Did you hear me? 
JENKINS: Well, sir. If I were you I'd inform the police. 
DOCTOR: Then please tell me where we can find them. 
JENKINS: There's probably a policeman in the main concourse, 
DOCTOR: And where is that? 
JENKINS: Through this door and turn to your left. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. Thank you very much. Come on, Jamie. 
JENKINS: May I see your passport, sir? 
DOCTOR: We neither of us have passports! Now does that satisfy you? 
JENKINS: I think you must be mistaken, sir. You couldn't have got on the aircraft without passports. 
DOCTOR: What aircraft? 
JENKINS: The one you arrived on, sir. 
JAMIE: We didn't arrive on an aircraft. 
JENKINS: Now look here, sir, this joke's gone on far enough. You know and I know that you must have arrived here on the last inbound flight, which was flight number 729 from Madrid. 
JAMIE: Can we not tell him about Tardis? Ow! 
(The Doctor stamps on Jamie's foot.) 
JENKINS: What's that? 
JAMIE: It's the way we got here. 
JENKINS: You gentlemen wouldn't know anything about a police box, would you? 
JAMIE: That's just what I'm saying. We're. Ow! 
DOCTOR: I really think that our mode of conveyance is irrelevant. The important thing is that we've discovered a dead body out there and we want to report it to someone in authority. 
JENKINS: I think you'll have plenty of opportunity to see someone in authority. 
DOCTOR: Well, thank you. 
JENKINS: Will you take a seat please, over there? 
DOCTOR: Thank you very much. 
(Jenkins makes a telephone call.) 
JENKINS: Give me the Commandant, please. Hello, sir, Jenkins here. Immigration desk number five. I think I've got two of your suspects here.

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

(Ben is walking past the hangar when he hears hammering. He goes inside to investigate. Blade is fastening a large crate before going into the office.) 
BEN: Anyone here? There must be someone around. Anyone here? 
JEAN: Oh, hello, Is Captain Blade about? 
BEN: Well, I don't know. I'm a bit lost. 
BLADE: Are you looking for me? 
JEAN: Yes, I have your flight schedules here. They're all in order. 
BLADE: Thank you. 
JEAN: Goodbye. 
(Jean leaves.) 
BLADE: And what do you want? 
BEN: I'm looking for the way out, mate. 
BLADE: This is private property. Visitors are not welcome. Do you belong to the airport staff? 
BEN: Yeah, I started today. But I didn't mean to come in here. I just got lost, see. 
BLADE: Are you sure? 
BEN: Of course I am. Look, are you going to direct me or not? 
BLADE: Yes, of course. Come on, I'll show you the way.

[Immigration]

COMMANDANT: You say this girl actually witnessed a murder? 
DOCTOR: Yes, she saw the man killed. 
JAMIE: He was electrocuted with a ray gun. 
COMMANDANT: A what? 
DOCTOR: Oh, what does it matter what sort of gun. The point is he was killed and my friend saw it happen. 
COMMANDANT: Where is she? I'd like to talk to her. 
JAMIE: Well, that's another thing. She's vanished. 
COMMANDANT: Oh, people who vanish, ray guns. Is this some sort of joke? 
DOCTOR: You wouldn't think it a joke if you'd come and see the body. 
COMMANDANT: What flight did these people come in on? 
JENKINS: Well sir, they came with the passengers from flight 729 from Madrid, but they've no passports. 
COMMANDANT: Perhaps you'd kindly explain why you have no passports? 
DOCTOR: Oh look, we're all wasting time. Now, are you going to come and see that body, or am I going to find someone who really is in charge in this place? 
COMMANDANT: I am in charge in this place, thank you. Now, you'll both accompany me to this hangar immediately. 
DOCTOR: Well thank you. Thank you very much. At last. 
COMMANDANT: Tell Air Traffic Control where I am. 
JENKINS: Yes, sir. Immigration desk number five here. Number One's just gone to the hangar area. He wanted me to let you know. As a matter of fact, he has just gone to look for a dead body. Yes, It's going to be one of those days, isn't it.

[Chameleon tours office]

(Blade selects a postcard of the Eiffel Tower, puts a French postage stamp on it then repeats with the next postcard.) 
BLADE: Get her? 
SPENCER: She's being processed. They can take another on the next flight. 
BLADE: Excellent. 
(Blade takes a hypodermic syringe from a tray, then opens a cabinet door. An inhuman arm reaches out. He injects it then the buzzer sounds.)

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

JAMIE: The body, it's gone. 
COMMANDANT: You're quite sure you got the right hangar? 
JAMIE: Aye, the name's up outside. The body was lying just here. 
DOCTOR: Well, let's see what we have got, shall we? 
(The Doctor uses a magnifying glass to examine the concrete floor.) 
COMMANDANT: What exactly are you doing? 
DOCTOR: For the police, of course. The trouble is, I can't tell them who he was. 
COMMANDANT: Some sort of mystery man, no doubt? 
DOCTOR: Yes, as a matter of fact he was. There was nothing in his pockets to identify him. 
COMMANDANT: Oh, a man with nothing in his pockets? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I was rather surprised myself. No, wait a minute, there was one thing. 
COMMANDANT: What did he have in his pocket? 
DOCTOR: This. 
COMMANDANT: A postage stamp? 
DOCTOR: Ah, but it's Spanish and it hasn't been used. 
COMMANDANT: Oh, I am sure that'll make all the difference. 
DOCTOR: Exactly. Hello, this is interesting. 
COMMANDANT: What have you found now? 
DOCTOR: It's burnt fibres. 
JAMIE: What about this, Doctor? This wasn't here before. It's a burn mark. 
DOCTOR: You're right, Jamie. That's quite new. Well, it's good to see someone is using their intelligence. 
COMMANDANT: Oh, I've had enough of this. You two are coming with me. 
DOCTOR: That was definitely made by a ray gun. 
COMMANDANT: Ray gun, burnt fibres, foreign stamps. 
DOCTOR: Unused foreign stamps. 
COMMANDANT: All right, unused foreign stamps. I must be as mad as you are even to be listening you. 
DOCTOR: You know what they've done with it, don't you? 
COMMANDANT: Done with what? 
DOCTOR: The body. Somewhere there's a large packing case. 
JAMIE: Right behind you, Doctor. 
(Jamie starts to pull at the lid. It says made in Poland, by the way.) 
BLADE: Can I help you? 
COMMANDANT: Are you connected with Chameleon Tours? 
BLADE: Yes. I'm Captain Blade, Chief Pilot. 
COMMANDANT: Ah, these gentlemen seem to think there's an incident happened in here. 
BLADE: An incident? 
COMMANDANT: Would you mind if we had a look in this packing case? 
BLADE: May I ask who you are? 
COMMANDANT: I'm the Commandant. 
BLADE: Yes, of course. What you expect to find? 
JAMIE: A dead man. 
BLADE: How very interesting. 
(Blade opens the case with a crowbar.) 
COMMANDANT: Plastic cups! Now, I'm going to do some investigating of my own. 
DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad I've roused your interest. 
COMMANDANT: Oh, but you have. And what I am going to investigate is you and why you're both here in the airport. Thank you, Captain Blade. Come on, you two. Out! 
DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie. We'd better humour him. 
(The Commandant, the Doctor and Jamie leave.) 
BLADE: Bring him down. 
(A figure is helped to the stairs.) 
BLADE: It's all right. 
(All we can see is an inhuman hand.) 
SPENCER: Will he survive? 
BLADE: If we hurry. 
SPENCER: There you are. We've got to get you to the airport building and you'll be safe. 
BLADE: He's reaching suffocation point. Hurry.

[Immigration]

DOCTOR: If you'd had let me search the place properly we might have found 
COMMANDANT: That hangar is leased to a private charter company. I've no right to search in there, let alone you. Now, will you kindly sit down and keep quiet. Jenkins, get on to Superintendent Reynolds. This is his job. These people are trespassing. 
JENKINS: I've just got another flight coming through, sir. 
COMMANDANT: All right, I'll do it. 
JAMIE: Doctor, look! 
(Polly has arrived at the desk and is getting out her passport. Meanwhile, Spencer and Blade are helping the mysterious figure up an escalator and through the airport concourse.) 
DOCTOR: Commandant, this is the girl I was telling you about. 
POLLY: I beg your pardon? 
COMMANDANT: Do you know these gentlemen? 
POLLY: No. Why, should I? 
COMMANDANT: According to them, they know you. 
DOCTOR: Now where have you been, Polly? 
POLLY: Polly? My name isn't Polly. You must have made a mistake. I've never seen them before in my life

[Medical centre]

(Spencer and Blade take the figure through to the rear, into the x-ray room and it sits on an examination table. It is struggling to breathe.)

Episode Two

[Medical centre x-ray room]

(Blade pulls back a screen to reveal Meadows lying unconscious on another table.)

[Immigration]

COMMANDANT: You're quite sure you've never met these men? They say they know you. 
MICHELLE: But they can't know me. This is my first visit to England. 
JAMIE: But Polly, it's us. Me and the Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Would you mind telling us your name? 
MICHELLE: I am Michelle Leuppi from Zurich. 
DOCTOR: You have a passport? 
MICHELLE: Yes, of course. Here. Have I done something wrong? 
COMMANDANT: Oh no, I don't suppose there's anything for you to worry about, Miss. May I just ask what you're doing in England? 
MICHELLE: I've come here to work. Look, here is my work permit. 
COMMANDANT: Oh, yes, that's quite in order. Thank you. Excuse me. 
DOCTOR: Where did you learn such excellent English? 
MICHELLE: I had an English governess. Would you mind telling me what's happening? 
COMMANDANT: Nothing that need concern you, miss, everything's perfectly order. Now, if you'd just like to go through there. 
POLLY: Thank you. 
(Polly lookalike Michelle leaves.) 
JAMIE: Polly, wait! 
COMMANDANT: Just a minute young man. 
JAMIE: But she's a friend of ours and she saw the murder! 
COMMANDANT: You're going to wait here until the Superintendent of police arrives, now understand that. 
DOCTOR: Ah, you're going to tell him about the dead body. Very sensible. 
COMMANDANT: No. I am going to tell him about you. Put me through to Superintendent Reynolds, please. 
DOCTOR: (sotto) Jamie, I don't think we're very welcome here. When I say run, we run. 
COMMANDANT: Hello, Super? Commandant. I've got a couple of illegal entrants here. Yes. Immigration desk number five. 
DOCTOR: Run! 
JENKINS: Commandant! 
COMMANDANT: Situation changed. They've just made a run for it. I'll give you their description.

[Medical centre x-ray room]

(A nurse enters.) 
BLADE: Quick, he's suffocating. 
PINTO: You were twenty minutes late. 
(She gets two arm bands from a cupboard, one black and one white. There is a tiny control panel in each one. Blade puts the white one on Meadow's forearm, while Spencer attaches the black one to the alien.) 
BLADE: Who is he? 
PINTO: Meadows, Air Traffic Control. 
BLADE: Good. He may be useful to us. 
(The nurse puts headsets on both bodies and switches on the machine they are attached to. Meadows begins to twitch and the alien goes rigid.)

[Concourse]

(Two policemen stride through the passengers. The Doctor and Jamie are sitting next to a newsstand, hiding behind broadsheets. Jamie has chosen a foreign one, and is holding it upside down.) 
JAMIE: They're still hunting for us, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes. We'll have to keep out of their way until we can prove our story. 
JAMIE: A fine chance we have of doing that with Polly kidding on she doesnae know us. 
DOCTOR: I don't think Polly was kidding on. In fact I don't think that was Polly. 
JAMIE: Of course, it was Polly. You saw her. 
DOCTOR: You don't want to believe everything you see, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Doctor. 
(The policemen are coming back.) 
JAMIE: All clear, Doctor. 
(The Doctor is reading his paper.) 
JAMIE: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Jamie, what was the name of that hangar? 
JAMIE: Polly said Chameleon something. 
DOCTOR: Yes, Chameleon Tours. An advertisement for Chameleon Youth Tours. Budget Tours for young people between the ages of eighteen and twenty five. 
JAMIE: What do they mean by budget? 
DOCTOR: Inexpensive, cheap. This could be the bait. Do you know what a chameleon is, Jamie? 
JAMIE: It's just a name, I suppose. 
DOCTOR: It's the name of a small animal, a lizard that can change it's colour to merge with it's background. But it's a name that could equally be applied to people as well. People who change their personalities to suit their own ends. Budget Tours. Young people between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five. Oh yes, there's something strange going on here. 
BEN: Doctor! Jamie! 
DOCTOR: Ben, are you all right? 
BEN: Yeah, I'm okay. 
JAMIE: Well that's a relief. 
BEN: What happened to you two, and where's Polly? 
DOCTOR: We can't talk here. We've got to find somewhere to hide. Something about passports. 
BEN: I've got the very place. Come on.

[Medical centre x-ray room]

(The features of the alien are turning into those of Meadows. The real Meadows is covered with a sheet now. Nurse Pinto switches off the machine.) 
BLADE: Is he all right? 
PINTO: We'll see. 
(She stabs the alien with a pin.) 
MEADOWS 2: Ow! 
(They help him to sit up facing an eye test chart.) 
PINTO: Read the first line. 
MEADOWS 2: (slurred) E T 
PINTO: Vocal control. 
(Blade adjusts a dial on the arm band.) 
BLADE: Try that. 
MEADOWS 2: H X O A 
(Stoppers are removed from two chemical bottles. Meadows 2 sniffs at one and likes it, but recoils from the other. ) 
PINTO: All complete. 
(She hands a personnel file to Blade.) 
BLADE: Who are you? 
MEADOWS 2: My name is George Meadows. I work at Air Traffic Control, Gatwick Airport. 
BLADE: Where do you live? 
MEADOWS 2: Number Ten, Sylvia Avenue. 
BLADE: Number Ten? 
MEADOWS 2: Until last week we lived at Number Thirty-Four. I've been too busy to tell the Personnel Department of the change. 
BLADE: Excellent,

[Concourse]

(The Doctor, Ben and Jamie are walking along when Ben sees someone at one of the kiosks.) 
BEN: Look, there's Polly. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Look who she's working for. 
JAMIE: Chameleon Tours. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Leave this to me. Polly. 
MICHELLE: Please go away. 
DOCTOR: Now, something has happened to you, Polly. I want you to try to remember up to the time we left the hangar. 
MICHELLE: I don't know what you're talking about. 
DOCTOR: Now think, Polly. There were three of us in the hangar. You were showing us something. Now, what was it? 
MICHELLE: I tell you, I don't know what you're talking about. 
DOCTOR: The hangar, Polly. The Chameleon Hangar. You said you'd seen the man who did it. 
MICHELLE: I didn't see anything. I think you're mad. If I'd seen anyone shot, I'd have gone to the police. 
DOCTOR: Anyone shot? 
MICHELLE: I mean murdered 
DOCTOR: I didn't say anyone was shot or murdered, Polly. 
MICHELLE: (upset) Look, please, will you just leave me alone. 
(The Doctor returns to Ben and Jamie.) 
BEN: What's happened to her, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I don't know, but I mean to find out. Come on, let's find that place where we can talk. 
BEN: Right. 
(As Michelle watches them leave, she is being watched by Blade on a monitor in a room at the rear of the kiosk.)

[Chameleon tours cubicle]

BLADE: Come in here. I was going to brief you for this assignment, but there isn't any purpose now. 
MICHELLE: I have failed then? 
BLADE: Circumstances are against you. I'll make arrangements for you to leave on the next flight. 
MICHELLE: Back to base. 
BLADE: Yes. 
MICHELLE: What about that man? He's very persistent. 
BLADE: Don't worry about him. We have ways of dealing with such people.

[Air Traffic Control]

(Meadows 2 relieves another air traffic controller. Jean Rook enters and sees the Commandant being questioned by a man with a slight Scottish accent and smoking a pipe.) 
CROSSLAND: Are you sure you haven't seen him, sir? 
COMMANDANT: I'm quite sure. Oh Jean, this is Detective Inspector Crossland. Give him any help you can. If you'll excuse me? 
CROSSLAND: Yes, of course, sir. 
JEAN: Well now, Inspector, what can I do for you? 
CROSSLAND: Well, I think I'll need a pass for a start. 
JEAN: Well, that's easily arranged. Anything else? 
CROSSLAND: Yes, I was supposed to meet a colleague of mine here. Detective Inspector Gascoigne. 
JEAN: Yes? 
CROSSLAND: Well, he was investigating a missing person off one of your charter flights. The funny thing is, he hasn't shown up. 
JEAN: Detective Inspector Crossland. What shall I say your business is? 
CROSSLAND: Investigation into Chameleon Youth Tours.

[Photo booth]

(Three grown men into one photo booth doesn't really go.) 
JAMIE: What is this place? 
BEN: It's a machine that takes your photograph. 
JAMIE: Photograph? 
BEN: Well, you see, you've got your 
DOCTOR: No, Ben, not now. What puzzles me is this girl pretending to be Polly, yet in a way she is Polly. 
BEN: Do you think she's been brainwashed? 
DOCTOR: No, not in the time. Whatever happened to her happened to her in a few minutes. Look out. 
(The curtain is pulled back by an elderly lady. Surprised, she pulls it back again and leaves.) 
DOCTOR: All right. Now Ben, Jamie, we've got to find out more about Chameleon Youth Tours, but the trouble is, we're not free to move around with the authorities looking for us. 
BEN: Well, they're not looking for me. 
DOCTOR: No, that's true. You could investigate the hangar. 
BEN: (Leave it to me. Now what about you? 
DOCTOR: I'm going back to the Commandant and try and convince him that there's a murderer abroad. 
JAMIE: Well I'll go with Ben. 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie, I want you to find your way back to the Chameleon kiosk and keep an eye on Polly. 
(The come out of the booth and split up. Jamie is a little lost and wanders around.) 
TANNOY: Further call for flight BR129 to Geneva now boarding through channel B at gate number 19.

[Chameleon Tours kiosk]

(A dark-haired liver bird approaches, played by Pauline Collins. She could have been a companion if she'd wanted the long-term job.) 
SAMANTHA: Oh, er, are you in charge here? 
MICHELLE: Yes. Can I help you? 
SAMANTHA: Yes. I'm Samantha Briggs and I've come down from Liverpool. 
MICHELLE: Oh, really. 
SAMANTHA: It's about my brother, Brian Briggs. 
MICHELLE: What about him? 
SAMANTHA: He went on one of your tours, and now he's disappeared. 
MICHELLE: I'm sorry, I don't follow. 
SAMANTHA: Well, it's really very simple. I tried to get the telephone number of the hotel you sent him to, and the operator said there was no such place. 
MICHELLE: Well, the operator must have been mistaken then. 
SAMANTHA: So, I got in touch with the police and they said that Brian wasn't staying at any hotel in Rome. 
MICHELLE: Well, perhaps he changed his mind and decided to go off on a different tour then. 
SAMANTHA: Yes? Well what about this then? A postcard from Brian posted in Rome. 
MICHELLE: Yes, that does seem odd, doesn't it. Er, would you like me to make some enquiries, for you? 
SAMANTHA: Well, what do you think I've come all the way down from Liverpool for? 
MICHELLE: Well, since you've put the matter with the police, why have you? 
SAMANTHA: The police. They said that dozens of people go missing every week and they haven't got the men to go chasing after them all. 
MICHELLE: I see. What did you say your brother's name was? 
SAMANTHA: Brian Briggs. Would you like me to spell it for you? 
MICHELLE: That won't be necessary, thank you. I'll see what I can find out, if you don't mind waiting.

[Chameleon Tours cubicle]

(Michelle calls up the office on the monitor.) 
MICHELLE: Is Captain Blade there? 
SPENCER [on monitor]: No. 
MICHELLE: Well, I must speak with him urgently. Enquiries about a missing passenger. 
SPENCER [on monitor]: I'll tell him to contact you. He shouldn't be long.

[Chameleon Tours kiosk]

MICHELLE: The gentleman I wanted to speak with wasn't available. They're trying to find him. Do you want to wait? 
SAMANTHA: Well, I've got nothing else to do, have I? I'll be over there. 
(She goes to sit near Jamie, who is hiding behind another newspaper.) 
SAMANTHA: Oh, blast. 
JAMIE: Is anything the matter? 
SAMANTHA: Stuck up thing! 
JAMIE: What? 
SAMANTHA: Not you. That girl. She just couldn't care less. 
JAMIE: About finding your brother. 
SAMANTHA: Yes. 
JAMIE: I couldn't help overhearing. Do you think something's happened to him? 
SAMANTHA: Well, that's just it, I don't know. Oh, Brian can take care of himself all right, but still. 
JAMIE: Aye, well I hope you're right. 
SAMANTHA: What do you mean? 
JAMIE: I might just be able to help you. I can't tell you anything at the moment but later I'd like you to meet a friend of mine. I'm sure he'll know what's best. 
(Jamie hides behind his newspaper as a policeman walks past.)

[Air Traffic Control]

JEAN: Excuse me, sir. There's a gentleman to see you. 
COMMANDANT: Did he say what about? 
JEAN: Well yes. It's about a dead body. 
COMMANDANT: Bring him in. 
JEAN: Would you come in, please? 
DOCTOR: Thank you. Ah, Commandant. How nice to see you again. 
COMMANDANT: (into telephone) Airport Police please. 
DOCTOR: At least hear what I have to say. 
COMMANDANT: I've heard all I want to from you. What do you mean, they're engaged. This is the Commandant. Thank you. 
DOCTOR: If you're going to speak to the police, then tell them that there's something happening in this airport that may endanger human lives. 
COMMANDANT: Hello, police? Commandant. Would you send a couple of men down here at once please. 
DOCTOR: Well, since I'm obviously about to be arrested, may I make one last request? Listen to me for just one minute! 
COMMANDANT: Not for one second. I've heard all I want to hear about burnt fibres, ray guns, disappearing people. 
DOCTOR: But there was a dead body in the Chameleon Tours hangar. 
JEAN: Did you say Chameleon Tours? 
DOCTOR: Why, do you know something about it? 
JEAN: Well no, but the Inspector Crossland wanted to know 
COMMANDANT: All right, Jean. I'll handle this. Take this man away, put him under lock and key and keep him there. 
DOCTOR: One step nearer and I'll blow you all to smithereens! Catch! 
(The Doctor has gone, leaving the Commandant holding a small rubber ball.) 
COMMANDANT: All right, after him.

[Chameleon Tours office]

BLADE: That's quite clear, is it? You know what to tell her? 
MICHELLE [on monitor]: I do. 
BLADE: As soon as you've got rid of the girl, close the kiosk and get on the next flight.

[Chameleon Tours kiosk]

MICHELLE: Miss Briggs. 
SAMANTHA: Yes. Have you found anything? 
MICHELLE: Er, well yes, I have, but I'm afraid it doesn't help very much. Your brother definitely did get on our flight to Rome, but what he did when he got off the plane, I couldn't tell you. 
SAMANTHA: Well, if you can't, who can? 
MICHELLE: Miss Briggs, we're dealing with thousands of passengers every week. We can't keep track of every single one. If I were you, I'd go back to Liverpool. I'm sure your brother will turn up eventually. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to close this kiosk. 
SAMANTHA: Thanks for nothing. 
(Polly/Michelle puts a Closed sign on the counter and Samantha goes back to Jamie.) 
SAMANTHA: There's something funny going on here. 
JAMIE: Why? 
SAMANTHA: My brother's vanished, and that lot just couldn't care less.

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

(Ben has returned to an empty hangar. There are new packing cases in one corner, so Ben levers one open. It contains a catatonic Polly, eyes staring at nothing. Ben runs upstairs.)

[Chameleon Tours office]

(Ben grabs the telephone.) 
BEN: Hello? What's the name of the man who's in charge of this airport? The Commandant? Right, well look, can you put me through to his office, please? All right, then Air Traffic Control. But I want to speak to a friend of mine who should be with the Commandant right now.

[Concourse]

JAMIE: Doctor, I'd like you to meet this young lady. 
DOCTOR: What young lady? Where's Polly? 
JAMIE: She's still inside. 
DOCTOR: Ah, I shan't be a minute.

[Chameleon Tours cubicle]

DOCTOR: Polly. 
(It is empty. There's a model aeroplane on the desk and the monitor shows the concourse. A search of the desk produces blank postcards from various foreign countries, together with sheets of unused foreign stamps. The Doctor fiddles with the model plane and the monitor picture changes. First the medical centre, then the hangar office.) 
BEN [on monitor]: But why wouldn't you listen to him? It's all true. I'm in the Chameleon Hangar now and I've just f 
DOCTOR: Ben! Ben, can you hear me? 
(Spencer has walked in and fired a pen-shaped device at Ben. ) 
DOCTOR: Ben, can you hear me? 
(Ben is rigid.)

[Chameleon Tours office]

(Spencer hangs up the telephone.) 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Ben, are you all right? Can you hear me? Ben! Ben! Ben, can you hear me? 
BLADE: Who is he? 
SPENCER: A friend of that Doctor on the screen. 
BLADE: Did he see what happened in there? 
SPENCER: He must have done. 
BLADE: Then he'll be coming here. We'd better be prepared for him. First, dispose of the body.

[Immigration]

JENKINS: Who is he? 
CROSSLAND: His name's Brian Briggs. He's supposed to have come through here about a week ago on holiday. 
JENKINS: Thousands of people come through here in a week. 
CROSSLAND: Aye, well it was just a chance. Do you remember that man? 
JENKINS: Oh yes, I remember him. He had a pass. But I can't remember his name. 
CROSSLAND: He's a colleague of mine. Detective Inspector Gascoigne. Now when did he come back? 
JENKINS: I couldn't tell you. There are so many faces. There was a bit of bother this morning. He could have slipped through then. 
CROSSLAND: What sort of bother? 
JENKINS: Two people without passports, who told some story about a body in a hangar. 
CROSSLAND: What happened? 
JENKINS: Ah, it was all a hoax. These two men they ran away. The airport police are still looking for them. 
CROSSLAND: Can you describe them to me? 
JENKINS: One was a scruffy-looking man, medium-height, wearing a frock-coat. the other was a Scots boy dressed in a kilt. 
CROSSLAND: Oh, they shouldn't be too hard to find.

[Concourse]

SAMANTHA: Hey, you think we should go after your friend? He's been gone about ten minutes now. 
JAMIE: No, he said half a hour. Now we'll do what he said. 
SAMANTHA: Hey, he's a right weirdy, isn't he? 
JAMIE: No! I wish I had his brains. 
SAMANTHA: You're all right as you are. 
(Sam moves closer to Jamie. A woman in airline uniform - Ann Davidson - removes the closed sign from Chameleon Tours' kiosk.) 
TANNOY: Chameleon Youth Tours announced the departure of their flight Number 413 to Zurich. Will all passengers please assemble in the departure lounge. Chameleon Youth Tours ann 
SAMANTHA: Hey. Hey, look, they've opened up that kiosk now. 
JAMIE: Aye, and where's Polly? 
TANNOY: Will all passengers please assemble in the departure lounge.

[Chameleon Tours office]

(The Doctor finds Spencer's pen weapon. He knows he saw Spencer leave the room on the kiosk monitor, but there are no doors in the right direction.) 
DOCTOR: Packing cases.

[Concourse]

(The uniformed woman is addressing the group of youths at the kiosk.) 
ANN: I'm quite sure the first thing you want to do when you get to Switzerland is write home to your parents, but in case you don't have time, Chameleon Tours have some postcards of Zurich ready for you to write here. When you've finished your postcards, give them back to me and we'll post them for you in Zurich. 
SAMANTHA: Er, do you mind? 
MAN: No, go ahead. 
SAMANTHA: Look, a postcard of Zurich, stamped with a Swiss stamp, all ready to post. 
JAMIE: Well? 
SAMANTHA: Oh, you're a right one, aren't you. Don't you see. This could explain the card I got from Brian. It was posted in Rome, but that doesn't mean to say that he posted it. 
JAMIE: Oh, I see. We'd better tell the Doctor about this. How long's he been gone? 
SAMANTHA: Er, about half a hour, now. 
JAMIE: Right, I'll go and find him. 
SAMANTHA: I'll come with you. 
CROSSLAND: Just a minute, son. I want a word with you.

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

(The Doctor is also trying to open a packing case. He finds Meadows staring back at him.) 
SPENCER [OC]: Somebody help me, please. I'm suffocating. Quickly, somebody help me, please. I'm suffocating.

[Chameleon Tours office]

SPENCER [OC]: Help me, please! 
(A panel closes over the loudspeaker that the voice was coming from. The Doctor enters and a shutter closes over the door, trapping him. Then a grill opens in the wall and vapour seeps into the room. The Doctor falls to his knees, suddenly very cold. In fact, he's freezing.)

Episode Three

{From the Lost In Time DVD)

[Chameleon Tours office]

(The Doctor manages to block the icy gas with his handkerchief, so Spencer flicks another switch and more gas comes out of an upper nozzle instead. The Doctor stands on a chair and blocks that too. Then he notices the CCTV camera and hangs his jacket over it. Spencer slides the door panel aside and comes out of the secret room to find the Doctor lying on the floor. He goes over and gets dosed with his own pen weapon. The Doctor retrieves his coat and makes his escape, leaving Spencer stiff on the floor. The Doctor runs out of the hangar past the still Meadows wearing the white armband.)

[Concourse]

(By the Chameleon Tours kiosk.) 
SAMANTHA: Yeah, but what about me brother? 
CROSSLAND: I'm afraid I've got something more serious to look into first, Miss. If this young man's telling the truth, a colleague of mine's been murdered. 
JAMIE: Ah, Doctor. There's a man here wants to talk to you. 
DOCTOR: Oh, who is he? 
JAMIE: Er 
CROSSLAND: There you are, sir. 
DOCTOR: Detective Inspector Crossland, Scotland Yard. 
JAMIE: Aye, I've told him everything. 
CROSSLAND: Have you ever seen that man? 
DOCTOR: Well, that's the man we found in the Chameleon Tours hangar.

[Chameleon Tours office]

(Spencer blinks and sits up. Blade enters.) 
BLADE: The Doctor's body. Where is it? 
SPENCER: He escaped. His intelligence is far above normal beings. 
BLADE: Above yours, perhaps. I must leave. the flight to Zurich is ready to take off. You will remain here. 
SPENCER: For what purpose? 
BLADE: To atone for your incompetence. The Doctor must die, and you must do it.

[Concourse]

CROSSLAND: All right then, Doctor, we'll go and see the Commandant. I want him to hear your story. 
DOCTOR: Well, he wasn't every impressed with it the last time. 
CROSSLAND: This time, he's going to believe you. 
DOCTOR: Well, if you think so. Jamie, stay here and keep an eye on the kiosk. We shan't be long. 
CROSSLAND: And don't worry about your brother, Miss. We'll find him for you. 
(The Doctor and Crossland leave.) 
SAMANTHA: A fat lot of good that Inspector's going to be. 
JAMIE: Ah, but he believes us. 
SAMANTHA: Oh yeah, but that doesn't mean to say he's going to do anything. I think I'll go and have a look round that Chameleon Hangar. 
JAMIE: Ah, not by yourself. 
SAMANTHA: Well, I suppose it would be better if I had a man with me. 
JAMIE: Aye. Oh, if only the Doctor hadn't told me to watch this place. 
SAMANTHA: Oh, do you always do everything you're told? 
JAMIE: No. But the Doctor trusts me. 
SAMANTHA: Yeah, that's your trouble isn't it. All right, stay here. After all, they can only murder me. Ta-ra. 
JAMIE: No, wait a minute. I don't suppose anything'll happen here, do you? 
SAMANTHA: Well since they closed the kiosk, it's hardly likely. 
JAMIE: And we won't be long away, will we? 
SAMANTHA: Well, that depends on what we find. Ah, come on, kid. 
JAMIE: In any case, you'll need me to show you the way there.

[Air Traffic Control]

COMMANDANT: All right, all right, I'll accept that you found a body, but I still want to know where you come from and why you have no passport. 
DOCTOR: Oh, but surely that's unimportant. If 
COMMANDANT: It is not unimportant to break the law. 
CROSSLAND: Sir, I think we're going to have to let him tell us in his own way. 
COMMANDANT: Oh, very well. Make it brief. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. I have just carried out a search of the Chameleon Tours hangar. In a packing case, I found the body of a man. 
CROSSLAND: You never told me that, Doctor. Another dead man? 
DOCTOR: No, he was in a stupefied state, a sort of coma. 
COMMANDANT: Who's this one? 
DOCTOR: I don't know his name but I have a feeling he's one of your employees. 
COMMANDANT: Oh, indeed. 
DOCTOR: In fact, I think he may be in here. 
(The Doctor tours the ranks of air traffic controllers.) 
MEADOWS 2: Taxi, following southern taxi way for departure runway two seven. 
DOCTOR: Do you know what this is? 
COMMANDANT: It looks like a fountain pen to me. 
DOCTOR: Things are not always what they seem. Oh careful, it's dangerous. Chameleon Tours are not quite what they seem either. 
COMMANDANT: Oh? And what's your theory? 
DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid you won't believe it when you hear it. However. First, Inspector Gascoigne was murdered with a ray gun. 
CROSSLAND: A ray gun? 
DOCTOR: A weapon that has not yet been developed on this Earth. 
COMMANDANT: Oh, really! 
DOCTOR: There, you see? I knew you wouldn't believe it. What's the use? 
CROSSLAND: No, now be patient, sir. We are trying to understand you. 
DOCTOR: Very well. Next, I believe Chameleon Tours to be merely a front, a cover. 
COMMANDANT: For what? 
DOCTOR: For the mass kidnapping of young people. 
COMMANDANT: And is all this supposed to be taking place in my airport? 
DOCTOR: Yes, at this very moment! 
COMMANDANT: Oh, that's quite enough. Can't you take that fellow into custody? 
CROSSLAND: Well, I'm very sorry, sir, but you know he hasn't broken any law, except for this immigration business, and that's not my responsibility. 
DOCTOR: But Brian Briggs is your responsibility. 
COMMANDANT: And who is he? 
DOCTOR: He's a young man who went on a Chameleon Tour and vanished. 
CROSSLAND: Now, come on Doctor, wait a minute. We're not certain of that yet. 
DOCTOR: Well, he's nowhere to be found. 
CROSSLAND: Well, no. 
DOCTOR: And neither are my two friends. Which to my mind proves my point. Chameleon Tours are a cover for the abducting of young people. 
COMMANDANT: And just where do you think they're taking them? 
DOCTOR: Well, in view of the facts that I've already presented, the ray gun, this pen and one or two other things, I think we're dealing with people who are not from this planet. 
COMMANDANT: That hardly answers my que. What did you say? 
DOCTOR: You see, I knew you wouldn't believe me. 
COMMANDANT: Oh, this is absolute, arrant nonsense/ 
CROSSLAND: Er, look, Doctor, I think you ought to produce some evidence to support all this. 
DOCTOR: Evidence? What about this pen? 
COMMANDANT: A pen! Do you call that evidence? 
DOCTOR: I'll demonstrate it for you. Excuse me. Would you mind helping us? 
MEADOWS 2: I don't understand. 
DOCTOR: Could you hold this cup out in front of you? 
MEADOWS 2: Very well. 
(Meadow stands, holding the cup, then sees the pen weapon.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, perhaps you've seen one of these before? 
MEADOWS 2: No, no I 
(The Doctor fires at the cup, Meadow drops it and runs. Jean picks up the pieces.) 
JEAN: It's turned to ice. 
DOCTOR: Do you call that arrant nonsense?

[Chameleon Tours office]

(Samantha finds the envelope of pre-stamped postcards home.) 
SAMANTHA: Dear Mum and Dad, have arrived safely in the Black Forest. Will write again soon. Love, Tim. Dear Dad, I. Dear Mum. Jamie!

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

(Jamie is searching a packing case.) 
SAMANTHA: Jamie, look what I've found. There must be fifty postcards here. That should make that inspector do something. 
JAMIE: Aye, you're right, and I know where to find him. You're a brave wee lassie. No time to greet now. 
SAMANTHA: Oh, get off. I've got something in me eye. Come on. Where are we going? 
JAMIE: The Commandant's office.

[Air Traffic Control]

(The Doctor is sitting at a desk, looking over a sheaf of papers.) 
JEAN: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Hmm? 
JEAN: Here are the remaining flight schedules for Chameleon tours you wanted. 
DOCTOR: Thank you, my dear. 
COMMANDANT: What a nasty little device. 
CROSSLAND: I think I'd better get that checked over, sir. 
(Jamie and Samantha rush in.) 
COMMANDANT: What the devil? 
JAMIE: Doctor! Samantha, down here. Doctor, picture postcards. Look at them. 
COMMANDANT: This is the limit. I will not have my control room invaded. 
DOCTOR: What, not even for these? 
CROSSLAND: Why? What have you got there? 
DOCTOR: I think it's the further evidence you required, Inspector. Yes, just as I thought. 
CROSSLAND: Where'd you get these? 
SAMANTHA: In the office in that hangar. You see what they mean? 
DOCTOR: All falling into pattern. This envelope is addressed to somewhere in Germany. 
SAMANTHA: Yeah, Dem Chameleon Reisen, Freiberg. That means Chameleon Tours. 
COMMANDANT: Just what are you all talking about? 
SAMANTHA: Well, you see. They give out these cards and get the kids to write home to their parents before they go. Then the Chameleon Tours lot take the cards abroad and they post them back to Britain. 
CROSSLAND: So the parents think the children have arrived safely. 
SAMANTHA: Doctor, what do you think does happens to them? 
COMMANDANT: Now, now, now, this is all mere supposition. 
SAMANTHA: Oh, to you, maybe. But one of those kids happens to be my brother. 
COMMANDANT: Your brother? 
CROSSLAND: Aye, sir. This is the young lady whose brother's missing, and you see, she did get a card from him in Rome. 
COMMANDANT: But why would anyone want to abduct these young people? 
DOCTOR: Well, if we knew that we wouldn't be sitting here. 
COMMANDANT: Inspector, can I have a word with you? 
(They move away from the desk.) 
COMMANDANT: You don't think this fellow's a little unbalanced, do you? 
CROSSLAND: Oh maybe a wee bit unorthodox, sir, but after all, he's given us the only lead we've got so far. If you could just see your way to giving him a free hand. 
COMMANDANT: A free hand? 
CROSSLAND: Just to poke around a little bit, sir. 
COMMANDANT: Do you think it's safe to let the fellow roam round the airport? 
CROSSLAND: You can rely on us to keep an eye on him, sir. 
COMMANDANT: All right, but on your head be it. 
CROSSLAND: I personally will investigate Chameleon Tours. Then I'll report back to you here if I've found out anything. But in the meantime, if you could just keep everything going as normal, you understand? We don't want them to get wind of anything. 
COMMANDANT: No, no, no, no, no. Doctor, I'll give you the freedom of the airport for twelve hours, heaven help me. At the end of that time I shall expect you back here with some real facts this time. 
DOCTOR: Thank you, Commandant. 
(Samantha hugs Jamie.)

SPENCER: Did they believe the Doctor? 
MEADOWS 2: I don't know. 
SPENCER: What do you mean? 
MEADOWS 2: I think he suspects me. He turned one of our own weapons on me, forced me to leave. 
SPENCER: You fool. You should have stayed. Now we do not know how much he has discovered. 
MEADOWS 2: Even if he has discovered the secret of our mission here, they will never believe him. These Earth minds cannot stretch that far. 
SPENCER: Of course, the truth is beyond their intelligence. Except for that Doctor. 
MEADOWS 2: I know where he is. I could kill him. 
SPENCER: You're going to, but not at the risk of your own safety. We still need you in Air Traffic Control. 
(Spencer takes a button-sized item from a filing cabinet drawer.) 
SPENCER: Here, take this attach it to him. When we are ready I shall activate the mechanism with this. That should put paid to him once and for all. 
MEADOWS 2: Very well. 
SPENCER: Don't delay. I want him dead before Captain Blade returns.

[Air Traffic Control]

(The group are by an Air Traffic Controller separate from the main group, watching the radar.) 
JEAN: Doctor, I've made out a pass for you and for your two friends. 
DOCTOR: Thank you very much. 
HESLINGTON: Excuse me, sir. There's a Chameleon flight coming in now. 
DOCTOR: Ah. 
BLADE [OC]: Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima calling Gatwick Airport control. 
HESLINGTON: Gatwick Control to Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima. 
(Meadows enters.) 
HESLINGTON: Gatwick Control to Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima. I will now give you your heading. 
DOCTOR: How many flights do they use a day? 
JEAN: Seven or eight. 
DOCTOR: How many planes do they use? 
JEAN: Four. I could get their registration numbers if you like? Why do you ask? 
DOCTOR: Eight flights a day and only four planes. Is that normal? 
JEAN: Oh, yes. They have a very quick turn around. I mean, after all they're only on short haul flights. You know, all the holiday centres. Spain, Rome, Athens, the Black Forest. 
COMMANDANT: Jean, where's the file on winter schedules. 
JEAN: Excuse me. 
DOCTOR: Which is the Chameleon plane? 
HESLINGTON: Oh that one, sir. Look, he's turning left at Dunsfold. I shall hold him now over Epsom until I can give him landing clearance. 
DOCTOR: What's the range of your radar? 
HESLINGTON: Hundred and thirty miles, sir. Why? 
DOCTOR: I was just wondering when this plane first appeared. 
HESLINGTON: I've no idea, sir. We don't notice them till they start to call in. Oh, excuse me a moment. Gatwick Control to Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima. Climb to ten thousand feet and hold in Epsom control zone to wait landing clearance. 
BLADE [OC]: Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima to Gatwick Airport. Climbing to ten thousand feet and holding. 
HESLINGTON: Ah, you were saying, sir? 
DOCTOR: How long do you hold them after take off? 
HESLINGTON: Once they've left Gatwick control zone we've finished with them. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. That means they might be anywhere. 
COMMANDANT: Aren't you rather wasting your twelve hours hanging around here, disturbing my people? 
DOCTOR: I don't think I've been wasting a minute, but I'll go if you insist. Sam, Jamie. 
(Meadows bumps into the Doctor and puts the little device on his back.) 
MEADOWS 2: Sorry. 
DOCTOR: Oh, it's all right. It's quite my fault. Haven't I met you somewhere before? 
MEADOWS 2: I don't think so. 
DOCTOR: You must have a double.

[Chameleon Tours kiosk]

(Spencer is manning the desk. He finishes dealing with a young lady.) 
SPENCER: Okay, thank you. 
CROSSLAND: Excuse me, are you the manager? 
SPENCER: I'm looking after bookings. Can I help? 
CROSSLAND: I'd rather like to speak to the manager. I'm a police officer. 
SPENCER: Is there some trouble? 
CROSSLAND: I'd prefer to speak to the person in charge. 
SPENCER: Well, that's Captain Blade. He's just returned from one flight, he's taking off for another. He's rather busy at the moment. 
CROSSLAND: Perhaps I could go out to the plane. 
SPENCER: I'll have to see about that. Just a moment, please.

[Chameleon Tours cubicle]

SPENCER: A detective wants to see you. 
BLADE [on monitor]: Does he suspect anything? 
SPENCER: I don't know. 
BLADE [on monitor]: All right, send him over to the plane. We'll deal with him.

[Chameleon Tours office]

JAMIE: Are you sure this is the right room, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Jamie, have you ever known me to be mistaken? 
JAMIE: Aye. 
DOCTOR: Hey. Now watch out. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: That's the wall the gas-nozzles came out of. 
JAMIE: Well, there's nothing here now. 
DOCTOR: You're right. Well, that's clever. That's very clever. Oh well, makes life simpler for us. Now, the man I froze came from here somewhere. 
JAMIE: Aye, he would. A solid wall. 
DOCTOR: Well. somewhere in that solid wall there's a door. 
JAMIE: Aye, and we still haven't found Ben and Polly. What do you think's happened to them? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. Perhaps if we find that door, we'll find them. Come on, you take that end, I'll take this. 
JAMIE: Right. 
(The Doctor starts emptying the shelves from the bottom.) 
DOCTOR: We must hurry. Inspector Crossland's keeping them busy at the moment, but he'll be no match for them. If he presses them too far.

[Aeroplane]

(Ann Davidson is taking passenger's jackets and putting them in the overhead compartments.) 
BLADE: You'll find that the whole plane conforms strictly to the International Standards of air safety. I can't think why anybody should have complained about us? 
CROSSLAND: Did I say anyone had complained? I'm not enquiring about safety. My enquires are about a missing boy. A passenger on one of your flights. And there's also the business of a colleague of mine, Detective Inspector Gascoigne, who was last seen in your hangar. He's believed to have been murdered. 
BLADE: That is indeed a much more serious matter. 
CROSSLAND: Aye, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to hold up this flight a while, while I ask you some questions. If you wouldn't mind coming to the Commandant's office? 
BLADE: Well, if you'll just excuse me for a moment, Inspector, I have some arrangements to make. 
ANN: Excuse me, please. 
CROSSLAND: Aye, I'm sorry lass. 
(Blade and Davidson go forward. Crossland even thinks about lighting his pipe. Then the engines start up. Crossland goes forward.)

[Flight deck]

CROSSLAND: Captain Blade. 
(This is not a standard flight deck. No throttle controls or the usual displays.) 
BLADE: I shouldn't move any further if I were you. This gun proved remarkably effective in dealing with your colleague, Inspector Gascoigne. 
CROSSLAND: You killed him. 
BLADE: Unfortunately an error. You Earth men are more use to us alive. Sit down there. 
(Ann straps Crossland into the seat.) 
BLADE: That's better. This Earthman is a particularly fine specimen, don't you think? 
ANN: Perhaps the Director himself. 
BLADE: Exactly. 
CROSSLAND: Look, I don't know what you two are planning for me, but I must warn you of the long arm of the British law. 
BLADE: I don't think it'll reach where you're going. Chameleon Flight four one three to control. Request start up.

[Chameleon Tours office]

(The last item on the shelf is the control to the secret room.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, look! 
JAMIE: Hey.

[Chameleon Tours room]

(The door slides shut behind them. The Doctor opens a large cabinet with a sort of air conditioning unit inside.) 
JAMIE: What's that, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Someone who's not used to the Earth's atmosphere. Very interesting. Ah, a TV monitor set. Let's see what we can see. 
JAMIE: Hey, what's that? 
DOCTOR: Well it looks like a hospital. Jamie, we're getting warmer, which is a change from the last time I was here. Come on, let's see if there's a First Aid post in Gatwick Airport.

[Chameleon Tours office]

JAMIE: Should we clear up the mess, Doctor?

[Chameleon Tours cubicle]

DOCTOR: No, let's get along to the first aid post. 
(Spencer uses his remote control device to activate the 'button' on the Doctor's coat.)

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

DOCTOR: Oh, my back! 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: Jamie, my back! 
(The Doctor collapses. Jamie spots the device and picks it off his jacket before stamping on it. He clutches his fingers after touching it.)

[Aeroplane]

ANN: Please take a barley sugar. Thank you. 
(Now the passenger can deal with the change in air pressure. She moves on.) 
ANN: You can unfasten your seat belts now. Thank you. Barley sugar? Thank you. Everything all right?

[Flight deck]

ANN: All set. 
BLADE: Good. 
(Blade switches on a monitor which tracks down the full passenger section.) 
BLADE: You wanted to know what was the secret of Chameleon Tours. Well, Inspector, see for yourself. 
(Blade turns dials, there's a loud whining sound, then suddenly all the passenger seats are empty.)

Episode Four

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

(Jamie is trying to wake the Doctor.) 
JAMIE: Doctor! 
SPENCER: He's dead. You're coming with me. 
JAMIE: I'll not leave him. 
SPENCER: You have five seconds to change your mind. 
JAMIE: You'll have to kill me then. 
SPENCER: I said five seconds. Five, four, three 
JAMIE: Samantha! 
(Samantha jumps out of hiding. Spencer turns and Jamie jumps him, making him drop the pen weapon. Samantha kicks it away, but Spencer has a second one and uses it on the pair of them. He picks up the first weapon, then starts setting up a laser. Once it is ready and working, Spencer sets the beam to move across the floor towards the helpless trio, then leaves.)

[Flight deck]

(Ann leaves with a metal container.) 
CROSSLAND: I suppose there's no use my asking where this plane's going to? 
BLADE: You will know soon enough. This is Plane number three to Base. Inform the Director that I have an original for him as ordered. I am delivering him now, and will return immediately to Gatwick Airport.

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

SAMANTHA: Jamie? Are you all right? 
JAMIE: Aye. They've not harmed you, have they? 
SAMANTHA: No, but I can't move. 
JAMIE: Doctor? 
SAMANTHA: Are you all right? 
DOCTOR: What's happening? I can't move. What's that? 
SAMANTHA: I don't know. It's a beam of light. 
JAMIE: Aye. Doctor, it's moving towards us. 
(The laser beam ignites a pile of wood shavings.) 
DOCTOR: That's just a small foretaste of what'll happen to us if we don't move and quickly. 
JAMIE: But I can't move, Doctor. 
SAMANTHA: Neither can I. Oh, wait a minute. I can move one arm. But I can't move away. 
(Samantha can just reach her handbag.)

[Medical centre x-ray room]

(Nurse Pinto is transforming another chameleon, using Jenkins from Immigration as the template.)

[Chameleon Tours hangar]

(Our heroes are starting to get some movement back.) 
SAMANTHA: Oh, Doctor, can't you do anything to stop it? 
DOCTOR: No. Wait. One thing. It's a long chance but it just might work. Have you got a mirror in that bag? 
SAMANTHA: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Let's see. Yes, that'll do. Hand it to me. 
SAMANTHA: I can't. 
DOCTOR: I can't move my hand. Jamie, can you take it? 
SAMANTHA: Have you got it? 
JAMIE: No. Careful. 
SAMANTHA: Take it. 
JAMIE: Got it. 
DOCTOR: Right now, see if you can point it at that laser gun. 
JAMIE: Ay? 
DOCTOR: That thing on the wall. 
JAMIE: I'll try, Doctor. But why? 
DOCTOR: Well, if you can reflect the light back, we've got a chance. 
SAMANTHA: Can't you prop it up on something? 
JAMIE: No, it won't work. I'll have to hold it. 
SAMANTHA: But your hand. 
JAMIE: It's a risk I'll have to take. 
(The beam is nearly on them.) 
DOCTOR: Quick, Jamie, now! 
(Jamie adjusts the mirror, reflecting the beam back to its projector. It explodes.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, well done. 
JAMIE: Why, I can move. 
DOCTOR: I wonder if 
JAMIE: Do you think that's what happened to Ben and Polly, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: No. 
JAMIE: Are you sure? 
DOCTOR: I think they were needed for some purpose. 
JAMIE: And we weren't. 
DOCTOR: We were obviously too dangerous for them. 
SAMANTHA: But to try and do something like this in broad daylight. 
DOCTOR: Yes. It means only one thing, I'm afraid. Their plans are almost complete. We'll have to act fast if we're going to save Polly and Ben. 
SAMANTHA: And Brian. Or have you forgotten about him. 
DOCTOR: No, I've not forgotten him, Sam, but if my guess is right they're all in the same place. 
JAMIE: And where's that? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. Wait. The first aid post. 
JAMIE: Ay? 
DOCTOR: We saw a first aid post on that monitor. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
DOCTOR: We must find it. Well, come on. You're not going to sit there all day, are you? Just a minute. We can't all go down to the Medical Unit. 
SAMANTHA: All right. What can I do? 
DOCTOR: Did you get a good look at the man who tried to kill us? 
SAMANTHA: I'll say. I had me arms round his neck. 
DOCTOR: Go down to the Chameleon Kiosk and see if he comes in or out. 
SAMANTHA: Right. 
DOCTOR: But be careful. Don't let him see you. 
SAMANTHA: Me be careful? You two watch out for yourselves. I'll be okay. 
(Samantha picks up her mirror and leaves.) 
JAMIE: She's got a lot of courage, that wee lass, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes. I just hope she doesn't try to be too adventurous.

[Medical Centre x-ray room]

(The new version of Jenkins is sitting up.) 
PINTO: Who are you? 
JENKINS 2: Steven Christopher Jenkins 
PINTO: Where do you live? 
JENKINS 2: With my parents in Wimbledon. 
PINTO: Employment? 
JENKINS 2: I'm an Immigration officer at Gatwick Airport.

[Medical Centre]

(The Doctor helps a half-conscious Jamie into the room.) 
DOCTOR: We'll have you as right as rain in a minute. Now just get you down here. There we are. Splendid. 
JAMIE: (sotto) How am I doing, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: (sotto) Very well, but don't over do it. Yes, this is the room we saw on the TV monitor. 
(Nurse Pinto enters, leading Jenkins 2 out.) 
PINTO: If the tablets do not help, come and see me again. What's the matter with him? 
DOCTOR: It's a rare tropical disease, Nurse. I'm his doctor. If he if he doesn't rally soon we shall, we shall have to use somnalin. 
PINTO: Somnalin? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, somnalin. I shall have to get him somewhere to lie down. 
(He opens the door to the x-ray room.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, this will do nicely. 
PINTO: I'm afraid you can't go there. 
DOCTOR: Why not? It's just an x-ray room, isn't it? Isn't that a couch behind the screen. 
PINTO: I'm sorry, Doctor. You can't take your patient in there. 
DOCTOR: You refuse to help my patient? 
PINTO: Oh, it's not that. I have someone coming for an x-ray. 
DOCTOR: Oh I see. Well why didn't you tell me in the first place.

[Chameleon Tours cubicle]

(Spencer and Jenkins 2 are watching on the monitor as the Doctor and Jamie leave.) 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Let's get you out of here. 
SPENCER: That Doctor is a menace to our plans. 
JENKINS 2: Then we must kill him. 
SPENCER: I tried. He must have escaped. 
JENKINS 2: They won't escape me. 
SPENCER: No, wait. This time, let them to come to us.

[Air Traffic Control]

JEAN: (on telephone) I've been paging him, Superintendent, but he hasn't responded. Yes, very well sir. I'll keep on trying. Operator. Look, I booked a call through to Athens. Now what's happened? 
(The Doctor and Jamie enter.) 
JEAN: Yes, very well, I'll stay near the phone. 
COMMANDANT: What's all this about? 
JEAN: Oh, Doctor, have you seen Inspector Crossland? 
DOCTOR: Well, no. Why? 
JEAN: Well, Scotland Yard are looking for him and we can't find him anywhere. Also, your Miss Briggs wants to see you. 
DOCTOR: But I told her to. Where is she now? 
JEAN: Well, she said something about going to the Chameleon Kiosk. 
DOCTOR: Go down and join her, Jamie. She's a very strong headed young woman. See she doesn't come to any trouble. 
JAMIE: I'll keep an eye on her, Doctor. 
(Jamie leaves. Jean's telephone rings.) 
DOCTOR: Commandant, did the Inspector say where he was going? 
COMMANDANT: Hmm? Oh, he said he was going to make some enquires about Chameleon Tours. 
DOCTOR: And now he's disappeared? 
COMMANDANT: Aren't you rather jumping to conclusions? 
DOCTOR: I don't think so. My two friends became involved with Chameleon Tours and they've both disappeared. However, you know what I think's happened. 
COMMANDANT: Yes, and you know what I think about your ridiculous theory. People from outer space, indeed. 
(Jean looks shocked.) 
COMMANDANT: Something the matter with you? 
JEAN: Commandant, I've found out what's been happening. 
DOCTOR: Well, that's a step in the right direction. 
JEAN: What I mean is I took the liberty of phoning all the airports that Chameleon Tours fly to. The last on my list was Athens. 
COMMANDANT: But don't you realise the expense of phoning Athens. 
JEAN: Yes, I know, I'm sorry. But what I found out is, they never deliver any passengers. 
COMMANDANT: What do you mean? Never deliver any passengers. 
JEAN: It's absolutely true, sir. They all say the same thing. Dubrovnik, Athens, Rome. They say they pick up young passengers to take them off to other places, but none of them ever arrive anywhere. 
COMMANDANT: Well in that case, they must be flying these young people to some secret airfield. But why? 
DOCTOR: You're still thinking in Earth terms. 
COMMANDANT: And I intend to go on doing so. What was the name of that Chameleon Pilot? 
JEAN: Captain Blade. 
COMMANDANT: And what time is the plane due back? 
JEAN: About half an hour sir. 
COMMANDANT: Right. After the turn-round we'll have it followed this time. 
DOCTOR: Might I have a word with you, my dear? 
COMMANDANT: Get me the RAF Station Manston. 
DOCTOR: I suspect that the Medical Centre is connected with all this. 
JEAN: Medical? Oh come on. 
DOCTOR: Now, please don't get like him. Oh yes, there is definitely a connection. Now, I would like to get in there and have a look round. 
JEAN: But anyone can go in there. 
DOCTOR: But I would like to get that nurse out of the way first. Do you think that you could manage it for me?

[Chameleon Tours kiosk]

(Samantha has just bought a ticket.) 
ANN: You'll find that in order. 
SAMANTHA: Ta. 
JAMIE: He said you'd do something silly. 
SAMANTHA: Oh yeah? What else did he say? 
JAMIE: He said you were headstrong. 
SAMANTHA: Oh great. Look, you can tell the Doctor he's not going to talk me out of this one, and neither are you. I'm going on the next Chameleon flight that leaves in half a hour. Oh look, don't you see it's the only way we can find out anything. Oh, don't worry. I'll come back and tell you all about it. 
JAMIE: Aye, if you do come back. 
SAMANTHA: Oh, it's only going to Rome. 
JAMIE: And what makes you so sure you'll find your brother in Rome? 
SAMANTHA: Oh, I don't know. But that's where he was supposed to be going. At least I'll be doing something. 
JAMIE: Aye, but do you not realise how dangerous it is? 
SAMANTHA: Look, if you're sacred, I'm certainly not. 
JAMIE: I wish the Doctor were here. 
SAMANTHA: Oh. 
JAMIE: Hey, maybe I could go with you. 
SAMANTHA: Hey, now you're talking. Do you think you can you raise the lolly? 
JAMIE: The lolly? 
SAMANTHA: The brass, the money. Look, it'll cost you twenty eight quid. Pounds to you. 
JAMIE: Oh, but that's a fortune. I've never seen that much money in my life. I suppose I couldn't take your place? 
SAMANTHA: No! 
(Jamie spots the plane ticket in the top of her bag.) 
JAMIE: The Doctor said it was no job for a wee lassie. 
SAMANTHA: A wee lassie? You can tell the Doctor. 
JAMIE: I'll say goodbye. 
(Jamie suddenly grabs Sam and kisses her.) 
SAMANTHA: Hey, kid! 
(As they continue to embrace, Jamie takes her ticket and puts it inside his sweater.) 
SAMANTHA: I can take care of myself, you know. 
JAMIE: I just wanted to make sure.

[Air Traffic Control]

COMMANDANT: (into phone) Hmm. So you can arrange to have it followed? Good. Oh, I'll find out. What time's the next Chameleon flight? 
JEAN: 1530hrs to Rome, sir. 
COMMANDANT: 1530hrs heading south. Right. And I'll let you know when they request permission to start up. Cheerio, old man, and many thanks. Well, that's settled that. The next Chameleon flight will have an RAF fighter on its tail. 
(Jean collapses into a chair, groaning.) 
COMMANDANT: Good grief. Jean. Jean! What's the matter with the girl? Get me the Medical Centre.

[Medical centre]

PINTO: (into phone) Isn't it possible for your assistant to come down here, Commandant? But I'm not supposed to leave here. All right, sir. If you insist. 
(Pinto picks up a medical bag and leaves. The Doctor enters and goes straight to

[Medical centre x-ray room]

(The Doctor examines the alien transference device closely. Then he finds two electrical switches hidden in the couch. He plays with them, not noticing a screen sliding back to reveal the real nurse Pinto. She is wearing a white armband. The Doctor continues fiddling and the screen closes again. Now he checks a large cupboard and picks the lock with a screwdriver. Jenkins 2 has entered the medical centre and is watching through the doorway. He has a ray gun at the ready. The cupboard contains the supply of black and white armbands. The Doctor takes one of each and locks it up again before going to leave. A passenger enters the main room and Jenkins 2 hides his weapon. The Doctor comes out of the x-ray room.) 
DOCTOR: I'm just going off duty, but this gentleman will be pleased to attend to you. 
(The Doctor leaves, quickly.)

[Air Traffic Control]

PINTO: How do you feel? 
JEAN: Not too good. 
COMMANDANT: I can't understand it. She's never done this on me before. 
(The Doctor enters.) 
JEAN: Thank you, Nurse. I feel much better now. 
COMMANDANT: Well, there couldn't be much wrong then. 
PINTO: Have you had any lunch? 
JEAN: No, I've been so busy today, I haven't even had any breakfast. 
PINTO: Then no wonder you didn't feel well. Really, Commandant. You must see that your staff have time for regular meals. 
COMMANDANT: I've never stopped her having her lunch. 
PINTO: I'm sure, Commandant. But it has been known to happen. 
(Pinto leaves.) 
COMMANDANT: Now look here, Jean. 
DOCTOR: Very well done. 
JEAN: Did I give you enough time? 
DOCTOR: Ample time. 
COMMANDANT: What is all this? You weren't ill at all, were you? 
DOCTOR: It's all right, Commandant. She was acting on my instructions. 
COMMANDANT: On your instructions? 
DOCTOR: Yes. What do you think of these? 
COMMANDANT: Now, what are these? 
DOCTOR: I think there's somebody here who can tell us. 
(The Doctor holds the two armbands and looks around for a certain ATC.) 
DOCTOR: Excuse me. Where's the chap who usually sits there? 
COMMANDANT: Well, he's probably off duty. In that case, he'll be back on shift in a couple of hours. 
DOCTOR: I see. Oh well, these'll have to wait.

[Chameleon Tours kiosk]

(Ann is checking passenger tickets.) 
TANNOY: Chameleon Youth Tours announce the departure of their flight number 419 to Rome. Will all passengers please assemble in the departure lounge. 
ANN: Don't forget your postcards. Give them back to me and we'll post them for you in Rome. Have you found your ticket yet? 
SAMANTHA: I don't know. I seem to have lost it somewhere. But you remember me, don't you? I bought the ticket off you. 
ANN: There are so many people. What was the name?

[Chameleon Tours cubicle]

SAMANTHA [on monitor]: Samantha Briggs. Oh, it had S Briggs on the ticket. 
ANN [on monitor]: S Briggs has already checked in. 
SAMANTHA [on monitor]: Oh no. Well, who the heck? Look, can you remember what she looked like? 
ANN [on monitor]: She? I seem to remember a boy with that ticket. 
SAMANTHA [on monitor]: Jamie. He's pinched it. Look, you have to stop him. 
ANN [on monitor]: I can't hold up the flight. 
SAMANTHA [on monitor]: But look. 
ANN [on monitor]: I'm sorry, there's nothing more I can do for you. 
(Spencer phones through to the front desk)

[Chameleon Tours kiosk]

ANN: Hello. Yes, all right. That's very kind of you. You're very fortunate. Your ticket's just been found. 
SAMANTHA: Oh, good. Well who got it? 
ANN: We can't tell you that, I'm afraid, but our manager would like to see you. He's just through there. 
SAMANTHA: Oh right, ta. 
(Samantha goes to the rear cubicle.) 
ANN: Now, who's got their postcards ready?

[Chameleon Tours cubicle]

SAMANTHA: Er, you wanted to see me? 
SPENCER: Yes, indeed. You won't escape again. 
(Meanwhile, Jamie and the other young people are boarding their plane. What about his lack of passport? Oh well.)

[Air Traffic Control]

HESLINGTON: Chameleon 419. Clearance correct. 
BLADE [OC]: Chameleon 419. Taxi Clearance. 
HESLINGTON: Chameleon 419. Taxi following southern taxiway for departure runway 27. 
BLADE [OC]: Roger. 
COMMANDANT: Well, this time they'll have the RAF on their tail. 
DOCTOR: How high can fighters go these days, Commandant? 
COMMANDANT: Oh, ten miles plus. 
DOCTOR: How futile. 
(Chameleon 419 takes off.) 
JEAN: RAF Manston, sir. 
COMMANDANT: Oh, good. Hello, old boy. The Chameleon Rome flight's just taken off. They're on Amber one, at flight level 210. Right. Good man. 
(A fighter plane takes off from Kent to intercept.)

[Aeroplane]

ANN: You can unfasten your seat belts now. Thank you. 
(Jamie is very pale.) 
ANN: Are you all right? 
JAMIE: Oh aye, I'll be all right. 
ANN: Good. 
(Then Jamie makes a sprint for the rear toilets.)

[Air Traffic Control]

COMMANDANT: That's the fifty mile mark they're passing now. 
DOCTOR: Normally you don't plot them at this range? 
COMMANDANT: No, there's too much traffic to control. Once they're up and away on their air corridor, we're finished with them. 
PILOT [OC]: Hello, Gatwick Airport. This is RAF 241. How do you read me?

[RAF fighter]

HESLINGTON [OC]: Gatwick Airport to RAF 241. We read you loud and clear. 
PILOT: Have the Chameleon aircraft in sight. Am following at ten thousand feet, heading due south.

[Air Traffic Control]

COMMANDANT: That's him, right on the tail. So far, so good.

[Flight deck]

ANN: All set. 
BLADE: Something's following us. 
ANN: Another airliner going the same way? 
BLADE: No, it's too small. It's a fighter. Give me a radar reading. 
ANN: Two three decimal seven nine. 
(Blade uses a targeting device then presses a button.)

[RAF fighter]

(A beam of light hits the pilot. He screams.)

[Air Traffic Control]

COMMANDANT: Heslington, that fighter's off course. 
HESLINGTON: Gatwick to RAF 241. Do you read me? 
DOCTOR: That plane isn't just off course. Something's happened to it. 
COMMANDANT: You're right. It's out of control. 
HESLINGTON: Gatwick to RAF 241. Do you read me? 
DOCTOR: I don't think you'll get a reply. 
COMMANDANT: It's fading, dropping out of our radar. Jean, get me RAF Manston. That plane's crashed. 
HESLINGTON: Look at the Chameleon plane. There's something wrong with that too. 
COMMANDANT: Hmmm? 
DOCTOR: It's standing still! 
COMMANDANT: Impossible. 
HESLINGTON: No, sir, the blip's stationary. 
COMMANDANT: That can only mean one thing. It's crashing, too.

[Aeroplane]

(Actually it isn't. It is hovering, folding it's wings back into the fuselage. The passenger cabin is empty. Ann picks up a small object from each seat and puts them into their own compartment in her metal container.) 
BLADE [OC]: Report to the flight deck immediately.

[Flight deck]

BLADE: How many people require passports in order to leave the airport on the next flight. 
ANN: Twenty five. 
BLADE: You missed this one here. 
ANN: I'm sorry. 
BLADE: Carry on. 
(Ann returns to the main compartment, but has lost her place. Did she pick something up from Jamie's seat or not? As it is empty she assumes she must have, and moves on.)

[Air Traffic Control]

JEAN: Negative report from Air Sea Rescue, sir. 
COMMANDANT: But with two aircraft ditching there must be some signs of wreckage. 
DOCTOR: Why do you think the Chameleon plane crashed into the sea? 
COMMANDANT: Because it disappeared off our radar screen. 
DOCTOR: But it stood still first. 
COMMANDANT: Because it must have collided with the RAF plane and dropped like a stone. 
DOCTOR: Why do you think that? 
COMMANDANT: You see, when a plane on that radar appears to stand still, it is in point of fact dropping straight down. 
DOCTOR: What about straight up? 
COMMANDANT: Oh, my dear Doctor. To get above our radar umbrella like that it'd have to climb vertically until it was a hundred miles high. The darned thing would be in outer space. 
DOCTOR: Exactly. 
(Flight 419 is now a rocket which has left Earth's atmosphere and entered the blackness of space to rendezvous with a huge conical satellite in geostationary orbit, which no one, including NASA, Jodrell Bank and NORAD, has noticed up there. Space doors open and the former aeroplane enters.)

Episode Five

[Aeroplane]

(Ann comes out from the flight deck carrying the metal container. Blade is with her.) 
ANN: That plane they sent to follow us, should we have destroyed it? 
BLADE: We could eliminate a whole squadron of their toy planes and they'd never get on to us. Their minds can't cope with an operation like this. Remember the teaching of our Director. The intelligence of Earth people is comparable only to that of animals on our planet. 
(Blade and Ann disembark. Jamie comes out of the galley and starts to follow them, but hides again when two blank Chameleons come on board and start removing the passenger's hand luggage. Finally his chance comes, and he leaves the plane.)

[Stock room]

(Ann carefully unloads the contents of the container into a cabinet drawer and leaves. Jamie watches her walk down the corridor. He intends to follow, but there are other people around so he goes into the stock room instead. The room is completely lined with tall metal cabinets full of small specimen drawers, each containing six miniaturised humans.) 
ANN: I thought I'd missed one of you. I wondered what happened to you. 
JAMIE: What have you done to them? 
ANN: Close that drawer. 
(Two blank Chameleons enter and seize Jamie.) 
JAMIE: No. No. Don't. Leave me. No, leave me!

[Air Traffic Control]

(Sad telephone calls are being received.) 
JEAN: Right, thank you. Air Sea Rescue say they're still searching but there's no trace yet. 
COMMANDANT: Commandant. I see. Did the pilot managed to bail out? I'm sorry. They've found the remains of that RAF plane. The pilot had been electrocuted. 
DOCTOR: Do you still think these people are from Earth? 
COMMANDANT: I don't know, Doctor. I just don't know what to think. If only there was one solid piece of evidence. 
DOCTOR: I think it's just come in. Do you mind if I question him? I think I know how to make him talk. 
(The Doctor goes over to Meadows 2, who has just come in, and shows him the white armband.) 
DOCTOR: You know what this is, don't you? 
MEADOWS 2: I don't know what you're talking about. 
DOCTOR: Oh I think you do. Roll up your sleeve. 
MEADOWS 2: Do I have to take orders from him, sir? 
COMMANDANT: I think perhaps you should explain, Doctor. After all, this man is working for me. 
DOCTOR: You only think he's working for you. Commandant, your personnel are being systematically replaced, and this is how they are doing it. This is not Meadows, it only looks like Meadows. He's wearing one of these things on his arm. 
COMMANDANT: Very well, do as he asks. 
MEADOWS 2: But sir, this is ridiculous. 
COMMANDANT: We all have to help in this, Meadows. Roll up your sleeve. 
(Meadows 2 makes a dash for the door.) 
DOCTOR: Stop him! 
(Jean pushes a chair in Meadow 2's path and he falls over it. Two other ATC restrain him.) 
COMMANDANT: Now get him in this chair. Jean, send for the police. All right, Doctor, go ahead. 
DOCTOR: Roll up his left sleeve. 
(The black armband is revealed.) 
DOCTOR: There we are. Now then. What happens if I were to turn one of these? 
MEADOWS 2: Don't touch it! 
DOCTOR: Ah, I see. Right. Now then, you are going to answer all my questions, and in return, I promise no harm will come to you. Do you understand? 
MEADOWS 2: All right. 
DOCTOR: Where are your planes taking all their passengers? 
MEADOWS 2: There's a satellite about a hundred and fifty miles up. 
DOCTOR: Why are you abducting all these young people? 
MEADOWS 2: We had a catastrophe on our planet. A gigantic explosion. As you've seen, we have lost our identities. My people are dying out. 
COMMANDANT: But what use would our people be to you? 
MEADOWS 2: Our scientists devised a process so that we could take on the physical characteristics of another being. 
DOCTOR: This is part of the process? 
MEADOWS 2: Yes, that's why you mustn't touch it. 
DOCTOR: How many of these young people do you hope to abduct? 
MEADOWS 2: This time, fifty thousand. 
COMMANDANT: Fifty thousand! 
DOCTOR: How large is this satellite? 
MEADOWS 2: On the journey in our planes, the passengers are miniaturised. 
DOCTOR: I see. How many of your people are working here at Gatwick Airport? 
MEADOWS 2: I don't know. That's the truth, I tell you. I don't know. 
DOCTOR: Very well. What happens to the people whose identity has been taken over, the originals? 
MEADOWS 2: They're somewhere in the airport. I don't know exactly where. 
COMMANDANT: I'll have the whole place torn to pieces to find them. 
MEADOWS 2: No, you mustn't find them. 
DOCTOR: Why not? 
MEADOWS: You, you mustn't, that's all. 
DOCTOR: Because if we do find them, we'll find one of these on their arms, eh? And if we remove it, something terrible will happen to you? 
MEADOWS 2: Yes. 
DOCTOR: What if you have to change back? 
MEADOWS 2: Well, that can be done, but with the machine. 
DOCTOR: The machine in the Medical Centre? 
MEADOWS 2: Yes. None of us know where our own originals are, except that Nurse. 
DOCTOR: Nurse? What about her? 
MEADOWS 2: Oh she was cunning. She's got her own original with her. 
DOCTOR: Where is it? 
MEADOWS 2: I don't know. 
DOCTOR: I think you do know. Now, are you going to tell me? 
MEADOWS 2: It's in the Medical Centre. 
DOCTOR: Right, you're going to show me where it is. 
MEADOWS 2: I daren't. She'll have me destroyed. 
DOCTOR: Are you going to co-operate or are you not? 
(Two policemen enter.) 
MEADOWS 2: All right. It won't make any difference. You'll never see those fifty thousand young people again. 
DOCTOR: I think I'd better take him down there. The Medical Centre.

[Medical centre]

(Samantha is gagged and strapped to the couch in the x-ray room. Pinto goes into the main area and opens a first aid box on the wall. She activates the monitor at the back of the box.) 
SPENCER [on monitor]: What is it? 
PINTO: This girl. What do we do with her? 
SPENCER [on monitor]: We need to use her as an original. That way we can get one of our people close to the man who is menacing us. He will then be killed. 
PINTO: But surely Captain Blade isn't bringing any more of our people to Earth? 
(The monitor goes blank as the Doctor enters.) 
PINTO: Can I help you? 
DOCTOR: Bring him in. 
(The policemen escort Meadows 2 into the room.) 
PINTO: I'm afraid I don't understand. 
DOCTOR: I think you two have something in common. 
PINTO: Is this man ill, officer? 
DOCTOR: Roll up your sleeves. 
PINTO: What are you talking about? 
DOCTOR: Officer! 
PINTO: Please, take your hands off me. 
DOCTOR: Certainly. 
(He pulls up her left sleeve.) I've seen all I want to see. I'll have that, if you don't mind. 
(He takes the pen weapon from her tunic.) 
DOCTOR: Now then, where is her original? 
MEADOWS 2: It's in there. 
PINTO: You can't go in there! 
DOCTOR: Would you rather be destroyed? Keep an eye on her, officer. Bring him along.

[Medical centre x-ray room]

DOCTOR: Sam! Sam, are you all right? 
(The Doctor frees Samantha.) 
DOCTOR: Are you all right, Sam? 
SAMANTHA: Yeah. Oh, I thought I was done for there. Pins and needles. 
DOCTOR: You're lucky it was no worse. 
(He checks her arm is sheath-free.) 
SAMANTHA: What are you doing? 
DOCTOR: Just checking up. Now then, where is the Nurse's original? 
MEADOWS 2: It's in a panel in the wall somewhere. The control's in the couch there. 
DOCTOR: All right, Officer. 
(The policeman releases Meadows 2 to operate the controls. The panel slides back to reveal the real Nurse, wearing the white armband.) 
SAMANTHA: Flipping heck. But she's in there! 
(In the main room, Pinto 2 has been washing her hands. There is a ray gun hidden in one of the towels and she uses it on the policeman, who screams and dies. Then she goes into the x-ray room and aims it at Meadows 2.) 
PINTO: You traitor! 
SAMANTHA: Look out! 
(Before she can fire, Meadows leaps towards the real Nurse and touches her armband. Pinto 2 dissolves into a shapeless blob.) 
DOCTOR: It's all right, Sam. It's all right. 
SAMANTHA: She vanished! 
MEADOWS 2: Doctor. 
(The real nurse is waking up.) 
DOCTOR: Put her on here. 
(Meadows helps her onto a couch.) 
MEADOWS 2: There we are. 
DOCTOR: Will there be any permanent damage? 
MEADOWS 2: No. You can take that off now. 
(He takes off the nurse's armband.) 
DOCTOR: It's all right. You'll be quite all right in a few minutes. There. 
(The Doctor sees a pile of files on a table.) 
SAMANTHA: Doctor, what's happened to Jamie? 
DOCTOR: What on Earth are these doing here? 
SAMANTHA: Doctor, Jamie wasn't anywhere near the kiosk the last time. Look, you're not listening! I think they've got Jamie! 
DOCTOR: Jamie! Where? 
SAMANTHA: Well, you should know. You got him to pinch me ticket. 
DOCTOR: Pinch your ticket? 
SAMANTHA: To stop me from going to Rome. 
DOCTOR: Oh. You mean Jamie has 
SAMANTHA: Has gone in my place. 
DOCTOR: First Polly and Ben, now Jamie. We've no time to lose.

[Stock room]

(Tied to a chair, Jamie is struggling to get free when the door opens.) 
JAMIE: Inspector! 
CROSSLAND: Let's see if I can get you out of there. How did you get here? 
(Crossland unties Jamie. He seems to have lost his accent somewhere.) 
JAMIE: I came on the plane, stole someone's ticket. 
CROSSLAND: You ought to have been miniaturised on the journey. 
JAMIE: Miniaturised? 
CROSSLAND: Reduced in size, like all the youngsters in these cabinets. Did you not have anything to eat or drink? 
JAMIE: No, I felt too ill. 
CROSSLAND: That explains it. The food is the first part of the process. 
JAMIE: Inspector, what is this place? 
CROSSLAND: A satellite, Jamie. A flying ship in space. These people are from another planet. It seems the Doctor was right after all. Does anyone down there believe him yet? 
JAMIE: Oh, I'm not sure. I don't think so. 
CROSSLAND: I suppose it is too much for them to believe. But surely the Doctor's convinced them that something is going on? 
JAMIE: Aye, I think maybe the Commandant. 
CROSSLAND: Yes, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Inspector, have you escaped or something? 
CROSSLAND: No-one escapes from here. 
JAMIE: But the plane that comes here, well, it must go back to Earth. We could get on it. 
CROSSLAND: The last plane to Earth is leaving now. They've just gone back to pick up their own people. 
JAMIE: Surely the Doctor'll think of some way of rescuing us? 
CROSSLAND: Not this time, Jamie. This time he's up against a mind superior even to his. The mind of the Director. 
JAMIE: You mean someone clever than the Doctor? 
CROSSLAND: The man in charge of this whole mission. 
JAMIE: You seem to know a lot about it, Inspector. 
CROSSLAND: Of course I do, Jamie. I am the Director. 
(The space doors open and the rocket shaped aeroplane comes out, to descend to Earth.)

[Air Traffic Control]

COMMANDANT: And his is the bearing where the Chameleon plane vanished. I want to know if it reappears there. They've a flight due any minute. 
HESLINGTON: Very good, sir. 
COMMANDANT: Now then, Doctor. What's all this about personnel files? 
DOCTOR: Over here. I'll show you. I found these in the Medical Centre. Records of twenty five people who work here. Each one of these has been taken over by Chameleons. 
COMMANDANT: Right. I'll have them all under arrest within fifteen minutes. Airport Police please. Now, look at this. 
DOCTOR: What is it? 
JEAN: Chameleon Air Schedules. 
COMMANDANT: You see here? Their last flight of the season goes in an hour. Superintendent Reynolds please. 
DOCTOR: The last flight? Well that's exactly why they mustn't be arrested. 
COMMANDANT: Superintendent? Commandant here. 
DOCTOR: Will you please listen to me! 
COMMANDANT: Will you hold on a moment, please? 
DOCTOR: These people must not be arrested. 
COMMANDANT: Why not? 
DOCTOR: Somewhere in outer space, there are fifty thousand young people, three of my friends amongst them, and somehow we've got to bring them back. I want to get on this last flight, which means the Chameleons must think that everything is going according to plan. 
HESLINGTON: Commandant? 
COMMANDANT: Reynolds, I'll call you back. Now what is it? 
HESLINGTON: This blip. It's just appeared out of nowhere and it's coming this way. 
COMMANDANT: Right, well keep tracking them. It maybe the Chameleon plane returning. Now look here, Doctor. All very well talking about getting on that plane, but how? 
DOCTOR: At the moment, you look like a man called Meadows. Could you shed that identity and become somebody else? 
MEADOWS: Yes. Yes, some of our people have been processed twice. 
DOCTOR: Good. Then in that case I shall pretend I am a Chameleon, and get on board that way. 
COMMANDANT: But even if you get on that plane, what do you hope to do? 
DOCTOR: I don't know till I get to the satellite, and then I will have one card to play, and that's up to you Commandant. 
COMMANDANT: What's that? 
DOCTOR: The people the Chameleons have taken over, the originals, are hidden somewhere here in Gatwick Airport. You have got to find them. 
COMMANDANT: Of course, and get those fearful things off their arms. 
DOCTOR: No, no, no! Find them, by all means, but don't tamper with those arm sheaths. Otherwise we lose our one threat. The one thing I may be able to bargain with. 
COMMANDANT: Yes, I see that. But I still don't see how you're going to get on that plane, let alone convince them that you're one of their people. 
DOCTOR: That will depend entirely on Nurse Pinto. 
COMMANDANT: Jean, get onto Superintendent Reynolds.

[Medical centre]

DOCTOR: Now, is everything clear? You're sure you understand what I am asking you to do? 
PINTO: Yes, of course, but we've got to think of those young people. 
(Blade enters with a briefcase.) 
BLADE: How very convenient. Lock the door. 
PINTO: No, don't shoot! This is Meadows. He had to be re-processed. 
BLADE: Why? 
DOCTOR: The Doctor became too suspicious of me as Meadows. I was able to kidnap him. The rest is as you can see. 
BLADE: A pity. It was useful having someone in Air Traffic Control. But then of course we have possession of the Doctor's brain. 
DOCTOR: You think that will be useful? 
BLADE: Undoubtedly. 
DOCTOR: That means that you'll be taking us up to the satellite? 
BLADE: I am taking everybody back to the satellite on the next plane. It's the last flight. Surely you haven't forgotten that? 
DOCTOR: The re-processing. It's difficult to remember details. 
BLADE: Yes, of course, I understand. What have you done with his original? 
DOCTOR: In a safe place. 
BLADE: Well it should be with the others. 
DOCTOR: Tell me where that is and I'll have it transferred. 
BLADE: There's no time for that now. Jenkins will see you through Immigration. We leave in fifteen minutes. 
(Blade leaves.) 
PINTO: Do you think we convinced him? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. However, we've got aboard that plane. Come on, don't let's be late.

[Air Traffic Control]

JEAN: Right. Thank you. That was the police, sir. They say the passengers are now boarding the Chameleon plane. 
COMMANDANT: Did they see if the Doctor had got on board? 
JEAN: Yes. He was with Nurse Pinto. All the passengers are adults and most of them have been identified as airport personnel. 
HESLINGTON: Commandant. Chameleon plane's requesting clearance for start up. 
COMMANDANT: All right, Heslington, normal procedure. Give them clearance. 
HESLINGTON: Chameleon 345, stand by for start temperature 
(And the plane takes off. A little later.) 
COMMANDANT: Yes. Now it's stationary. It must be ascending vertically. 
HESLINGTON: The blip's getting fainter, sir. That means he's rising above our radar umbrella. 
COMMANDANT: (into phone) Ah Superintendent, the very man. 
HESLINGTON: Blip's just gone, sir. 
COMMANDANT: Now look, Reynolds. We've got to get every man of your force on that search. There isn't a moment to lose. Time's running out on us.

[Medical centre]

(Sam and Jean are searching for clues, Sam in the kiosk and Jean in the Medical Centre.) 
SAMANTHA: Any luck? 
JEAN: No. Look at that. Wish my files were as neat as that. How about you. What about the kiosk? 
SAMANTHA: Not much. Just a few papers. 
JEAN: Hmm. Oh, we'd better get back to Air Traffic Control then.

[Air Traffic Control]

COMMANDANT: Well? 
JEAN: Just a few papers, sir. 
COMMANDANT: Well, there might be a clue there. 
JEAN: Commandant, surely they'd put them somewhere? I mean, well, somewhere we'd never think of. 
COMMANDANT: We've got to think of it, Jean, wherever it is. The Doctor's relying on us. Thousands of lives are depending on us finding those originals, and quickly.

[Aeroplane]

PINTO: How much longer, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. I should think we're almost there. Don't worry. 
(We see the aeroplane turn into a rocket and go through the satellite's space doors.) 
BLADE: One moment. Owing to the complete success of our operation, living space on our satellite has had to be used for our cargo. Therefore, quarters will be re-allocated. Report to the accommodation centre for instructions. 
PINTO: Do you think he's suspects? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. Let's follow the others.

[Transference room]

(The Director is adjusting the armband controls of a new duplicate.) 
DIRECTOR: What is your name? Try again, What is your name? 
JAMIE 2: Jamie. 
(He has no trace of an accent.) 
DIRECTOR: Where do you come from? 
JAMIE 2: From Earth, a place called Scotland. 
DIRECTOR: Excellent. 
(Blade enters.) 
BLADE: Director. 
DIRECTOR: What is it? 
BLADE: We have found two impostors. The Doctor and Nurse Pinto. I want permission to have them destroyed. 
DIRECTOR: One moment. What do you know about the Doctor? 
JAMIE 2: He is not of this Earth or of this century. He has travelled through time and space. His knowledge is even greater than ours. 
BLADE: Director, this man is a danger to us. He should be destroyed. 
DIRECTOR: And I say he must live, but as one of us. 
BLADE: You will regret it. 
DIRECTOR: You have your orders, Captain Blade.

[Satellite corridor]

PINTO: What do we do now? 
DOCTOR: We slip away and see if we can find these young people. Come on. Ah, Captain Blade, we're carrying out your instructions. We're looking for the accommodation centre. 
BLADE: My instructions don't apply to you. You two won't be needing living space. 
(The Doctor and Nurse turn to run, but are surrounded by blank Chameleons.)

Episode Six

[Satellite corridor]

DOCTOR: Captain Blade, what is this? I don't understand. We're here to stay, aren't we? 
BLADE: Oh yes, you're here to stay, but not in your present state. 
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry. I simply don't understand what you mean. 
BLADE: I checked with the Medical Centre. You're both human. We want you intact. That's why I allowed you to come here. I want your brain. 
(They are marched away.)

[Air Traffic Control]

MEADOWS 2: I've told you, I don't know where they are. You're wasting your time with me. 
REYNOLDS: I think he's telling the truth. 
COMMANDANT: I'm afraid he is. Get him out of here. They must be here somewhere. 
REYNOLDS: We have completely searched this area. I've now got fifty men going through this part and the Metropolitan Police are sending help. But time is running short. I have to cover the entire airfield. I need volunteers now. 
COMMANDANT: Get me the public address room. Heslington, divert all in-bound aircraft. Public Address Room, this is the Commandant. Switch me through to the PA system and stop all other announcements until further instructions. This is the Airport Commandant speaking.

[Concourse]

COMMANDANT [OC]: Please pay attention. I want all available Airport personnel to assist in a special duty. Will they please report to the Airport Police, who will issue instructions. I would like to assure passengers that there's no cause for alarm, and to apologise for the temporary suspension of all outward flights. 
(The police are joined by office workers, flight attendants and other ancillary staff from the airport in the search for their colleagues.)

[Director's office]

(The Doctor and Nurse are marched into Crossland 2's office, followed by Blade, Chambers and the Chameleons.) 
DOCTOR: Oh. 
DIRECTOR: What did you hope to achieve here? 
DOCTOR: A chance to plead with you for the lives of fifty thousand young people. 
DIRECTOR: They're only human beings. 
DOCTOR: And what are you? 
DIRECTOR: We are the most intelligent race in the universe. 
JAMIE 2: Director? 
DIRECTOR: Yes? 
JAMIE 2: Freiburg flight has just taken off. 
DOCTOR: Why, Jamie! 
JAMIE 2: You wish to speak to me? 
DOCTOR: Oh no, of course, it's, it's not Jamie. You're a Chameleon. Well, I don't think you've done a very good job on him. 
DIRECTOR: Why not? 
DOCTOR: Well you've lost his Scots accent in the process. Oh, I much preferred the original. 
DIRECTOR: If you're looking for your friend's original, Doctor, you won't find it in here. 
DOCTOR: Really? 
DIRECTOR: No, it's (pause) in a safe place. Not far from here. What are we waiting for? 
JAMIE 2: Dubrovnik and Athens. They're waiting to collect our personnel. 
DIRECTOR: We're well ahead of schedule. We can wait. Proceed with the processing. By the way, Captain Blade, congratulations on bringing this man here. I personally will decide which of our people is to have his identity. 
DOCTOR: It'll be one of your friends, I've no doubt. It's understandable. The special people up here feel more secure if their originals are actually in the satellite. 
DIRECTOR: Be quiet. 
DOCTOR: The Director has nothing to worry about because his original, Detective Inspector Crossland is actually on board. But (to Blade) where's your original? (to Spencer) And where's yours? 
DIRECTOR: That's enough! Their originals are perfectly safe, hidden on Gatwick Airport where they will never be found. 
(The Director leaves. Back at Gatwick, Meadows 2 breaks away from his police escort and makes a run for it.) 
BLADE: What did you mean about our originals? 
DOCTOR: Well, as I see it, there are two categories. People like your Director and that man over there whose originals are safe on board here. And then there are people like you two, whose originals have been left behind at Gatwick airport. If they're tampered with, you're finished. 
BLADE: He's lying. Come on, let's get him into the machine before the Director returns. 
DOCTOR: Yes, you'd better process me quickly, because any minute now you'll cease to exist. You're first on the list. 
BLADE: What list? 
DOCTOR: Oh, surely you understand? We've found all of the originals. The Commandant at the Airport is going to deprocess them one by one, starting with you, unless I stop him. 
SPENCER: He's bluffing. 
BLADE: Wait! Where did you find the originals? 
DOCTOR: Ah, that I can't tell you. But they'd been searching for some time and just as I was about to board the aircraft I got a signal which meant that they'd been successful. Otherwise I wouldn't have come. Well, if you don't believe me, check with Gatwick Airport. I imagine you know its radio frequency? 
(Blade goes over to Jamie 2.) 
BLADE: Contact Gatwick Air Control.

[Air Traffic Control]

REYNOLDS: I've got two dozen men moving down here looking for any signs of the soil having been disturbed. There are twenty men here, with fifty volunteers going through these hangars. 
HESLINGTON: Commandant. 
COMMANDANT: Yes. 
HESLINGTON: Someone's crashing our frequency. 
COMMANDANT: Who is it? 
HESLINGTON: I don't know, sir. It's an unidentified station asking for you. 
JAMIE 2 [OC]: This is Chameleon Headquarters calling Gatwick Airport. How do you read me? 
COMMANDANT: This is Gatwick Airport, Commandant speaking. We are reading you loud and clear. 
JAMIE 2 [OC]: We understand you have found some property in which we have an interest. Will you confirm? 
COMMANDANT: Yes, we have that property. 
JAMIE 2 [OC]: State where you found it. 
COMMANDANT: Does that matter. The important thing is we have found it, and can now destroy you. 
JAMIE 2 [OC]: Please stay by your receiver. 
COMMANDANT: The Doctor must be trying some sort of bluff. 
REYNOLDS: And we're not being much help to him.

{Chameleon Tours kiosk]

(Sam is looking for a paper she found last time.) 
JEAN: Where do you think you left them? 
SAMANTHA: I don't know, I left them in here somewhere. Anyway, none of that Chameleon lot could have nicked them 'cos they've all gone. 
JEAN: Here, look. 
SAMANTHA: Yeah. You see it suddenly dawned on me, what would they be doing with so many coaches? 
JEAN: Oh, why didn't that occur to me? 
SAMANTHA: Oh, you haven't got all the brains in London you know. Twenty five. There you are. Twenty five car numbers, twenty five people.

[Air Traffic Control]

JAMIE 2 [OC]: This is Chameleon Headquarters. Explain your reluctance to state where you found the property. 
COMMANDANT: It is not a question of reluctance. 
REYNOLDS: Say the police haven't told you yet. 
COMMANDANT: The property is in the hands of the police, who have not yet informed me where the hiding place was. 
JAMIE 2 [OC]: Message understood. Please stay by your receiver. 
REYNOLDS: I'll get that. Air Traffic Control. Hold on a minute. It's the girl and your assistant. They think they've got a clue. 
COMMANDANT: Right, I'll try and stall them. 
JAMIE 2 [OC]: Chameleon Headquarters to Gatwick Airport. We are closing down now. 
COMMANDANT: Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Headquarters, are you receiving me?

[Director's office]

COMMANDANT [OC]: Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Headquarters, are you receiving me? Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Headquarters, are you receiving me? 
DIRECTOR: Turn it off. Put that gun away. 
BLADE: He said he'd found our originals. 
DIRECTOR: And had he? 
BLADE: No, he was bluffing. 
DIRECTOR: Proceed with the processing. In future, take your orders only from me. 
DOCTOR: You're going to get a surprise when twenty five of your people disintegrate. 
DIRECTOR: What a pity you won't be able to see it. The Nurse. 
(The Doctor is trying to jam his screwdriver into the processing machine behind his back.) 
DOCTOR: Now then, now what is it you want me to do? 
BLADE: Sit down. 
DOCTOR: Tell me, what happens if you disintegrate in the middle of my being processed? I mean, will that do me any harm, being suspended between one thing and another, so to speak? 
BLADE: Sit down! 
(The machine explodes.) 
DOCTOR: Oh dear. 
DIRECTOR: You should have been watching him. Send for a new unit. You haven't averted your fate, only postponed it.

[Car park]

(Sam and Jean are checking the parked cars, looking for the registration plates on the list they found.)

[Director's office]

DIRECTOR: At last. Now, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: You're quite sure it's safe now? 
(The Doctor sits and has a headset put on him.)

[Car park]

((Meadows 2 is watching Jean and Sam do their search. Then he pounces on Sam. Jean runs to help. There's a struggle, but one alien is no match for a Liver girl and a secretary. Then Sam spots Jenkins inside a car. The police arrive and the rest of the missing people are found.)

[Director's office]

DIRECTOR: Is everything ready now? 
BLADE: Just one moment, sir. 
JAMIE 2: Director. Gatwick Control calling us again. 
DIRECTOR: Ignore them. 
JAMIE 2: They claim they have found the originals. 
DIRECTOR: They're bluffing again, I said ignore them. 
(The Doctor and a Chameleon are now both wired up to the machine.)

[Air Traffic Control]

HESLINGTON: Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Head Quarters. Do you read me? It's no good sir. 
COMMANDANT: Very well. We'll have to give them a demonstration. Right, Super. 
REYNOLDS: Sergeant Erskine?

[Car park]

(The recovered bodies have been laid out. Reynolds talks to his sergeant through a walkie-talkie, who kneels and removes Jenkins' armband.)

[Director's office]

(Jenkins 2 dissolves.) 
BLADE: They have found them! They weren't bluffing. 
DIRECTOR: His equipment could have gone wrong. 
BLADE: All right, what could have gone wrong with it? 
DIRECTOR: That is a question for our scientists. 
DOCTOR: By the time they tell you that there's nothing wrong with it, you'll all have disintegrated, except of course the Director. 
DIRECTOR: Be quiet. This has nothing to do with you. 
DOCTOR: Yes, you're quite right, it only concerns these two. I'll keep my mouth shut. 
BLADE: We'd better contact Gatwick Air Control. 
DIRECTOR: We've finished with Gatwick Airport. 
BLADE: And what if they haven't finished with us? 
DIRECTOR: That would be your own fault, wouldn't it? You told me that all the originals were hidden where they could not possibly be found until the life have been drained from them. Are you now telling me you were careless? 
(Blade aims his ray gun at the Director.) 
BLADE: Contact Gatwick Air Control. 
DIRECTOR: Destroy the transmitter! 
(Spencer raises his weapon.) 
DIRECTOR: All right. 
JAMIE 2: This is Chameleon Headquarters calling Gatwick Airport. How do you read me?

[Air Traffic Control]

COMMANDANT: Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Head Quarters. We are reading you loud and clear. 
JAMIE 2 [OC]: Can you now state where you found the originals? 
COMMANDANT: The originals were discovered in a car park. To prove it, we have already eliminated one of your personnel. A man.

[Director's office]

COMMANDANT [OC]: I now wish to speak to the Doctor. Unless I hear his voice immediately, the next to be eliminated will be Captain Blade. 
BLADE: Release him. I said, release him! 
(The Director unstraps the Doctor.) 
BLADE: Get to that microphone. 
DOCTOR: Release the Nurse first. 
COMMANDANT [OC]: I said I wished to speak to the Doctor, otherwise the next will be Captain Blade. 
BLADE: Doctor, the microphone. 
DOCTOR: Are you quite all right, my dear. 
PINTO: Yes, I think so. 
DOCTOR: Good. Commandant, this is the Doctor speaking. 
COMMANDANT: Ah, what a relief. 
DOCTOR: Stand by while I negotiate. Now then, I will tell you my terms. I will guarantee your continued existence, if you will return to Earth all the young people you abducted. 
DIRECTOR: No use. They've all been miniaturised. 
DOCTOR: Then reverse the process. 
DIRECTOR: I'm afraid that's impossible. The equipment for that is on our home planet. 
BLADE: He's lying. The planes themselves are the miniaturisation chambers and they work both ways. What kind of continued existence would we have, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: In your former state, I'm afraid. Your scientists will have to think of some other way out of your dilemma. 
BLADE: It's better than death. 
SPENCER: We accept. 
BLADE: All right, we accept. 
DIRECTOR: You fools, how can you trust him? 
(The Director starts to leave, and Jamie 2 follows.) 
JAMIE 2: Look out! Ahh! 
(Blade fires, killing them both.) 
DOCTOR: Commandant, are you still there? 
COMMANDANT [OC]: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Negotiations have been successfully concluded as arranged. 
COMMANDANT [OC]: Good. I'll leave the people in the car park as they are until you arrive back. 
DOCTOR: Good. Please stay listening out on this frequency. I am leaving Captain Blade in charge of the radio. 
COMMANDANT [OC]: Can you trust him? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I can now. 
COMMANDANT [OC]: What are you going to do? 
DOCTOR: I'm going to try and find my three friends and the Inspector. You know where they are? 
BLADE: Yes. 
DOCTOR: You will take me to them. I will call you again. 
COMMANDANT [OC]: Roger.

[Air Traffic Control]

COMMANDANT: Well, Heslington, flap over. Let's get back to normal as quick as we can.

[Store room]

BLADE: They're over there. I don't know which one. 
(Jamie is in the first cupboard the Doctor opens. He takes the armband off him.) 
JAMIE: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Jamie! Ha, I'm glad to see you alive. 
JAMIE: How do you mean? 
DOCTOR: I'll explain to you one day. Well, come along out. You look like a soldier in a sentry box standing there. Sit down. 
It's all right, he's a friend. Now sit down while I find the others. Ah! Inspector Crossland. There we are. Now, Ben, Polly and back to Gatwick.

[Director's office]

(Gatwick Airport is back to normal operation.) 
BLADE: Doctor, the first plane is ready for take off. We've got all the processed personnel including your three young friends aboard. 
DOCTOR: Ah, good. 
BLADE: Are you going with us, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm going with Nurse Pinto. Are you going, Inspector? 
CROSSLAND: No, I think I'd better stay here just for a while, to tidy things up. Are you ready, Nurse? 
PINTO: Oh yes, Inspector. 
CROSSLAND: I'll see you to the plane. 
DOCTOR: I'll see you on the plane, Nurse. 
(Crossland and Nurse Pinto leave.) 
BLADE: What will our future be, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: So long as you keep your side of the bargain, you may return to your planet unharmed. Perhaps your scientists will be able to find some way out of their dilemma. I may be able to give them one or two ideas of my own.

[Air Traffic Control]

(The Commandant is on the telephone.) 
COMMANDANT: Yes, yes, I know. All flights were suspended as well as yours. Hello Doctor. All down safely. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes. 
COMMANDANT: Splendid, Splendid. I'll take that Brussels call now. 
DOCTOR: There's just one thing, Commandant. 
COMMANDANT: Yes, yes, right. 
DOCTOR: Our Tardis. Our police box. 
COMMANDANT: Ah Bruxelles. Oui, j'accord. 
DOCTOR: The police box on the runway. 
COMMANDANT: Oh, yes, of course. Jean, see that the Doctor gets his property back, will you? Goodbye, Doctor, and thank you so much. 
DOCTOR: Thank you, Commandant. 
COMMANDANT: Goodbye, Scotty. 
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Samantha. Come along, Jamie. We must find Ben and Polly and get to the Tardis. 
(The Doctor leaves.) 
JAMIE: I'd better say goodbye. 
SAMANTHA: Oh. Well I'll see you around then? 
JAMIE: Around where? 
SAMANTHA: Well, you know, around. Ah, you're not just going off like that? 
JAMIE: Aye, I must go. The Doctor'll be. Well, your brother'll be here any moment. 
SAMANTHA: Yeah. Well, ta-ra then! 
(Samantha suddenly kisses Jamie.) 
JAMIE: Aye, well, er. 
SAMANTHA: Hey, thanks for everything, Jamie. 
JAMIE: I'll say goodbye. 
(Jamie leaves.) 
SAMANTHA: Goodbye, Jamie.

[Gatwick Airport]

(A chauffeur driven car delivers the Doctor and company.) 
DOCTOR: This will do. My thanks to the Commandant. 
POLLY: Thank you every much. Hey, Doctor, where are you going? 
BEN: Hey, come back! 
(The Doctor is marching to a hangar. Jamie catches up with them and they follow.)

[Airport hangar]

POLLY: Doctor. 
BEN: What are you doing? 
DOCTOR: Doing? I'm looking for the Tardis, of course. 
POLLY: Oh, no. Can't we stay in London a bit? 
BEN: Yeah, it's good to feel normal again. 
DOCTOR: Normal? What do you mean, Ben? 
BEN: Well, no monsters, or Cybermen. All this, it's normal. I understand it. 
DOCTOR: Do you? What about Chameleon Tours? 
BEN: Oh yeah, that was different. 
JAMIE: Oh, I'll be glad to get away from here. Can you not land us in a nice civilised place like 1750? 
POLLY: What's so uncivilised about 1966? 
JAMIE: Oh, you can keep it! 
BEN: Did you say 1966? 
POLLY: Yes. 
BEN: What month is it? 
DOCTOR: It's July. July the 20th, to be precise. 
POLLY: What are you getting at? 
BEN: Don't you see, Duchess? July the 20th, 1966 is when it all began! We're back to when it all started. Well, I think. 
POLLY: That means it's as if, it's as if we've never been away. 
DOCTOR: You really want to go, don't you? 
BEN: Well, we won't leave, Doctor, if you really need us. 
POLLY: The thing is, it is our world. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. You're lucky, I never got back to mine. All right, then. Off you go. Now go on, Ben can catch his ship and become an Admiral, and you Polly, you can look after Ben. 
POLLY: I will. You will be safe, won't you? 
JAMIE: I'll look after him. 
BEN: I'm sure you will, mate. Goodbye, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Ben. 
BEN: We might see you sometime. Take care. 
DOCTOR: Well you'd better hurry. The Commandant's car waiting. 
(Ben and Polly leave.) 
JAMIE: I'm sad to see them go. 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. So am I. Well, we've got things to do. 
JAMIE: What things? 
DOCTOR: Well, I didn't tell the others, but we've lost the Tardis. 
JAMIE: We can't have done. 
DOCTOR: It was outside. It's not there now. 
JAMIE: You mean somebody's stolen it? 
DOCTOR: I don't know, but that's what we're going to find out. Come on!

[Gatwick Airport]

(July 20th 1966. A truck comes out of the hangar and drives away with the Tardis is secured to the flatbed at the back. The Doctor and Jamie try to give chase but soon lose sight of it.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
JAMIE: The Tardis!

[Garage]

(Next to the hangar is a garage with fuel pumps outside. A man is working at a bench covered in machine parts. A radio is playing music very loudly.) 
JAMIE: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Excuse me! 
(The man adjusts his hearing aid.) 
HALL: Ay? 
DOCTOR: I wonder if you can help us? 
HALL: My mate likes the wireless turned on at full blast. I have to keep this turned down. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. 
(Hall turns the wireless off.) 
JAMIE: Who's taken the Tardis? 
HALL: The what? 
DOCTOR: He means the police telephone box. 
HALL: He said Tardis or something. 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, Tardis, that's another name for it. 
HALL: Oh, foreign, is he? 
JAMIE: Me, foreign? You're the one that's foreign. I'm Scottish. 
DOCTOR: That's right. Tardis is a is a Gaelic word. Jamie, hush. 
JAMIE: It's getting further away all the time. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. Well, anyway, it's our property and we've come to collect it. 
HALL: Oh, you mean the

[Field outside the airport]

(A man is listening to this in a field next to the airport, through a radio transmitter.) 
HALL [OC]: The police box? 
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes! 
HALL [OC]: Yeah. Well, that's gone.

[Garage]

JAMIE: Oh, we know it's gone. That's the whole point. Its ours and somebody's stolen it. 
HALL: Oh, I don't know about that. I've got a note here somewhere. Yeah, here we are. There. Police Tel Box. Collection 3 o'clock. 
DOCTOR: Let me see this, please. 
HALL: Been signed for. 
DOCTOR: Yes, so I see. J Smith. Doesn't really help us, does it? 
HALL: Yeah, well, I just do what I'm told. You'd better see the airport Commandant or someone. 
DOCTOR: Oh, no. I don't think we'd better do that. Jamie, I think we'd better talk to the police. 
HALL: Of course I, er, I do know the name of the firm what picked it up. 
JAMIE: You do? 
HALL: Yeah, firm name of, er, Leatherman. 
DOCTOR: Thank you very much. You'll be hearing from us. 
JAMIE: Leatherman. Now that's a clue. Just a minute. Now, what street do they? Doctor, wait. 
(The Doctor drags Jamie outside. Once they are out of sight, Hall talks into his hearing aid.) 
HALL: Did you get all that? 
KENNEDY [OC]: Every word. We'd better get going. Get your money back at the warehouse.

[Outside the garage]

(Kennedy watches Jamie and the Doctor through binoculars.) 
JAMIE: We should have followed that clue he gave us. 
DOCTOR: Perhaps. I think we'd better keep an eye on him. 
JAMIE: Why? 
DOCTOR: Well, didn't you notice his overalls? They were much too small for him, and the top sheet of his clip board was different to all the others. And when we mentioned the police he became friendly 
JAMIE: Aye. Hey, may 
(The Doctor pulls Jamie out of sight behind some oil drums as Hall walks past. A few moments later, they follow him.)

[Field outside the airport]

KENNEDY: Kennedy to base. Kennedy to base. Do you read me?

[Antique shop study]

(A man in Victorian clothes answers the radio.) 
KENNEDY [OC]: Kennedy to base. Do you read? 
WATERFIELD: Yes. 
KENNEDY [OC]: The Doctor and his friend are following Bob Hall. 
WATERFIELD: I knew they would suspect him. 
KENNEDY [OC]: (I'll go on to the warehouse. 
WATERFIELD: Very good, Mister Kennedy.

[Airport gates]

(Jamie and the Doctor watch Hall drive off in his car.) 
DOCTOR: That's him. There he goes. 
JAMIE: Oh, no. 
(The Doctor spots a black cab.) 
DOCTOR: For hire. 
JAMIE: Ay? 
DOCTOR: Follow that car.

[Antique shop study]

(There is a knock at the door.) 
WATERFIELD: Yes? 
PERRY OC]: Perry, sir. 
WATERFIELD: Oh, er, one moment, Mister Perry. 
(Waterfield unbolts the door and lets in a slight man in his early twenties.) 
PERRY: It's here. 
WATERFIELD: Good. 
PERRY: Like me to open the shutters, sir? Lovely day outside. 
WATERFIELD: I have a choice between the sun or noise, Mister Perry. I regret shutting out one, but at least I keep out the other. 
PERRY: Yes. (a clock chimes) I say, that's very good. Just come in, eh? Mint condition. Eighteen seventy, is it? 
WATERFIELD: Approximately. 
PERRY: Don't know who your contacts are, sir, but this is marvellous. 
WATERFIELD: Well, Victorian timepieces are my specialty, Mister Perry. 
PERRY: Wish you'd tell me who makes them for you, sir. 
WATERFIELD: But then you would be as wise as I, and that wouldn't do at all, would it? 
PERRY: Whoever makes them, Mister Waterfield, they'd fool an expert. If I didn't know it was impossible, I'd say it was absolutely genuine. 
WATERFIELD: And, er, there was no trouble with the box? 
PERRY: Apparently not. A bit out of our line, isn't it, sir? A battered old police box? 
WATERFIELD: The whims and caprices of our patrons is our line, Mister Perry. 
PERRY: Hmm. Odd though. 
WATERFIELD: Mister Perry, I pay you the sum of 50 guineas per week, do I not? 
PERRY: Pounds, actually, sir. 50 pounds. 
WATERFIELD: Yes. I hope I may be forgiven if I believe that entitles me to demanding less curiosity of you. 
PERRY: Sorry, sir. 
WATERFIELD: It is, I think you will agree, a princely salary. 
PERRY: No complaints on that score. As long as I'm not asked to do anything dicey. 
WATERFIELD: Dicey? 
PERRY: Crooked. Illegal. 
WATERFIELD: Your candour is refreshing, Mister Perry, even if your judgement of character is somewhat questionable. 
PERRY: I didn't mean that 
WATERFIELD: I know perfectly well what you meant. You may rest assured, I shall not ask you to do anything dicey. 
PERRY: No, sir. 
WATERFIELD: I think you are wanted in the shop, Mister Perry. 
PERRY: And the telephone box, sir. What do we do with it? 
WATERFIELD: Do? We do nothing. 
PERRY: Oh, right. 
(Perry leaves.) 
WATERFIELD: Nothing except wait.

[Lane]

(Hall's car is parked in a narrow lane alongside some railway arches with lock up garages.) 
DOCTOR: This is his car. He must be around here somewhere. 
(There is an old abandoned warehouse at the end of the lane.)

[Warehouse]

KENNEDY: You sure you weren't followed? 
HALL: No, course I wasn't. Hey, you haven't told me what this little caper's about yet, Kennedy. 
KENNEDY: Counted the money yet then, have you? 
HALL: No, not yet. 
KENNEDY: Or do you think I made a mistake giving you two fifty instead of seventy five? We thought you might like a little extra. 
HALL: What for? 
KENNEDY: You know those two at the hangar? 
HALL: Yeah? 
KENNEDY: They're outside. You weren't followed. We'll be ready for them, won't we? That's what the extra's for. 
HALL: Now listen. 
KENNEDY: You on one side of the door, me on the other. Right? Straight over their heads. They won't even know what hit them. 
HALL: Nah, not me, mate. 
KENNEDY: It's a bit late to argue, isn't it? They're outside. 
HALL: Now listen, I'm not getting mixed up in no kidnapping, and that's flat. 
(Hall turns for the door and Kennedy attacks him.)

[Outside the Warehouse]

(Jamie hears noises inside.) 
JAMIE: Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well, have you tried the door? 
(The Doctor opens the door.)

[Warehouse]

(Hall is lying on the floor.) 
DOCTOR: It's the man in the overalls. It's all right, he's alive. 
(Kennedy leaves unnoticed.) 
HALL: Where's Ken 
DOCTOR: Ken? Ken who? 
JAMIE: Make him tell us where the Tardis is! 
DOCTOR: No good, he's out cold. See if we can find some water somewhere. Hello, this is something. This really is something. 
(The Doctor has found the money.) 
DOCTOR: But why pay him to help steal the Tardis and then knock him on the head? 
JAMIE: Why steal the Tardis anyway? 
DOCTOR: That's what's been bothering me, Jamie, too. 
JAMIE: There's no water here. Hey, that looks a lot of money, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: It's between two and three hundred pounds. Yes, it is a lot, at least for what he had to do. Put on a pair of overalls and just hang around. Come to think of it, why hang around? He was obviously planted. Why not just go off in the lorry? 
JAMIE: You've found something else? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. 
(There are cigarettes and a matchbook on the windowsill. The Doctor searches Hall's pockets.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, this man rolled his own cigarettes, so these must belong to somebody else. That's a fair assumption. 
(A train rumbles past over the arches.) 
JAMIE: What's that? 
DOCTOR: It's all right. It's only a train. 
JAMIE: A what? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's a train. There are carriages and they go on wheels, on rails, and they're drawn by a steam. Hey, come back! 
(Hall rushes out of the door and fastens it with a metal bar through the handles.) 
JAMIE: Well, give us a hand. 
(When Jamie stops pushing the door, the bar falls out and the door opens.) 
JAMIE: Not a sign of him. The only chance we had. 
DOCTOR: There is this. (the matchbook) The Tricolour. It's a coffee bar, apparently. And that's not all. 
JAMIE: Well, what else? 
DOCTOR: Well, normally people pull out their matches from right to left. These have been torn out from left to right. 
JAMIE: What does that mean? 
DOCTOR: It means we've got to find a coffee bar called The Tricolour, and look for a man called Ken or Kenneth someone, who's left-handed. 
JAMIE: Now we've got something to go on. 
DOCTOR: But it's so little, Jamie. It's too little. He might only have been there once. There's no guarantee he'll ever go there again. 
JAMIE: Now, don't give up Doctor. Remember Bruce. 
DOCTOR: Bruce? 
JAMIE: Robert Bruce.

[Antique shop study]

KENNEDY: Look, I told you 
WATERFIELD: And they were not aware that you were watching? 
KENNEDY: No, they were too busy trying to work it all out. 
WATERFIELD: Good. 
KENNEDY: That Bob Hall was a bit of a problem. I didn't think he'd turn nasty. 
WATERFIELD: You didn't hurt him? 
KENNEDY: Him? You're joking. 
WATERFIELD: I can assure you that I am not. 
KENNEDY: He's a lot bigger than me, you know. No, I just battered him one and that was it. 
WATERFIELD: That was what, Kennedy? I must know precisely what has happened. How badly injured was Hall? 
KENNEDY: Well, a bit dazed, that's all. He just mumbled something then made a run for it when they weren't looking. 
WATERFIELD: And where is he now? 
KENNEDY: Well, I went round to his place later. There he was coming out the front door, zip bag and everything. He got in a cab and went to Euston. 
WATERFIELD: Were you able to find another hansom and follow him? 
KENNEDY: Ay? 
WATERFIELD: Did you follow him? 
KENNEDY: Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about him. He's gone up north. 
WATERFIELD: That disposes of that. Now, this is extremely important. You did leave the matches? 
KENNEDY: Don't worry about it. The Doctor found the cigarettes and the matches. 
WATERFIELD: And you are certain they were the ones bearing the name of the coffee shop? 
KENNEDY: Coffee bar. 
WATERFIELD: Yes. 
KENNEDY: Yes. I told you, it worked like a charm. I never thought it would, but you were quite right. He got onto the name on the matches straight away. 
WATERFIELD: Well, just one last thing, to make quite sure. 
(Waterfield takes two photographs from a deed box.) 
WATERFIELD: Now, you are certain that these are the people that you saw? 
KENNEDY: That's them, yeah. Yeah, definite. 
WATERFIELD: Right. Well, I shall want you to keep out of sight. You'd better stay in the house. And on no account are you to talk to Mister Perry about any of this. 
KENNEDY: Okay. 
WATERFIELD: Okay? What does that mean? 
KENNEDY: What? Yes! 
WATERFIELD: Oh, I know my attitude may appear strange to you on occasions, Kennedy. 
KENNEDY: You want to play the part of the Victorian grandfather, that's all right by me. Must be a pretty good gimmick. You pay me well enough. 
WATERFIELD: It helps to sell to our customers. 
KENNEDY: Yeah, sure, sure. You've never told me what it is exactly you've got against this Doctor and his friend. Some kind of vendetta or something? 
WATERFIELD: Explanations are not part of our arrangement. 
KENNEDY: Oh, just wondering. 
WATERFIELD: Imagination is a virtue, but it can become a vice. 
KENNEDY: Mind me own business. Yeah. I get the message. 
WATERFIELD: Ask Mister Perry to come and see me, will you please? 
(Kennedy leaves. Waterfield takes a key from the deed box and goes to the bookcase. He removes a large volume and puts the key into a hidden lock. Kennedy is watching from the hallway as the bookcase slides aside and Waterfield goes into a secret room. He comes out soon after carrying a large brown-paper parcel. He closes the secret door and puts it on the desk.)

[Antique shop hallway]

(Kennedy realises Perry is watching him.) 
KENNEDY: He wants to see us. 
PERRY: Oh, thank you. (He knocks four times on the door.)

[Antique shop study]

WATERFIELD: Who is it? 
PERRY [OC]: Perry, sir. 
WATERFIELD: One moment. 
PERRY: You wanted to see me, sir? 
WATERFIELD: Yes. I have an extremely important and delicate task for you to perform. 
PERRY: Oh, yes? I say, you got a new delivery. 
WATERFIELD: Yes. 
PERRY: I didn't see it arrive. 
WATERFIELD: It was delivered last night. I've only just brought it in myself. It is for a new customer. 
PERRY: Oh, yes? 
WATERFIELD: A Doctor Galloway. He's extremely wealthy and an ardent collector. 
PERRY: Of Victoriana, sir? 
WATERFIELD: No less. I do not know the Doctor personally, but we have arranged to meet in the coffee shop, er, bar, nearby. 
PERRY: The Tricolour, sir? 
WATERFIELD: Yes. Unfortunately, I am unable to keep the appointment, so I want you to go instead, Mister Perry. Here is a photograph of Doctor Galloway. This is his assistant and secretary, Mister James McCrimmon. Now, I want you to ask the Doctor to come to the shop tonight. Say at ten o' clock? 
PERRY: Ten o'clock, sir? 
WATERFIELD: Yes. Oh, don't worry, Mister Perry. I shall be attending to him myself. You needn't wait. 
PERRY: Oh, right, sir. 
WATERFIELD: The Doctor is notoriously unpunctual. I fear you may have a long and tedious wait. 
PERRY: I shall find him, sir. Do you want me to go now? 
WATERFIELD: If you please, Mister Perry. 
PERRY: Right. 
(Perry leaves, closing the door.)

[Antique shop hallway]

(Kennedy comes out of hiding and listens at the study door. Inside, Waterfield bolts the door and goes inside the secret room again. This area is bright, with a large packing case in one corner. A carved chair faces the far wall where two metal arms extend into the room, about four feet off the floor and eight feet apart. Waterfield adjusts some very un-Victorian equipment and sits in the chair as the machinery hums.) 
PERRY: And what are you doing? 
KENNEDY: I can't make Mister Waterfield hear me. I knocked. 
PERRY: He's busy. 
KENNEDY: Okay, I'll try later.

[Tricolour coffee bar]

('Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen' by the Seekers is playing on the jukebox.) 
JAMIE: Don't look so depressed, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: If only we knew what he looked like, Jamie. 
JAMIE: We'll ask one of the lasses in a moment, when things get quieter. 
DOCTOR: We've got to untangle this, you know. 
JAMIE: It's all quite obvious to me. 
DOCTOR: Oh? 
JAMIE: They're just robbers. Thieves, you understand. 
DOCTOR: No, no. There's more to it than that. Why leave that man in the hangar to give us a clue? 
JAMIE: Which we haven't followed up, you know. Leatherman. 
DOCTOR: There is no delivery firm of that name. Not in the London area, anyway. I checked in the phone book. 
JAMIE: But surely there's more places than London. 
DOCTOR: Maybe. 
JAMIE: Do you think this is some sort of a trap, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes. If only we knew who our enemies are. 
JAMIE: Not the Chameleons again! 
DOCTOR: No, something else. I can feel them, closing in all around us.

[Antique shop secret room]

WATERFIELD: I've done everything that you've asked of me. Isn't that enough? Now you must tell me the truth. Do you hear? The truth!

[Antique shop hallway]

(Kennedy is listening at the study door.) 
WATERFIELD [OC]: But you must tell me. I demand! I'm talking to you! Come back! 
(Waterfield comes out of the secret room, sweaty and tired, and locks it up. Then he lies down on his couch. With nothing more heard, Kennedy leaves.)

[Tricolour coffee bar]

(The Doctor is building a tower of sugar cubes as Jamie returns from the counter, evading the attentions of a young lady in a mini-kilt. The jukebox as moved onto Hold Tight by Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mitch and Titch.) 
JAMIE: Oh, if only the Laird could see that! Why do I get all the difficult tasks, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Because you're so much better at them than I am, Jamie. Now, what did you find out? 
JAMIE: None of the lasses here can remember anybody called Ken or Kenneth. 
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. 
JAMIE: Aye. But, they do have a different lot on duty in the evening. Now, maybe they'll know. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, I'm being stared at. Is there something wrong with me? 
JAMIE: You mean up here, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Is my hair in disarray? 
JAMIE: Well, no more than usual. 
DOCTOR: Do I look strange or bizarre? 
JAMIE: Aye. Well maybe I'm just used to you. 
DOCTOR: That's some comfort. Look out, he's coming over. 
PERRY: I beg your pardon. 
DOCTOR: Not at all. 
PERRY: It is Doctor Galloway, isn't it? 
JAMIE: Dr. Galloway? 
PERRY: and Mister McCrimmon. 
JAMIE: Aye, I'm Jamie McCrimmon. 
PERRY: My card. 
DOCTOR: Yes, er, Mister Perry? 
PERRY: Mister Waterfield's frightfully sorry, but he can't meet you as arranged. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, dear. What a pity. 
PERRY: But he said if you'd care to come to the shop at about ten tonight, he'll see to you personally. 
DOCTOR: At about 10. Oh, yes. We'll be there. 
PERRY: Right-ho. 
DOCTOR: Right. 
PERRY: Right. 
(Perry leaves.) 
DOCTOR: Edward Waterfield. Genuine Victoriana. 
JAMIE: It can't be a mistake. Even though he got your name wrong, he knew mine. 
DOCTOR: I wonder if Mister Kenneth has found us. 
JAMIE: Ay? 
DOCTOR: K. Perry, Esquire. Yes, I think we'll go and see Mister Edward Waterfield.

[Antique shop study]

WATERFIELD: And he definitely said he would be here? 
PERRY: Yes, sir. 
WATERFIELD: Thank you. You have done excellently, Mister Perry. Good night. 
PERRY: See you in the morning, sir? 
WATERFIELD: Yes. Yes, in the morning.

[Antique shop hallway]

(Waterfield follows Perry out, locking the study behind him. He hears the front door shut.) 
WATERFIELD: Kennedy. Kennedy? 
(Kennedy appears.) 
WATERFIELD: The Doctor is coming here tonight. I shall want you to help me. And you had better put some warm clothes on. Dark things. 
KENNEDY: All right. You'd better make sure that police box is well covered-up, in case the Doctor starts snooping about. 
WATERFIELD: Yes. 
(Waterfield leaves. Kennedy looks at his watch then the study door, then takes a lock-pick from his back pocket and breaks into the study before going back to the hall for his jacket and briefcase. In the study, he searches the desk drawers. Kennedy tries to force the deed box but fails. Searching for a hidden safe, he accidentally opens the door to the secret room.)

[Antique shop secret room]

(Kennedy enters. He examines the metal armatures whilst flicking switches. The mechanism hums. Kennedy checks his watch again, and continues searching until he finds the safe. As he tries to open it, a strange shape is forming behind him. Finally he succeeds and starts emptying it, then stops as he catches sight of an unearthly reflection in the metal. He turns to see a permanently annoyed mobile giant pepper pot behind him.) 
DALEK: Who are you? Who are you? Answer!

Episode Two

(From the Lost in Time DVD)

[Antique shop secret room]

(Kennedy tries to run for it, but the Dalek fires, killing him. Then it backs into the transmat device and disappears again.)

[Antique shop]

(The Doctor silences the door bell as they enter.) 
JAMIE: I don't know what you're being so cautious about. 
DOCTOR: Shh! 
JAMIE: They left the door open for us, didn't they? 
(A multitude of clocks chime.) 
JAMIE: Hey, it's half-past the nine o'clock. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. 
JAMIE: But they made the appointment for ten. Why have we come early? 
DOCTOR: The early bird catches the worm, Jamie. Now do be quiet, there's a good chap. And for heaven's sake, don't knock into anything. 
(The Doctor brushes past a statuette on a pedestal and Jamie catches it before it falls.) 
DOCTOR: Shh! 
(Jamie looks at the statuette.) 
JAMIE: Any good, this? 
DOCTOR: It's interesting. In fact, Jamie, it's quite remarkable. 
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, you know you told me outside it said Genuine Victorian Antiques? Well, all the stuff in here's brand new. 
DOCTOR: Hmm, you've noticed that. 
JAMIE: Of course I did. The man's a rogue. 
DOCTOR: Yes, so it seems. Except 
JAMIE: Except what? 
DOCTOR: Except that all these things are not reproductions. They're all genuine. 
JAMIE: Now, that's ridiculous. 
DOCTOR: Here, look at this. To one deed box, four guineas. This is a bill from William Dearing and Son, 1866. 
JAMIE: Then it's a forgery. 
DOCTOR: Yes. If you were going to make a forgery, wouldn't you try to dirty it up a bit? Yellow the edges, crinkle it up? This is brand new. 
JAMIE: I've got an idea. 
DOCTOR: What? 
JAMIE: All the stuff in here is genuine. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
JAMIE: But brand new. 
DOCTOR: Well done. 
JAMIE: Well, that is impossible, unless Waterfield could have invented a time machine like the Tardis, Doctor, and he's bringing all this stuff back from Victorian times. 
DOCTOR: But it's not very likely, is it? The only way to find out is to ask Waterfield.

[Antique shop study]

WATERFIELD: Kennedy!

[Antique shop secret room]

WATERFIELD: What happened? 
DALEK: The human discovered our communications system. 
WATERFIELD: And you murdered him? 
DALEK: He would have betrayed us. 
WATERFIELD: You don't have to kill! 
DALEK: Silence! 
WATERFIELD: I won't be silent! What are you dragging me into? You've destroyed a human life. Don't you understand that? 
DALEK: That is of no consequence. 
WATERFIELD: No consequence? 
DALEK: There is only one form of life that matters. Dalek life. Obey your orders, Waterfield. 
(The Dalek dematerializes.) 
WATERFIELD: No, wait, wait! What am I to do with the body? I can't, I can't go on with this.

[Antique shop]

DOCTOR: I'm sure I heard somebody shouting. Jamie, we've got to get in there. 
JAMIE: What about the wire? 
DOCTOR: It's too pliable. 
(They hear somebody coming, and hide. The shop door opens, ringing the bell. Waterfield checks the servant's indicator. The Doctor sneaks up behind the newcomer.) 
DOCTOR: Boo! 
PERRY: Oh! What are you doing here? 
DOCTOR: You made the appointment. 
PERRY: For ten o'clock. 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we thought we'd be early. What are you doing here? 
PERRY: I work here. 
JAMIE: Then what are you creeping about for? 
PERRY: Er. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think you've got some explaining to do, Mister Kenneth Perry. 
PERRY: My name isn't Kenneth, it's Keith. Now look, I don't understand this. 
DOCTOR: So, it's Keith. Do you know a man called Bob Hall? 
PERRY: Well, he's a man Mister Waterfield employs. 
DOCTOR: Well, he keeps some very rough company, including a man called Ken. 
PERRY: Ken. Kennedy? 
DOCTOR: What? What do you know about Kennedy? 
PERRY: Oh, wait a minute. This is all too quick for me. Look, I'll answer your questions, if you'll answer mine. 
(Waterfield takes the photograph of the Doctor into the secret room, takes a box out of a valise and tears the photograph in half. He then puts half the picture in the box to make it look as if it was torn and trapped as the lid was shut.) 
PERRY: This old police box was for a collector of curios. 
DOCTOR: But it belongs to me. 
PERRY: But why is it so important to you? 
DOCTOR: Because, because of what's inside it and because it happens to be my property. 
JAMIE: Look, where is it? 
PERRY: At the back. 
DOCTOR: Well, is there another way through? This door is locked. 
PERRY: We might be able to get over the yard gates. You see, this door has an electric lock on it. 
DOCTOR: You're going to show me where this yard of yours is. 
PERRY: I say, if it's a police box, shouldn't we get the police? 
(The door opens.) 
JAMIE: Doctor.

[Antique shop study]

PERRY: That's Kennedy! 
DOCTOR: He's dead. 
JAMIE: What are you doing? 
PERRY: Getting the police. What? 
(There's a buzzing sound on the line. Perry puts the telephone down.) 
PERRY: I don't think you ought to touch anything. I'll be as quick as I can. 
(Perry leaves.) 
JAMIE: Should we have let him go? 
DOCTOR: No, he's doing the right thing. 
JAMIE: But the Tardis? 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we'll have to find it before he comes back. Now I wonder what this telephone interference is. 
JAMIE: Looks as if Waterfield's cleared out. 
DOCTOR: Why make an appointment to see us at ten? 
JAMIE: Well, obviously, he didn't know he was going to have a fight with Kennedy. Och, come on Doctor, lets find the Tardis and go. 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the Tardis. Now, how did he die? His limbs are stiff, his hands clenched. Look, he died in horrible agony. Look at his face. Hello? 
(There is half a photograph in Kennedy's hand.) 
JAMIE: What? It's your picture! 
DOCTOR: Yes. Now, he fell like that, with his arm stretched out. Jamie, go out into the hall and measure the length of it up to the door here. 
(The Doctor paces out the study.) 
JAMIE: Fourteen, fifteen. 
DOCTOR: It's only five from the door to the wall. There must be another room behind here. 
JAMIE: Hey Doctor, there's a keyhole. 
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right. Now, Waterfield will have the key. We'd better find something to prise it open with. 
(The door opens.)

[Antique shop secret room]

(Waterfield watches from the study.) 
DOCTOR: Well, look at this. That's where your telephone interference is coming from. Oh, yes, this is interesting. 
JAMIE: Hey, the other half of your picture. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Don't open that! 
(Too late. A gas makes them collapse. Waterfield enters with a handkerchief over his mouth and closes the box. He stands in the transmat with the Doctor and Jamie.)

[Antique shop]

(Perry enters with a policeman.) 
PERRY: This way, along here. 
(Meanwhile Waterfield, the Doctor and Jamie dematerialise, along with the entire transmat apparatus.)

[Antique shop study]

PERRY: Here we are. That's funny. There were a couple of other gentlemen here. They seem to have disappeared.

[Maxtible's sitting room]

(Birdsong can be heard through the open doors. The Doctor and Jamie are tucked up on chairs, with blankets over them. The Doctor wakes, groaning, and there is a knock at the door. A maid servant enters with a tray.) 
MOLLIE: Hello sir. Are you feeling better? Oh, you did have a party last night, didn't you sir? The master sent this in for you. 
DOCTOR: The master? Mister Waterfield? 
MOLLIE: Oh, no, sir, Mister Maxtible. Mister Waterfield came back from abroad last night, sir, with you and the young gentleman. Don't you remember? 
DOCTOR: Not very well, no. Ooh! 
(Mollie pours a glass of liquid for the Doctor, which does him a power of good.) 
MOLLIE: I'd best not wake him. 
DOCTOR: What's your name? 
MOLLIE: Mollie Dawson, sir. 
DOCTOR: This works remarkably quickly, doesn't it? 
MOLLIE: Am I to pour some more? 
DOCTOR: No. No thank you, Mollie. But, you can tell me what the date is. 
MOLLIE: The date? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm feeling very much better, but I don't seem to be able to remember the date and where I am. 
MAXTIBLE: Mollie, that will do. The answers you require, sir, might come better from me. My name is Theodore Maxtible and I am the owner of this house. Pray, don't get up. I have the greatest sympathy for your condition, since I was the cause of it. 
(Underneath those whiskers is the wonderful Marius Goring.) 
DOCTOR: And this is Mister Edward Waterfield, I presume. You don't keep your appointments, do you? 
WATERFIELD: There were circumstances. 
DOCTOR: Yes, indeed there were. 
MAXTIBLE: Please, please, Doctor. First things first. You asked what date it was and where you were. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Well? 
MAXTIBLE: You're in my house, some miles from Canterbury. The date is June the 2nd, eighteen hundred and sixty six. 
DOCTOR: And just what do you think you're up to? You steal my property, you spirit Jamie and me a hundred years back in time and you murder a man along the way. 
MAXTIBLE: We had nothing to do with the death of that man. 
DOCTOR: I don't believe you! 
MAXTIBLE: You will believe, Doctor. We are all of us the victims of a higher power. A power more evil and more terrible than the human brain can imagine. 
DOCTOR: Power? Victims? What do you mean? 
WATERFIELD: They've taken my daughter, Victoria. 
DOCTOR: Who are they? 
MAXTIBLE: You will not be kept in suspense very much longer, Doctor. Pray, come with us and we will show you how it all began. 
WATERFIELD: Doctor, do whatever it is they ask, I beg of you. My daughter's life is in your hands. 
DOCTOR: I will listen, I promise. 
(Waterfield is looking at a portrait over the fireplace.) 
DOCTOR: Is that your daughter? 
WATERFIELD: No, sir. That is a painting of my wife as a young girl. She is dead now, rest her soul, but Victoria is the image of her.

[Victoria's room]

(Victoria is feeding the birds through the bars at her window when the door opens.) 
DALEK: You have not eaten. You will eat. That is an order. Answer! 
VICTORIA: Yes. 
DALEK: You will not feed the flying pests outside. Answer! 
VICTORIA: Yes. 
DALEK: Move to the machine. Move! 
(Victoria steps between two columns of lights, and there is a brain-splitting whine.
VICTORIA: No, no. 
(The numbers on the wall read 111-968, 2113-4, 7582-1) 
DALEK: Move. Move! The weight of your body has fallen by seventeen ounces. 
VICTORIA: What do you expect? What do you expect? For pity's sake, let me go! 
DALEK: Speak when you are told to speak! More food will come. Eat it, or you will be fed by force!

[Maxtible's laboratory]

(Lots of bubbling retorts and rubber tubing.) 
MAXTIBLE: Here we are, Doctor. This is hallowed ground. Here we shall not be disturbed by the servants. 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, very impressive. And now perhaps you'll explain what all this is about? 
MAXTIBLE: Patience, my dear sir, a little longer. 
DOCTOR: Patience? You don't seem to understand what's happened. A man has been murdered! You behave as though we're going on Sunday school outing. 
MAXTIBLE: Neither Whitefield nor I were responsible for his death. A cigar? 
DOCTOR: Why have you brought us here? Who are these enemies of yours, these ones you say control you? 
MAXTIBLE: Brilliant minds, Doctor. 
WATERFIELD: They are monsters. 
MAXTIBLE: Oh, I admit, Waterfield, they have behaved callously. 
WATERFIELD: Inhuman monsters! 
DOCTOR: Inhuman? 
WATERFIELD: Creations of the devil! 
MAXTIBLE: Let me explain. 
DOCTOR: Please do. 
MAXTIBLE: I have always been fascinated by the concept of travelling through time. Waterfield here is an expert in certain technical matters and I have the money to indulge my whims. Everything you see about you here was constructed by us two. 
DOCTOR: To try to find a way of exploring time? 
MAXTIBLE: Yes. Now this is my theory. A mirror reflects an image, does it not? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
MAXTIBLE: So, you may be standing there, and yet appear to be standing fifty feet away. Well, following the new investigations twelve years ago by J Clark Maxwell into electromagnetism and the experiments by Faraday into static electricity. 
DOCTOR: Static? 
MAXTIBLE: Correct. Waterfield and I first attempted to refine the image in the mirror, and then to project it. In here, Doctor, are one hundred and forty four separate mirrors. 
(They are behind a pair of gothic pointed doors.) 
WATERFIELD: And each is of polished metal. Each is subjected to electric charges, all positive. 
MAXTIBLE: Like repels like in electricity, Doctor, and so next, Waterfield and I attempted to repel the image in the mirrors, wherever we directed. 
DOCTOR: You mentioned static electricity. 
WATERFIELD: That was our last experiment. Negative and positive electricity had failed, so we tried static. If only we could have known the powers we were going to unleash. 
DOCTOR: Powers? 
WATERFIELD: In the middle of our final test with static, creatures burst out of the cabinet, invaded the house, took away my daughter. 
MAXTIBLE: Oh, my dear fellow. My dear, dear fellow. But we shall win through now that the Doctor is here. 
DOCTOR: These creatures? 
WATERFIELD: We had opened the way for them with our experiments. They forced me into the horror of time travel, Doctor. They ordered me to steal a box belonging to you and thus lure you into a trap and transport you here, together with your colleague Mister McCrimmon. 
DOCTOR: They knew about me, these creatures. 
MAXTIBLE: They gave us likenesses. 
WATERFIELD: What could I do? They said my daughter would die. 
DOCTOR: What are they called, these creatures? 
DALEK: Doctor! Now do you understand? 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Perfectly. 
DALEK: Move back! Our plan has worked. We shall triumph! You will obey! You will obey! 
DOCTOR: Obey? Obey? What do you want? 
DALEK: We have your time ship. We will destroy it unless you help us with an experiment. 
DOCTOR: What experiment? 
DALEK: You will help the Daleks test another human being. 
DOCTOR: What sort of test? 
DALEK: Do not question! 
DOCTOR: I will not be your slave! 
WATERFIELD: Doctor, I beg you. 
DALEK: No harm will come to you if you agree. Where is your companion? 
DOCTOR: Jamie? 
WATERFIELD: He is in the house. I have done everything you asked me to. 
DOCTOR: Why do you ask about Jamie? 
DALEK: He is the human being who is to be tested. 
DOCTOR: What do you mean? Tested how? 
DALEK: Silence! You will reveal nothing to your companion. Obey the Daleks! You are in our power! 
(The Dalek goes into the mirrored room.) 
DOCTOR: What have you done with your infernal meddling? What is this test? Do either of you know? 
WATERFIELD: No. 
MAXTIBLE: I believe I do. They, I mean the Daleks, tell me they have always been defeated by human beings. 
DOCTOR: In the long run, yes. 
MAXTIBLE: Possibly because of some factor, possessed by human beings 
DOCTOR: Possibly. 
MAXTIBLE: That is absent in Daleks. 
DOCTOR: Possibly. 
MAXTIBLE: Perhaps they want to find out what it is and transplant it into their race. 
WATERFIELD: But if they do that, allied with their own alien intelligence, they'll be invincible! Maxtible, you should've 
MAXTIBLE: Oh, my dear fellow. I am merely surmising. I know nothing definite. But, besides, what could we have done? Even if I had known for certain, the fact was, nay is, they hold your daughter, Victoria. 
DOCTOR: And now they've got Jamie.

[Maxtible's sitting room]

MOLLIE: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to wake you. There. 
(Jamie clutches his head.) 
JAMIE: Oh, it's not funny. Oh. 
MOLLIE: The master left this for you to drink, sir. This'll clear away the cobwebs. Here you are, sir. 
JAMIE: Where's the Doctor? Oh. 
MOLLIE: He's with the master and Mister Waterfield, sir. 
JAMIE: Waterfield? 
RUTH: Mollie? What are you doing here? 
(Welcome Brigit Forsyth, everyone.) 
MOLLIE: Just seeing to the young gentleman, miss. 
RUTH: Go and bring some tea. Well, go along. 
(Mollie leaves.) 
RUTH: Please, Mister McCrimmon. 
JAMIE: You know my name? 
RUTH: My father told me that you and your friend arrived last night with Mister Waterfield. 
JAMIE: Your father? I'm sorry but I seem to have great difficulty in remembering anything. 
RUTH: He owns this house. I'm his daughter, Ruth Maxtible. 
JAMIE: How do you do? Have you seen the Doctor this morning? 
RUTH: He's talking with my father. He'll be along presently. Do you have everything you need? 
JAMIE: I don't know what this stuff is, but it seems to work all right. 
RUTH: Mollie shall bring you some tea in a minute. 
JAMIE: I'm obliged to you. Er, Miss Maxtible? 
RUTH: Yes? 
JAMIE: Could you tell me who that is in the portrait? 
RUTH: That's a portrait of Mister Waterfield's late wife. 
JAMIE: She was very lovely. 
RUTH: Yes, and his daughter looks just like her. You're quite comfortable? 
JAMIE: Yes. Thank you. 
(Ruth leaves. Jamie starts to search a writing bureau as a ruffian enters through the French windows and hides behind a curtain. He is played by Windsor Davies.) 
JAMIE: Eighteen sixty six. So that's what Waterfield's done. 
(Jamie looks around the room then picks up his blanket and moves his chair to face the couch. Toby the ruffian hits him over the back of the head then leaves when there is a knocking on the door.) 
MOLLIE: Here we are sir. I've been as quick as I could. Shall I pour for you? Poor young gentleman. They shouldn't have given you so much to drink. 
(Toby returns and grabs Mollie from behind with his hand over her mouth.)

[Maxtible's hallway]

WATERFIELD: Doctor, I do ask you to consider. 
DOCTOR: I have made up my mind. 
MAXTIBLE: But they ordered you not to tell your friend McCrimmon anything. 
DOCTOR: Do you think I'm going to allow Jamie to run into danger without telling him anything? No, I will not. 
MAXTIBLE: But suppose he refuses to do what they want? 
DOCTOR: We shall see.

[Maxtible's sitting room]

DOCTOR: He's still asleep. The gas in that box of yours was pretty potent. 
WATERFIELD: It was Maxtible's invention. 
DOCTOR: Jamie. 
(But it is not Jamie under the blanket.) 
WATERFIELD: Mollie!

[Maxtible's laboratory]

DALEK: Order the Doctor to begin the test. 
MAXTIBLE: But I must first explain to him what he has to do. 
DALEK: Go now. Obey the Daleks!

[Maxtible's sitting room]

(The Doctor is examining marks on the floor with his magnifying glass.) 
WATERFIELD: But your friend is vital to the plan of these Daleks. Absolutely essential. 
DOCTOR: So it seems. So who can have kidnapped him? 
WATERFIELD: Oh, why won't you understand? The threats they make are not idle ones. Kennedy was murdered. Without your friend, our only hope is gone unless, unless you know something. You seem to be well acquainted with the creatures. 
DOCTOR: Everything you say, Waterfield, is true. If we cannot find Jamie, the Daleks will take pleasure in killing everyone in sight, and their greatest pleasure will be in killing me.

[Dalek's room]

DALEK: The humans have been told to begin the test. 
DALEK 2: Any delay will result in death. 
DALEK: There will be no delay. 
Episode Three

[Maxtible's sitting room]

WATERFIELD: Mollie, Mollie. Mister McCrimmon has been kidnapped. It means the end of us unless we can find him quickly. 
DOCTOR: Straw. 
WATERFIELD: I beg your pardon? 
DOCTOR: A piece of straw. 
(It was stuck in the mud by the French windows.)

[Stables]

TOBY: Had a cosy little sleep, young swell? 
(Jamie pushes him away.) 
TOBY: Lively, is it? Maybe you'd like to sleep again? I've got Mister Nod here. He'll have you snoring as good as ever. 
JAMIE: What do you want? 
TOBY: I'm to be well paid. Have no fear of that. 
JAMIE: Aye, and for what? I don't know you. 
(Another man enters. He is very well-spoken.) 
TOBY: This your man, sir? 
TERRALL: Toby! What in Hades have you done? 
TOBY: Why, I brought him from the house, like you said. 
TERRALL: I said nothing of the kind. 
TOBY: Well, you did, sir. Honest you did. A guinea you promised me, and I done what you said. You don't get out of paying. 
TERRALL: Be careful how you speak to me, Toby. There's your money. Get out! 
(Toby picks up the coin and leaves. Terrall steps towards Jamie then stops. He appears to be in great pain. Then he is suddenly normal again.) 
TERRALL: Where's Toby? 
JAMIE: You just sent him about his business. Look, what's the matter? Are you all right? 
TERRALL: Where's Victoria Waterfield? 
JAMIE: I don't know. 
TERRALL: Yes, you do. 
JAMIE: I tell you, I don't even know her. 
TERRALL: You're in the house, a friend of Maxtible's. You must know. 
JAMIE: No, listen, I'm telling 
(Terrall grimaces in pain again, then recovers.) 
TERRALL: Ah ha, I must apologise for that villain Toby. He was telling lies, of course. I shall escort you to the house. 
JAMIE: You just asked me about Victoria Waterfield. 
TERRALL: She's in Paris. I'm afraid I haven't introduced myself. Arthur Terrall. 
JAMIE: No, never mind about that. Did you or did you not, ask that man to knock me on the head and bring me in here? 
TERRALL: I, oh certainly not! 
JAMIE: Oh. Doctor! 
(The DOCTOR enters.) 
TERRALL: Oh. I see you're in good hands now. I won't detain you any further. Good day, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Oh, good day to you. 
(Terrall leaves.) 
JAMIE: He's mad. Stark, staring mad. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. I was listening. Let's have a look at that head of yours. 
JAMIE: Och, it's all right. 
DOCTOR: Come along. 
JAMIE: One minute he says this, the next minute he says that. Can you make it out, Doctor? I'm knocked on the head and I'm brought in here. Then that man Terrall enters and denies having ordered the other man to do it. Well, then he changes, and he starts asking about Victoria Waterfield and in the next breath, he tells me she's in Paris. 
DOCTOR: I know what's happened to Victoria. 
JAMIE: What has? 
DOCTOR: She's a prisoner of the Daleks.

[Victoria's room]

DALEK: Hurry! 
VICTORIA: Why am I being moved? Are you taking me back to my father? 
DALEK: No. You are being moved. Pick up your cover. Follow. Do not be afraid. You are not to be exterminated.

[Corridor]

DALEK: Do not delay. 
(Victoria stops at a window to look outside at the gardens.) 
DALEK 2: Move.

[Maxtible's sitting room]

WATERFIELD: You warned him, told him about the Daleks? 
DOCTOR: Yes, of course I did! 
WATERFIELD: But you were expressly told 
DOCTOR: Oh, fiddlesticks! Bosh! Jamie will cooperate. You may be certain of that. 
WATERFIELD: Are you sure? 
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly sure. Jamie will do everything he is asked to do. Now come along, we must go and find Maxtible. 
(Jamie has overheard this, and is worried.)

[Maxtible's laboratory]

(Maxtible is working when a Dalek comes out of the mirrored room.) 
DALEK: The female human being has been moved. 
MAXTIBLE: Everything is prepared. 
DALEK: The testing equipment is ready? 
MAXTIBLE: I think you will be pleased with the man I have had specially brought from London. He works in my house. 
DALEK: Show me. 
MAXTIBLE: You will understand that he is rather simple. He is quite dumb, but that has its advantages for us. His mind is, how shall I say, undeveloped. He will not understand you, the Daleks. I mean, he will be terrified of you. 
DALEK: Show me. 
MAXTIBLE: Oh, I beg your pardon. 
(The Dalek backs into the mirrored room to watch. Maxtible calls into the corridor.) 
MAXTIBLE: Kemel! 
(A giant man appears, in traditional Turkish dress.) 
MAXTIBLE: Will you come with me? I want you to stand here. No, no, no, no, no, face the cabinet. Good. 
(Maxtible gives Kemel a thick iron bar.) 
MAXTIBLE: Now, bend that. 
(Kemel tests the bar against his leg, then removes his waistcoat and shirt and starts to bend the bar against the back of his neck. Then he removes it and finishes the job with upper body strength alone.) 
MAXTIBLE: Excellent, Kemel, excellent. Now, you'll help me with these stools. 
(Maxtible puts two stools a short distance apart and puts a thick plank of wood across the top.) 
MAXTIBLE: There. Now, Kemel, one blow. Break the plank! 
(He does so with one fist.) 
MAXTIBLE: Very good, Kemel. I'm very pleased with you. Now you can put on your jacket. Come over here. Now, I want you to listen carefully. You see this man? 
(He shows Kemel a photograph of Jamie.) 
MAXTIBLE: Now, I'm going to take you to a place that I want you to guard. This young man will try and get past you and you are not to let him. Do you understand? Oh, he's an evil villain, Kemel. A cutthroat who would gladly murder us all in our beds if he could. You will remember this man? Right. Well, you come with me and I will direct you. 
(Maxtible and Kemel leave, and the Dalek comes out to look closely at the bent iron bar.)

[Alcove]

MAXTIBLE: You wait here. 
(Maxtible takes a candle and matches from an upper shelf.)
MAXTIBLE: This is the entrance to the south wing of my house, and through here will pass the man I showed you in the picture. The door itself is an obstacle. 
(Maxtible presses a hidden switch and a door at the back of the alcove opens.) 
MAXTIBLE: No, no, wait! 
(Maxtible stops Kemel getting speared by metal spikes that thud down across the entrance. He presses a second switch and the spikes retract.) 
MAXTIBLE: Now, if he gets through here, you will deal with him. Go now. 
(Kemel moves down the corridor. Maxtible closes the alcove door and blows out the candle.)

[Maxtible's laboratory]

DALEK: We do not trust you. 
DOCTOR: Then we're quits, aren't we? 
DALEK: But we have your time machine. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
DALEK: So, you will obey us. 
DOCTOR: They want the human Factor, is that right? 
WATERFIELD: Yes, that is what they want. 
DOCTOR: Very complex. And you want to introduce this human factor into the race of Daleks? 
DALEK: Yes, the conquest of humanity has eluded us. The Daleks must know why. 
DOCTOR: Well why choose Jamie for this test? 
DALEK: His travelling with you makes him unique. 
DOCTOR: But why him, why not me? 
DALEK: Request denied. 
DOCTOR: Why? 
DALEK: You have travelled too much through time. You are more than human. 
DOCTOR: I see. What is this? 
(Three large packing cases beside the workbench. Maxtible enters.) 
MAXTIBLE: They have been brought from the Dalek planet. 
DOCTOR: Skaro? 
DALEK: Yes. 
(Maxtible removes the lid from one case. Inside is a Dalek without it's metal casing.) 
DALEK: their life force is dormant. Before it is activated, we want 
DOCTOR: You want the human factor introduced. I see. 
DALEK: You will obey us. 
DOCTOR: I will make up my own mind! 
WATERFIELD: Do not antagonise them, Doctor. They will destroy your time machine. 
DOCTOR: And if I agree, it means the creation of a race of super Daleks. My Tardis. I have no choice, do I. Very well, I agree. 
DALEK: The human being with you must not be aware of the trial. 
DOCTOR: I quite understand. 
DALEK: Make him begin the test. 
(The Dalek goes into the mirrored room.) 
DOCTOR: What must Jamie do? 
MAXTIBLE: Attempt to rescue Waterfield's daughter.

[Maxtible's sitting room]

(Jamie is waiting when Mollie shows in Ruth and Terrall.) 
MOLLIE: There we are, sir. 
RUTH: Thank you, Mollie. Arthur, I'd like you to meet Mister McCrimmon. 
TERRALL: May I ask what you are doing in this house? 
JAMIE: I was just about to ask you the same thing. 
RUTH: Oh, you gentlemen have been introduced? 
JAMIE: Aye, we've met. 
TERRALL: It seems, Ruth, your father has the oddest collection of house guests these days. 
RUTH: Now, Arthur, please. You must forgive him, Mister McCrimmon. 
JAMIE: Ah, it's becoming a habit. 
TERRALL: I don't care for insolence. 
JAMIE: Well, I'm not keen on arrogance myself. 
RUTH: Why, you bite at each other as if you were old enemies. 
JAMIE: I'm sorry if I seem rude. 
RUTH: Come, I want you to be friends. Won't you be so, to please me? 
(Terrall has another painful attack.) 
RUTH: Arthur? Arthur, what is it? 
(Terrall runs from the room.) 
RUTH: Excuse me. Arthur! What's the matter? 
(Ruth follows Terrall. Shortly afterwards, Mollie enters.) 
MOLLIE: Sir? 
JAMIE: Yes? Oh, I wish you'd call me Jamie. 
MOLLIE: Oh, I couldn't do that, sir. What would the master say? 
JAMIE: Oh, who cares? What can I do for you? 
MOLLIE: If you'd tell me where your bags are, sir, yours and the Doctor, I'll have them taken up to your room. 
JAMIE: Aye. Well, Mollie 
MOLLIE: Listen to me. Have them taken. I daresay I'll be doing it meself! 
JAMIE: You see, we didn't have time to pick up the luggage. It'll be following. 
MOLLIE: Oh. 
JAMIE: Why do you say you'll be doing it yourself? 
MOLLIE: Well, they do say, sir, that the house is haunted. Mister Kitson, the butler, left, and cook and the two footmen are complaining again. 
JAMIE: Haunted? 
MOLLIE: Mmm. But, I've never heard anything, sir. I sleep like a log and always have. 
JAMIE: Aye. Well, I'm glad you've got over the fright you had. 
MOLLIE: Oh, yes, that horrible man. Miss Ruth said it was all a game, but I don't know, sir. I've never fainted before, sir. Truly I haven't. 
JAMIE: Not sir, Jamie. Tell me about Arthur Terrall. 
MOLLIE: Miss Ruth's fiancé, sir? 
JAMIE: Aye. 
MOLLIE: Oh. Oh, he's a kind man, sir. Usually. 
JAMIE: Usually? 
MOLLIE: Mmm. Well, when he's a bit odd or his temper's up, as it has been lately, I says to myself, Inkerman, and then it's all right. 
JAMIE: Inkerman? 
MOLLIE: Yes sir. He was out in the Crimea, he was. They do say Mister Terrall was wounded out there. 
(The Doctor enters quietly.) 
MOLLIE: Do you know, my uncle was killed at Inkerman, sir. So, you see, I do know what it's like with soldiers. Oh! oh, I'm sorry, sir. 
DOCTOR: It's all right, Mollie. 
MOLLIE: I didn't mean to. 
DOCTOR: Never mind. 
MOLLIE: Well, cook said to me that if I did some dusting it would be all right. 
DOCTOR: That'll do. Yes, Mollie, thank you very much. It's all right. 
MOLLIE: You won't tell the master, will you? 
DOCTOR: I wouldn't dream of telling him. 
MOLLIE: Thank you, sir. Sorry. 
DOCTOR: Thank you very much. Bye bye. 
(Mollie leaves.) 
DOCTOR: You'll have to brush up on your history. I can't be around to cover up for you all the time. Now then, in the Crimean War, the English, the French and the Turks fought the Russians. 
JAMIE: Oh, forget about all that! 
DOCTOR: Oh, I thought you'd be interested. I watched the Charge of the Light Brigade. Magnificent folly. 
JAMIE: Look, where've you been? 
DOCTOR: Oh, just looking around. 
JAMIE: Aye. What for, the Tardis? 
DOCTOR: Jamie, you're in a temper! 
JAMIE: Oh, am I? Is that bad, then? Does that mean I won't be co-operative. I won't do everything I'm told? 
DOCTOR: What was that? 
JAMIE: I overheard you and Waterfield. 
DOCTOR: You were eavesdropping. 
JAMIE: Well, whatever it is, I don't like what you're doing. 
DOCTOR: Now, you listen to me, Jamie! 
JAMIE: No, Doctor. You're forgetting the Tardis was stolen and a man was murdered. Now, how am I supposed to tell when I see you as friendly as you like with the murderer. 
DOCTOR: Waterfield did not murder that man! 
JAMIE: All right, then. But he stole the Tardis and that still makes him a thief. 
DOCTOR: The Daleks forced him to! 
JAMIE: The Daleks! You keep telling me about the Daleks, and I haven't even seen one. You're always on about them, but where are they? 
DOCTOR: Now, you listen to me. 
JAMIE: No, you'll not get round me this time, Doctor. You're up to something with Waterfield and Maxtible. Now what is it? Some scientific invention? Ah, here's your friend. 
DOCTOR: Just a little argument. 
WATERFIELD: I heard voices raised. 
JAMIE: That's not all you'll hear! 
DOCTOR: Jamie seems to think that I'm lying to him. 
JAMIE: Well, aren't you? 
DOCTOR: He doesn't believe the Daleks are here. 
WATERFIELD: It's the truth. 
JAMIE: Aye, the truth you told Arthur Terrall, maybe, that your daughter was in Paris. 
WATERFIELD: I had to tell him that. 
JAMIE: So you've got another story to tell me? 
WATERFIELD: I tell you that the Daleks are holding my daughter prisoner in the south wing of this house, Mister McCrimmon. 
JAMIE: Then why don't you try and get her back, ay? What are you doing? 
DOCTOR: Well, what can I do? Now, be fair, Jamie. Waterfield's tied hand and foot because of his daughter, and we're tied hand and foot because of the Tardis! 
JAMIE: Aye, and that's all you can think about, isn't it? The Tardis. Well, you can all stand around doing nothing. I'm sick to death of it. 
DOCTOR: Now just where are you going? 
JAMIE: To be by myself for a bit. Do you mind? 
DOCTOR: No, not a bit. But one word of warning. Don't you try to be a one-man army. You leave well alone. I won't have you ruining everything trying to rescue Victoria Waterfield. Now, you understand? 
(Jamie pushes the Doctor out of his way and leaves.) 
WATERFIELD: Well, are you sure you didn't go a little too far, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Adding a little fuel to the fire. Tell Maxtible that I'll be along to his laboratory shortly. 
WATERFIELD: Oh, very well, Doctor, if you're sure. 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, quite sure. Once our young friend has cooled his heels a bit, he'll launch off on his own. And you dropped the hint about the south wing beautifully.

[Stables]

TERRALL: Well, what is it? You wanted to see me. 
TOBY: Very good of you to talk to me, gov'nor. 
TERRALL: Well, never mind all that. I'll give you two minutes, no more. 
TOBY: I want me rights. No more, no less. 
TERRALL: What do you mean, rights? 
TOBY: Half a guinea, you gave me, and it ain't what we said. 
TERRALL: You were lucky to get anything. 
TOBY: That ain't fair. 
TERRALL: You'll get no more from me. I warn you, keep away from this house and this property. Find the nearest road to London and take it. 
TOBY: Oh, yeah, London, sir. Yeah. I daresay I could earn something for me stories there. 
TERRALL: Stories? 
TOBY: Oh, I won't detain an important gentleman like yourself. Like as not me two minutes is up anyway. 
TERRALL: What do you mean, stories? 
TOBY: It's all right, sir. I'll take a stroll to London. 
TERRALL: Don't play with me. 
TOBY: Get off me. If you must know, there's plenty who'd pay to hear what I've got to tell them. 
TERRALL: Indeed. 
TOBY: Yeah. You blows too hot and cold for me, telling me this one minute and that the next and not paying up. 
TERRALL: You know nothing. 
TOBY: Don't I, though? 
TERRALL: Who'd believe you anyway? 
TOBY: Pay me off, and there's the end of it. 
TERRALL: Oh, blackmail is it? Get out. 
(Toby starts to leave, but Terrall has one of his attacks, grabs a pitchfork and lunges at Toby. Toby manages to knock him out. He searches his pockets and finds gold coins and a set of keys.) 
TOBY: Maybe I don't know much to tell, but I'll wager I'll find something in the house that's worth me trouble. So I'll say thank you, Mister Terrall, sir.

[Maxtible's sitting room]

(The moon shines down on the house. Mollie brings an oil lamp in.) 
JAMIE: It's only me, Mollie. 
MOLLIE: It's over here, sir. I took it from the master's study. 
JAMIE: It's marvellous. Thank you. 
MOLLIE: Here, is this what you wanted? 
(It's a plan of the house.) 
JAMIE: Perfect, yes. Let's see. This is the south wing here? 
MOLLIE: Yes sir, but it's been closed off. 
JAMIE: Completely? 
MOLLIE: Oh no, sir. only because of some repairs about a twelve month back. But the door may be locked. 
JAMIE: Can you show me? 
MOLLIE: All right. 
(Jamie takes the map and lamp.) 
MOLLIE: What're you going to do, sir? 
JAMIE: I'm off to hunt a few ghosties, Mollie.

[Workroom]

DOCTOR: Every single one of Jamie's reactions will be recorded on these Dalek machines. 
MAXTIBLE: And then transformed into thought patterns on silver wire. A wonderful creation. 
DALEK1: It is for you, Doctor, to select the major feelings to make up this human factor. 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. I quite understand. 
MAXTIBLE: We can rely on the Doctor to give us all cooperation. 
DALEK: We shall watch your every move. 
DOCTOR: I'm sure you will. And every step of Jamie's progress will be covered? 
DALEK: Yes. 
DALEK 2: The young human being is on his way. 
MAXTIBLE: Then the recording machines can be set in action.

[Alcove]

(Mollie leads Jamie to the hidden doorway.) 
JAMIE: Here? 
MOLLIE: Yes, sir. I once remember the master stepping away from here. When he saw me, he was very cross and told me to keep away. 
JAMIE: I see. 
(Jamie searches the alcove.)

[Maxtible's laboratory]

(Toby has got into the house using Terrall's keys and is searching the place for loot. He looks into a packing case then is aware of movement on the other side of the room. A Dalek glides towards him. Toby tries to run and gets killed, screaming as he dies.)

[Alcove]

(The scream is heard through the house.) 
MOLLIE: What was that? What was that? 
JAMIE: That was no ghost, Mollie, that's for sure. That was a human voice. 
MOLLIE: Oh, sir. 
JAMIE: Look, Mollie, take the candle and go back to your room. Will you do that? 
MOLLIE: Yes, sir. 
JAMIE: Now, do you want me to see you safely there? 
MOLLIE: No, no. I'll be all right. 
(Mollie leaves. Jamie finds the candle and matches on the shelf and lights it. He finds greasy fingerprints on the doorframe and the hidden switches. The door opens. As Jamie moves forward, hot wax drips onto his fingers and he stops to wipe it off just as the metal spikes thud down in front of him. Jamie ducks under the spikes into the next corridor.)

[South wing]

(Jamie sees movement in the moonlit corridor. It is Kemel.) 
JAMIE: Hello. Who are you?

Episode Four

[South wing]

(Kemel steps forward, arms outstretched. Jamie ducks underneath them. Kemel grabs Jamie's fist and squeezes it. Jamie shoulders Kemel's stomach and the wrestler staggers back releasing his hand. They circle each other until Jamie elbows Kemel in the stomach again with no effect. Kemel gets a glancing blow on Jamie, knocking him down. Then Kemel kicks out and Jamie grabs his foot, making him fall backwards onto a chair which breaks. Next, Kemel gets Jamie in a headlock but Jamie gets his foot behind Kemel's knee and overbalances them both. They exchange kicks and blows until Kemel hits his head against the wall. Jamie goes into the nearest room and shuts the door.)

[South wing room]

(It is full of dusty furniture and packing cases. Kemel rushes in. Jamie dodges at the last moment and Kemel goes out through an open window. Jamie looks out to see Kemel sliding down a small roof until he is just hanging on to the gutter two stories above the ground. Jamie throws down a rope and braces himself as the wrestler climbs back up to safety. Meanwhile, A Dalek takes an embroidered lace handkerchief into Victoria's old room and puts it on the floor. Kemel climbs back through the window and shakes his head. Jamie goes back to the corridor and Kemel does not follow.)

[Victoria's room]

(Jamie passes an open doorway and sees the handkerchief on the floor. He looks around and goes to pick it up. Suddenly Kemel knocks him over onto the bed. An axe swings out of the wall and slices through the air where Jamie had been standing. The pair continue the search together. A Dalek watches them go.)

[Dalek laboratory]

DOCTOR: It took courage to fight Maxtible's Turkish wrestler. 
DALEK: The Daleks are afraid of nothing and no-one. 
DOCTOR: But Jamie saved the Turk's life. 
DALEK: Human weakness. 
DOCTOR: If he hadn't, he would have died in that room of yours. If you want the human factor, a part of it must include mercy.

[Maxtible's laboratory]

WATERFIELD: What is he doing here? 
MAXTIBLE: (A common thief, come to see what he could steal. No mystery here. 
(A Dalek comes out of the mirror room.) 
DALEK: The intruder was destroyed. 
WATERFIELD: Well, what are we to do? Where is the Doctor? He must be told. 
DALEK: No. 
WATERFIELD: Why not? 
DALEK: Obey me! 
MAXTIBLE: Waterfield, I beg of you, do not antagonise the, er, our friends. 
WATERFIELD: Oh, why do you consistently avoid reality, Maxtible? Another man has died. Can't you grasp that fact? 
DALEK: You will hide the remains of the dead human intruder. 
WATERFIELD: No! 
DALEK: That is an order! 
MAXTIBLE: We must do as they say, Waterfield. We cannot anger them. Here. Here, wrap the body in this. 
WATERFIELD: No. 
MAXTIBLE: We must. Have you lost your mind? Don't you want to see your daughter again? 
WATERFIELD: There's no end to this. The hands of the Devil. 
DALEK: Dispose of the body. Obey! 
MAXTIBLE: Waterfield, what is the matter with you? We are not to blame for everything that has happened. No English judge or jury would find it in their hearts to convict us of one solitary thing. 
WATERFIELD: It'll never come to that. 
MAXTIBLE: And what may that remark mean? 
WATERFIELD: I have one purpose only, to see my daughter out of the hands of those foul monsters. When that is achieved, I shall confess my part in all that has happened. 
(As Waterfield finishes wrapping Toby's corpse in a sheet, Maxtible opens a drawer in his workbench and removes a small pistol which he slips into his coat. Waterfield struggles to drag the body to the door.)
WATERFIELD: You must help me. 
MAXTIBLE: I am at your heels, my dear sir.

[South wing]

(Kemel helps Jamie to a window for some fresh air.) 
JAMIE: That's better, thank you. Aye, you're an odd one. I'll say that. Aye, well, I suppose we're both a bit touched, eh? Knocking each other about the place and saving one another's lives. You don't say much, do you? 
(Kemel touches his lips and shakes his head.) 
JAMIE: Oh, I see. You can't talk. Aye. Well, you're a sight better than a number of people I know who can. I wonder what your name is? 
(The Turk writes his name in the dust.) 
JAMIE: Kemel? Well, I'm Jamie. 
(Kemel bows over Jamie's hand.) 
JAMIE: Hey, what is that? Now, come on now. I want none of that. We're to be friends, d'you hear? Friends. 
(Kemel sees the handkerchief Jamie is holding.) 
JAMIE: Aye. 
(Kemel points to the initials on it.) 
JAMIE: V.W. I know. Victoria Waterfield. 
(Kemel pulls a piece of folded paper from his belt. It contains a pressed flower.) 
JAMIE: Oh, Miss Waterfield gave you the flower? You like her? Of course. Then what are we fighting for? Do you not know what I'm doing here, Kemel? Victoria Waterfield is being held a prisoner here somewhere. Together? Aye, we'll go together. There's no one I'd rather have with me.

[Dalek laboratory]

(The Doctor adjusts the recording machine.)

[Stables]

(Waterfield and Maxtible carry in Toby's body and put it in a stall.) 
WATERFIELD: What was that? Did you hear it? 
MAXTIBLE: Control your nerves. 
WATERFIELD: But there was a noise. 
MAXTIBLE: Waterfield, go back to the house. 
WATERFIELD: No, we have a task to perform. 
MAXTIBLE: Waterfield, I am sick to death of you. 
WATERFIELD: What? 
MAXTIBLE: I take you into my house, you and your daughter, provide for you. 
WATERFIELD: Yes, I know everything that you've done. 
MAXTIBLE: Small thanks do I get for it. I did not bring these terrible creatures here deliberately, you know that. Am I to blame for everything? 
WATERFIELD: No, no. 
MAXTIBLE: It is your daughter they have kidnapped. One moment you beg me to do everything I can to rescue her, next moment you blame me. 
WATERFIELD: Yes, I don't mean it like that. It's the price. First Kennedy, now this fellow. How many people must die so that my daughter can live? 
MAXTIBLE: We are not the murderers. 
WATERFIELD: No, just the silent partners. But we're equally to blame because we stand by and do nothing. 
MAXTIBLE: Go back to the house, Waterfield. I understand you are under a stress. You try and get some sleep. 
WATERFIELD: Sleep? I've not had one good night's rest since this started. 
MAXTIBLE: Well, you go back to your room. Near the end now. You have done enough. 
(Waterfield leaves. Maxtible aims his pistol at his back. Terrall steps out of the shadows and knocks the gun away.) 
MAXTIBLE: What are you doing? 
TERRALL: Waterfield does not die yet. 
MAXTIBLE: He says he will confess everything. 
TERRALL: Go back to the laboratory. I will dispose of the body. You will obey. You will obey!

[South wing]

(Jamie and Kemel hide in an alcove as a Dalek goes past.) 
JAMIE: Wait. Never mind about those, Kemel, unless they catch sight of us. We seem to be going in the right direction. 
(They follow the Dalek at a distance, but they are being monitored in the Dalek laboratory. Jamie touches a small button in the wall at waist height and an alarm sounds.) 
JAMIE: Down! 
(A spotlight glares down and a huge ball on a pendulum swings between them, just missing their heads as they lie on the floor. Jamie and Kemel continue along the corridor very carefully.)

[Dalek laboratory]

(The Doctor makes more adjustments.) 
DALEK: We do not trust you. What thoughts are you using now? 
DOCTOR: Human beings have five senses. Sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. But there is instinct, too. Jamie used instinct to avoid your trap.

[Banqueting hall]

(The corridor ends in a large hall with an open fireplace, and a minstrel's gallery at the far end. As Jamie watches, two Daleks enter and look up at the gallery. A door opens and Victoria steps out.) 
DALEK: Name? 
VICTORIA: Victoria. 
DALEK: Louder. 
VICTORIA: Victoria! Victoria Waterfield! You know my name! 
DALEK: Silence. Inspection is over. Return to your room. 
JAMIE: She's very beautiful, Kemel. 
(Kemel smiles and takes a mace from the wall.) 
JAMIE: What are you going to do with that? You'll attack the Daleks, draw them off down the corridor, while I go up there and rescue her somehow? It's too dangerous, Kemel. Besides, it needs two of us up there. Oh, but how?

[Dalek laboratory]

DALEK: What is the significance of this thought pattern? 
DOCTOR: Suicidal attacks to gain an objective. Postulate. Self-preservation is a strong human factor. Jamie and his new friend are determined to succeed, but finding the girl is only part. Getting her away is another.

[Trophy room]

(Terrall drags Mollie inside.) 
TERRALL: You'll come in here, Mollie, and explain yourself. 
MOLLIE: Oh, sir, please, sir, You're hurting me! 
TERRALL: Now, what is this hysterical nonsense? 
MOLLIE: But, sir, I heard Miss Victoria's voice. 
TERRALL: Did she say how the weather was in Paris? That's where she is, Mollie. 
MOLLIE: Well, I know that, sir, but I heard her speaking. 
TERRALL: Where? 
MOLLIE: I was walking past the big fireplace in the hall, sir, and her voice sort of floated out of it. 
TERRALL: Will you explain how you could possibly hear Miss Waterfield's voice when she's in Paris? 
MOLLIE: I know it can't be, sir, but I heard her as plain as anything. 
TERRALL: Anyway, what were you doing in the hall? 
MOLLIE: Oh, well. I wasn't doing anything wrong, sir. 
TERRALL: What were you doing in this part of the house at this hour? 
MOLLIE: Oh, I don't know. 
TERRALL: You do know, and you'll tell me! 
(Ruth is in the doorway.) 
RUTH: Arthur! 
TERRALL: I found this child creeping about the corridors. 
MOLLIE: I haven't done anything. 
TERRALL: Be quiet! 
MOLLIE: Yes, sir. 
TERRALL: She is miles from her room. Should have been in bed an hour since. 
RUTH: Did you have extra work, Mollie? 
MOLLIE: Yes, Miss Ruth. I did. 
TERRALL: You're a liar! 
MOLLIE: Well, I haven't done anything, Miss. I haven't took nothing. 
RUTH: Arthur, the poor child's frightened out of her senses. 
TERRALL: It's nothing but play acting. She's a mean, snivelling little minx. 
MOLLIE: But I haven't done anything, miss. 
TERRALL: Go to the sitting room and wait there. Mister Maxtible will decide what to do with you. 
MOLLIE: But sir, I 
TERRALL: Do as you are told! 
RUTH: Mollie, it's all right. Everything will be all right. 
(Mollie leaves.) 
RUTH: Arthur, tell me what's wrong. 
TERRALL: Wrong? Why should something be wrong? 
RUTH: Has my father influenced you in some way? 
TERRALL: No, not your father. 
RUTH: Come away with me, please. I somehow feel if we delay, it'll be too late. 
TERRALL: I can't go. Not yet.

[Maxtible's laboratory]

MAXTIBLE: I have done everything you have asked me to. You wanted an agency here on Earth to plan and prepare things for you. I have been that agency. Will you please tell those who give you orders that I am getting tired of waiting. 
DALEK: Do you threaten the Daleks? 
MAXTIBLE: Oh, surely threatening is not necessary. We have a partnership, an understanding. 
DALEK: You have obeyed us. 
MAXTIBLE: You have a strange way of putting things. I prefer to say that you have asked for certain services, I have provided those services punctually and efficiently. Now you really must look to your side of the bargain. It is not beyond me to ruin the entire enterprise. 
(The Dalek knocks Maxtible down.) 
DALEK: Do not threaten! Obey! 
MAXTIBLE: Yes. Very well, I understand. 
DALEK: Obey the Daleks. 
MAXTIBLE: No, please. Please wait! The secret. The secret. You promised to give it to me. That is why I have done all this. 
DALEK: The Daleks know many secrets. You will learn the most important. 
(The Dalek goes into the mirrored room.) 
MAXTIBLE: I must not be frightened of them. It's just their way. They're different people. Alien. But they will tell me. Of course they will! 
RUTH: Father? 
MAXTIBLE: Ruth, I told you not to come in here. 
RUTH: I had to. 
MAXTIBLE: Under any circumstances. 
RUTH: Father, I simply had to. I heard you speaking to someone and there's no-one here. And Arthur is involved in some way. 
MAXTIBLE: Ah, Arthur. Yes. 
RUTH: Why has he become so changed? And Victoria Waterfield. Where is she? 
MAXTIBLE: My child, these are questions that I cannot answer. But, my dear, I will tell you one thing. One thing only, and then perhaps you may understand why there are secrets to be kept. You see this? 
RUTH: What is it? 
MAXTIBLE: A piece of ordinary metal. Of very little value, would you not say so? 
RUTH: I suppose so. 
MAXTIBLE: What does it weigh? A few pounds? Five, six, shall we say? For centuries now, men have searched for the greatest secret of all. Some say it was known to the ancient alchemists, some say that the secret never existed at all, but still the stories and the rumours, and the search goes on. 
RUTH: What secret? 
MAXTIBLE: The transmutation of metal into gold. Changing metal into gold. Now, perhaps, do you begin to understand a little? To possess such a secret would mean power and influence beyond all imagination. And I am about to discover this secret. Nothing will stop me. Nothing! Nobody!

[Banqueting hall]

(Victoria comes out onto the gallery again.) 
DALEK: Name? 
VICTORIA: Victoria. 
DALEK: Louder! 
VICTORIA: Victoria Waterfield! Victoria Waterfield! 
DALEK: Inspection is over. Return to your room. 
(Victoria leaves. Jamie and Kemel hold the rope between them and move forward. Kemel throws the mace into the far corner to distract the Dalek, then they run forward, using the rope to catapult it into the blazing fireplace.) 
JAMIE: Well, that's fixed that one. 
(Jamie and Kemel loop the rope over the railing of the gallery. Kemel holds the ends as Jamie climbs up.)

[Minstrel's gallery]

(Jamie ties off the rope and Kemel starts to climb. The wood begins to creak.) 
JAMIE: Look out, the rail's going to break. 
(Jamie grabs Kemel's hand and helps him to safely just before the railing breaks. Jamie taps on the door.) 
JAMIE: Miss Waterfield? Can you open the door? We've come to get you. 
(Below them, a Dalek enters the banqueting hall. Then the door opens, revealing a second Dalek.)

Episode Five

[Minstrel's gallery]

(Jamie and Kemel lasso the Dalek with the rope and catapult it through the broken railing. It crashes on the floor below and explodes.) 
JAMIE: Quick, before we see any more of those mechanical beasties.

[Lumber room]

VICTORIA: Kemel, my dear friend. 
JAMIE: Aye, he's a good friend, right enough, Miss Waterfield. 
VICTORIA: And you? 
JAMIE: Introductions in a moment, if you please. First, I'd like to make us a little bit more secure. Kemel, if we lash this bedstead across the door, it might just hold. Rope! That's it. We could do with a chest against it, I'm thinking. Another one on top, ay? Well now, they can't get in and we can't get out. So, where does that put us? Oh. Jamie McCrimmon. I, er, I came to give you this. 
(Jamie hands over the handkerchief.) 
[Trophy room]

(The Doctor pours himself a glass of wine.) 
DOCTOR: Are you sure you won't join me? 
TERRALL: No, I won't. I very rarely touch it. 
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. Well, something else, perhaps? 
TERRALL: No. Thank you. 
DOCTOR: I know. Let me ring for some food. Now, do join me? 
TERRALL: No! You seem determined to involve me. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I do, don't I? 
TERRALL: This is a large house. I prefer my own company. 
DOCTOR: Oh, how very unsociable. 
TERRALL: Yes, possibly. No doubt you will enjoy your libation in one of the other rooms. 
DOCTOR: Liba? Oh. No, thank you. I'm perfectly happy here, thank you. I'm perfectly happy. 
(The Doctor inspects the glass cases around the walls.) 
DOCTOR: What an extraordinary collection, isn't it? 
(Terrall takes a sword from the wall.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm so sorry. You didn't, you weren't in the mood for talking, were you? 
TERRALL: Shouldn't you be helping Waterfield and Maxtible with their experiment? 
DOCTOR: Yes, but I thought I'd have a little rest. I wanted to talk to you. 
TERRALL: About what, pray? 
DOCTOR: About you, Mister Terrall. You interest me. Do you know something? Ever since I came to this house, I, why, this is Circassian, surely. 
TERRALL: Do I know what? 
DOCTOR: Circassian. Ever since I came to this house, I have never seen you eat or drink anything. Now, that's curious, isn't it? 
TERRALL: I dine alone. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'd thought of that. But Waterfield has never seen you eat or drink either. 
TERRALL: You seem to be a devotee of Edgar Allen Poe. 
DOCTOR: Oh, do I? 
TERRALL: However it isn't wise to make assumptions. 
(Terrall gestures at the Doctor with the sword.) 
TERRALL: Nor to meddle in affairs which are none of your business. 
DOCTOR: Touché. Oh, look. 
(Terrall rests the sword on a sideboard as the Doctor holds out his metal cup towards it.) 
DOCTOR: A perfectly ordinary sword, and yet it appears to be magnetic. And see. Directly you let go it loses its magnetism. Now, if I didn't know better, Mister Terrall, I'd say that you were full of some sort of electricity. 
WATERFIELD: Doctor? Excuse me. You're wanted. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Excuse me. 
TERRALL: Doctor. No doubt you're a keen student of human nature, but some things are better left alone. 
DOCTOR: No, Mister Terrall, I am not a student of human nature. I am a professor of a far wider academy, of which human nature is merely a part. All forms of life interest me. 
WATERFIELD: I'm sorry to interrupt you Doctor, but it's something rather urgent. 
(The Doctor follows Waterfield from the room. Terrall pours himself a glass of wine, but before he can take a sip, he has another of his attacks.) 
VOICE [OC]: Obey, obey, obey! 
(Terrell falls to his knees, clutching his head in agony.)

[Lumber room]

JAMIE: And so the Doctor and I were brought to the house. 
VICTORIA: Why did you risk your life to try and rescue me? 
JAMIE: Would you like some more water? 
VICTORIA: You are too modest. It was a silly question. 
JAMIE: Tell me, how did they come to capture you in the first place? 
VICTORIA: I don't remember. And yet, I seem to remember in the back of my mind, somebody, oh, I can't recall who it was, telling me to walk. And I obeyed, blindly and without interest. 
JAMIE: Aye. You were drugged, maybe? 
VICTORIA: I simply don't know. The only thing I remember is waking up in a bare room with one of those terrible, terrible things. 
JAMIE: Well, what do you remember before that, apart from this hazy recollection? 
VICTORIA: I was reading in the sitting room, but I couldn't concentrate because I was so worried about Papa. I think I fell asleep over my book. 
JAMIE: You see, how you came under the power of the Daleks is very important. They can't have done as much as they have without some help. 
VICTORIA: Help? From somebody in the house? 
JAMIE: Yes, from someone who wants their plans to succeed. Someone who drugged you or found a way of putting you under the power of the Daleks. 
VICTORIA: But how? How could it be done without my knowing?

[Trophy room]

(Maxtible is sitting in a wing chair, with Mollie standing in front of him staring vacantly ahead. Terrall is watching from across the room as Maxtible swings a jewelled fob watch in front of Mollie.) 
MAXTIBLE: You are paying attention, Mollie? 
MOLLIE: Yes, sir. 
MAXTIBLE: Then keep your eyes fixed on the jewel. See how the light catches it? Every facet sparkles, does it not? 
MOLLIE: Yes, sir. 
MAXTIBLE: Flashing, flashing, like a collection of sparks. But I know you are tired, Mollie. You are tired, are you not? Tell me. 
MOLLIE: I am tired. 
MAXTIBLE: Then close your eyes and sleep. You need have no fear, my child. A deep, heavy sleep. Oh, you are so exhausted. And now, in your sleep, you will hear only my voice. 
MOLLIE: Only your voice. 
MAXTIBLE: You have been dreaming, Mollie. Dreaming that there are mysteries in this house, that all is not well. You have dreamt that you heard the voice of Miss Waterfield. But it was all your imagination. It was nothing but a dream. Do you understand? 
MOLLIE: Nothing but a dream. 
MAXTIBLE: That is correct. Now, when I tell you to open your eyes, you will go back to your room and lie down on your bed. And when you awaken, the dream will fade and you will forget all your suspicions, for they might be injurious to your health. Now, open your eyes. 
(Mollie leaves.) 
TERRALL: An excellent subject. I'd no idea that mesmerism was one of your accomplishments. 
MAXTIBLE: How else do you suppose that I persuaded Victoria to go to the Daleks? 
TERRALL: I see. What of the experiment? 
MAXTIBLE: It progresses. 
TERRALL: Are you sure of the Doctor? 
MAXTIBLE: No, but he is watched. 
TERRALL: And Waterfield? 
MAXTIBLE: Waterfield's usefulness is nearing it's end. Your intervention in the stables was untimely. 
TERRALL: Maxtible, help me! 
MAXTIBLE: What do you mean? 
TERRALL: I seem to be in the grip of something. Sometimes my thoughts are clear, sometimes muddled. I don't know what's happened. Help me. 
MAXTIBLE: I can only help you if you obey me. 
TERRALL: But I obey our masters. 
MAXTIBLE: I prefer to call them our colleagues. It is their wish that you should obey me. 
TERRALL: You? But you would have killed Waterfield if they hadn't made me stop you. 
MAXTIBLE: A slight misunderstanding on the part of our friends. But now it is your turn to obey. I have a task for you to perform. 
(Maxtible touches a hidden switch and a panel opens in the wall, revealing a secret passageway.) 
MAXTIBLE: This entrance leads to the south wing of my house and to a certain room. You will fetch Victoria Waterfield and bring her to me. 
TERRALL: But, Maxtible. 
MAXTIBLE: Do as you are told! 
VOICE [OC]: Obey! Obey! Obey! 
MAXTIBLE: Well? 
TERRALL: I will bring Victoria to you.

[Maxtible's laboratory]

WATERFIELD: Is it finished? 
DOCTOR: Very nearly. Jamie was magnificent. But then I knew he would be. He produced a whole battery of emotions, each one of which is imprinted in here, see? 
(The Doctor holds up one of three glass capsules full of fine wiring.) 
WATERFIELD: The human factor? 
DOCTOR: Well, a part of it at least. The better part. Courage, pity, chivalry, friendship, even compassion. Some of the virtues. 
WATERFIELD: In there? 
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a positronic brain. We're going to implant one of these into each of these three Daleks here. The dormant ones. 
WATERFIELD: So the end is in sight? 
DOCTOR: Perhaps. 
WATERFIELD: What happens when the capsule comes into contact with the brain of the Dalek and starts to influence it? 
DOCTOR: Perhaps it'll drive them insane. 
WATERFIELD: Or turn them into super-beings? 
DOCTOR: Well, that is their purpose. At least, I imagine it is. I can't help feeling that there's more in this than meets the eye. 
DALEK: You have completed the experiment? 
DOCTOR: Yes, the three capsules are nearly ready. 
DALEK: Stand in front of the cabinet and speak when you have finished. 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. I understand. 
DALEK: Doctor, be careful. 
(The Dalek goes back into the mirrored room.) 
WATERFIELD: Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Hmm? 
WATERFIELD: You can't. You mustn't do it. 
DOCTOR: What do you mean? 
WATERFIELD: You must stop the experiment. 
DOCTOR: Oh, you should have thought of that some time ago. 
WATERFIELD: I know. 
DOCTOR: It's no use having a conscience now. 
WATERFIELD: But before it's too late. 
DOCTOR: It was too late when they took away your daughter. It was too late when you stole my Tardus and lured me to this house and this century. 
WATERFIELD: Yes, but what are we doing? What are we really doing? Turning these creatures into super-beings. 
DOCTOR: Homo superiense. 
WATERFIELD: Adding all that is best and finest in human nature to all that is brilliant and superior in them. They'll be unbeatable. 
DOCTOR: That is their purpose. 
WATERFIELD: But you're making over the whole world to them. Don't you realise that? Our world, our future. They will enslave us for all time. 
DOCTOR: That, Mister Waterfield, remains to be seen. 
(The Doctor turns back to his work. Waterfield sees the metal bar that Kemel bent and picks it up. The Doctor grabs his arm before he can strike.) 
DOCTOR: Attacking me will do no good. Now listen. You've done all of this because of your daughter. Jamie is with her now and they're both still in the power of the Daleks. They must be set free! 
WATERFIELD: And sacrifice a whole world. A history, past, present and future? Destroy an entire race? 
DOCTOR: Yes. I don't think you quite realise what you're saying. But yes, it may come to that. It may very well come to that.

[Lumber room]

JAMIE: So, with the Dalek's eye stick pointing forward, Kemel and I were able to tiptoe up behind him, throw the rope over his head and throw him into the fire. 
(Kemel gestures at the packing cases barricading the door. Liquid is coming in underneath them.) 
VICTORIA: What are they doing? 
JAMIE: They must be trying to get through. You'd better stand back, Miss Waterfield. 
VICTORIA: Why not break the door down? They're strong enough. 
JAMIE: I don't know. Maybe they want us alive. I just don't know. Is it hot? Aye, well, there's no smoke. It could be one of their newfangled inventions trying to melt their way through. Look, you'd better stand right back. Why didn't they try before this, is what I don't understand. Anyway, we'll make it as hard for them as we possibly can. Come on, Kemel. Excuse me. Take this. That's it. That one too. 
(The men pile more boxes around the door. A panel in the wall slides open behind Victoria and Terrell enters.) 
JAMIE: What's puzzling me is, there were two on the way up here, and there was a Dalek up here. And you were up 
(Terrell pulls Victoria into the secret passage and the door closes.) 
JAMIE: Hey, Miss Waterfield! 
VICTORIA [OC]: Jamie! 
JAMIE: Hey, did you hear it? Of course! Why didn't I use my head? There's another way in and out of here. Come on! 
(Jamie searches for the opening switch as the barricade begins to crumble. They open the panel and escape just before the Daleks break in.)

[Secret passage]

(At the trophy room door, Victoria frees herself while Terrell tries to open it. Meanwhile, further back along the passage.) 
JAMIE: Oh, no. Two ways to go. Kemel, you go that way. If it's a dead end, follow me. 
(Terrell hears someone approaching, and goes into the trophy room. Jamie sees a slip of light coming from under the door. He searches for the switch.)

[Trophy room]

(Jamie pauses to get used to the bright light again. Terrall attacks him with a sword, and misses. Jamie dodges his blade and gets his own sword from the far wall. They fence, and are evenly matched. Jamie finally corners Terrell.) 
JAMIE: Right. Where's Victoria Waterfield? 
TERRALL: You'll never find her. 
JAMIE: Tell me! 
TERRALL Never! 
(Jamie continues the fight. Ruth and Mollie appear in the doorway.) 
RUTH: Mollie, go and fetch the Doctor. Quick, hurry! 
MOLLIE: Yes, mistress. 
RUTH: Arthur! Stop it. I implore you. Stop it. 
TERRALL: Leave me! 
RUTH: Please, I implore you. Stop it! 
(Terrall suddenly drops his sword and falls to his knees, clutching his head in agony.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, what have you done? 
JAMIE: But I can't understand it. He just collapsed. 
RUTH: Arthur, are you all right? What's happened to him? 
DOCTOR: Do you want to save this man's life? 
RUTH: What do you mean? 
DOCTOR: Do you? 
RUTH: Yes! 
DOCTOR: Then take him away from here. As far away as possible. Go and get the carriage round to the stables. You go too, Mollie. We'll bring him out you. Now go along. 
RUTH: But, Doctor Oh, Mollie. 
(The Doctor finds a slim black box inside Terrell's jacket.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, I thought he was under some sort of control. Come along. 
TERRALL: The creatures. 
DOCTOR: Yes, don't worry about them. 
TERRALL: There's danger, I tell you. Some kind of danger. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I know there's danger. You must leave here immediately. 
TERRALL: The house, the creatures abroad. 
DOCTOR: Now you leave them to us. Take Ruth Maxtible with you. She's waiting for you at the stables. 
TERRALL: Yes, very well. 
JAMIE: Can you manage? 
TERRALL: Yes, I think so. Wait. There's something at the back of my mind. Victoria Waterfield. I feel I've harmed her in some way. 
DOCTOR: Victoria is safe and well. 
TERRALL: You You're positive? 
DOCTOR: I'm positive. Now we'll take care of her. You must leave immediately. 
TERRALL: Yes, if that's what you want. I'll find Ruth by the stables? 
DOCTOR: Yes! 
TERRALL: Yes. 
(Terrall leaves.) 
JAMIE: Well, that's fine for Ruth Maxtible, but you lied about Victoria. 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, and we must turn that lie into a truth.

[Maxtible's laboratory]

(Kemel's passageway brings him out at the top of the spiral stairs that lead down to the laboratory. Victoria is lying unconscious in front of the mirror room. Kemel kneels next to her.) 
DALEK: Turn around. Pick up the human female. Obey. Obey! Hurry! Hurry! Move into the cabinet. Obey! Move! 
(Kemel carries Victoria inside and the Dalek follows. After a while, the Doctor, Jamie and Waterfield enter.) 
DOCTOR: Well, Jamie, the experiment's nearly over. I've had no sleep. I've been up all night, but it's been worth it. 
JAMIE: Och, don't touch me! 
DOCTOR: Oh, now what's the matter? 
JAMIE: Anyone would think this was a little game. 
DOCTOR: No it is not a game. 
JAMIE: Of course it isn't, Doctor. People have died. The Daleks are all over the place, fit to murder the lot of us, and all you can say is you've had a good night's work. 
DOCTOR: Jamie. 
JAMIE: No, Doctor. Look, I'm telling you this. You and me, we're finished. You're just too callous for me. Anything goes by the board. Anything at all. 
DOCTOR: That's just not true, Jamie. I've never held that the end justifies the means. 
JAMIE: Och, words. What do I care about words? You don't give that much for a living soul except yourself. 
DOCTOR: I care about life. I care about human beings. Do you think I let you go through that Dalek test lightly? 
JAMIE: I don't know. Did you? Look, Doctor, just whose side are you on? 
(Three Daleks come from the packing cases.) 
DOCTOR: It's all right, Jamie. They're friends. 
JAMIE: Friends? 
DOCTOR: Now don't get the wrong idea. They are the experiment. 
(The Daleks gather round a swivel chair and play at pushing it. Maxtible enters and likes what he sees.) 
MAXTIBLE: Every feeling, every thought impulse you had during your attempt to rescue Victoria Waterfield, was recorded and made into a small positronic brain and added to these Daleks. The human factor to add to their own powers, to triumph over human beings. 
JAMIE: Well, how do you know they haven't succeeded? 
DOCTOR: Because human beings, Jamie, no matter how brilliant they may be, are always within reach of other human beings. Now then, it's all right, Jamie, don't worry. 
JAMIE: How do you know you can trust them, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: What is it? 
(The Daleks close in on the Doctor, pushing him towards the chair. He sits.) 
DOCTOR: What do you want? Hmm? What are you up to? Ah! What are you doing? 
JAMIE: Doctor, where are they taking you? 
DOCTOR: Where are you taking me? 
(The Daleks push the chair around the room.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, they're taking me for a ride! Jamie, they're playing a game. It's a game! They're taking me for a ride! 
MAXTIBLE: A rather amusing little game, don't you think, Jamie?

Episode Six

[Maxtible's laboratory]

DOCTOR: We've done it! Maxtible, they've got the human factor. We've done it! What are they doing now? Look, they're all joining in. They're playing train! 
(The Doctor blows on his recorder.) 
DALEKS: Trains, trains, trains, trains. 
DOCTOR: Oh! Oh, now what is it? Oh, we're on a roundabout. They're playing roundabout. Oh, I'm getting dizzy. Oh, dear. Oh, I'm dizzy! Oh, I'm dizzy. 
DALEKS: Diz-zy, diz-zy, dizzy, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Maxtible, do you hear that? They've got a sense of humour. 
MAXTIBLE: I'm glad you are so easily amused. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
MAXTIBLE: Well, I congratulate you, Doctor. They are almost human. 
DOCTOR: They are. 
MAXTIBLE: And I will now leave you to your little games. 
(Maxtible leaves.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. 
JAMIE: Well, how old are they now, Doctor, mentally? 
DOCTOR: Oh, they're just young children, but they'll grow up very fast. Within a matter of hours. Now, come here, all of you. Come along, gather round. Come here. Now then, come along, come along. 
DALEK: Who is this? 
DOCTOR: Oh, this is Jamie. He's a friend. 
DALEK: Friend. Hello, friend. 
DOCTOR: Well say hello, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Hello. 
DOCTOR: You know what a friend is, don't you? It's somebody who likes you, who wants to help you and share with you. 
(The Doctor has been scratching a greek letter on the base of each Dalek.) 
DOCTOR: There we are. 
DALEK: What have you done? 
DOCTOR: I have given you all names. Alpha, Beta and Omega. 
OMEGA: Alpha. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ALPHA: Beta. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
BETA: Omega. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
OMEGA: Alpha. 
ALPHA: Beta. 
BETA: Omega. 
OMEGA: Alpha. 
ALPHA: Beta. 
BETA: Omega. 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes. Now, this is Jamie and I am Doctor. We are friends. 
OMEGA: Friends, friends. 
ALPHA: Jamie, Doctor. 
DALEKS: Friends, friends. 
OMEGA: We must go now. We are called. 
DOCTOR: Go? Called? Go where? What do you mean, go? 
OMEGA: All Daleks are ordered to return to Skaro. 
DOCTOR: Return to Skaro? But that's the Dalek plan. 
OMEGA: Friend. 
JAMIE: But if the Daleks are returning to Skaro, where's Victoria? 
DOCTOR: Victoria! We left her in the secret passage. Come along, follow me! (The Doctor and Jamie run up the spiral staircase. Maxtible and Waterfield enter.) 
MAXTIBLE: I assure you, my dear Waterfield, Victoria is perfectly safe. 
WATERFIELD: But where is she? 
MAXTIBLE: The Daleks have released her. 
WATERFIELD: Released her? 
MAXTIBLE: Yes, yes, yes, yes. 
WATERFIELD: Well then, where is she now? 
MAXTIBLE: She's probably lying down. Ruth will be taking care of her, you may be sure of that. 
WATERFIELD: Not Ruth, no. I saw her and Mollie helping Arthur Terrall into a dog-cart not half an hour since. 
MAXTIBLE: Ruth and Terrall? 
WATERFIELD: Yes. Surely you knew they were leaving? 
MAXTIBLE: Oh, yes, yes, indeed, yes. It slipped my memory. You see, I'm going for a little trip myself. No doubt, I shall join them. Well, possibly she's taking a stroll in the garden. Go along and see. Go along and see. 
WATERFIELD: Yes. 
MAXTIBLE: Well, go along, man! Go along and see. Find your Victoria. 
(Waterfield leaves.) 
MAXTIBLE: Stupid, stupid girl. 
(Maxtible takes a travelling bag from a cupboard. He notices a small grey box on the floor. It is fastened down securely, so he open it to see a complicated mechanism.) 
DALEK: What are you doing? 
MAXTIBLE: Merely looking. 
DALEK: Do not touch the instrument. 
MAXTIBLE: What is that box for? 
DALEK: Do not question. You have your orders. 
MAXTIBLE: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. To bring the Doctor and his companion to you here for our little trip. 
DALEK: Yes. 
MAXTIBLE: And then the secret. You will give it to me? 
DALEK: Yes. 
MAXTIBLE: The formula. The transmutation formula. 
DALEK: Yes. Obey your order. Do not delay. 
(The Dalek leaves. Waterfield watches Maxtible from the doorway as he returns to the box on the floor. It seems to contain a timing device.) 
MAXTIBLE: Doctor? Doctor? Doctor? Oh, Waterfield, how I'm delighted you've come back. Now will you please go and find the Doctor and his companion Jamie, and bring them here to me. It is a matter of some urgency. 
WATERFIELD: Maxtible? 
MAXTIBLE: Oh, what is it? 
WATERFIELD: What have you arranged with the Daleks? 
MAXTIBLE: The Daleks? Nothing. 
WATERFIELD: What formula did they promise you? 
MAXTIBLE: No formula whatever. 
WATERFIELD: What are you doing? You've sold yourself to them, haven't you? 
MAXTIBLE: You fool! 
WATERFIELD: Yes, I'm a fool. A fool not to have realised before that it was you who brought all this misery down on us. 
MAXTIBLE: You never did understand anything, did you? Well, metal into gold. That's what the Daleks are going to give me. Now do you begin to understand? The secret of the transmutation of metal into gold. 
WATERFIELD: Do you imagine I care about that? Where's Victoria? 
MAXTIBLE: I have not the remotest idea. 
WATERFIELD: Yes, you have, and you're going to tell me! Where is my daughter? 
MAXTIBLE: Get your hands off me. Let go of me! Murder! Murder! Murder! Murder! Murder! Murder! Murder! Murder! Oh. 
(Maxtible smashes a rack of test tubes against Waterfield's head, knocking him down. A Dalek comes out of the mirror room and adjusts the control in the grey box.) 
MAXTIBLE: Oh, what are you doing? 
DALEK: Where is the Doctor? 
MAXTIBLE: Well, I had no time to bring him. 
DALEK: Hurry. That is an order. 
MAXTIBLE: What is that box for? Will you tell me? 
DALEK: We are destroying this area. 
MAXTIBLE: But you can't do that. Turn it off! You cannot destroy my house! 
DALEK: Bring the Doctor. Obey! Immediately! 
MAXTIBLE: But, the secret. If you destroy my laboratory, the secret is useless. You promised me. They must be out of their minds. Destroy my laboratory? The very idea. Well, well, but, oh goodness gracious me, only two minutes. Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Oh, you fool. Doctor! Doctor! 
(Maxtible grabs his bag and runs into the mirror room. Waterfield sits up. Other Daleks return from the rest of the house.) 
DALEK: All Daleks return to Skaro. 
DALEK 2: All Daleks return to Skaro. 
DALEK: And the prisoners? 
DALEK 2: They are already in transit. 
(The Daleks go into the mirror room. Waterfield stands as Jamie and the Doctor enter.) 
WATERFIELD: Dalek. Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Waterfield, what's happened to you? 
WATERFIELD: Doctor. Daleks going to destroy house. Can't turn it off. 
DOCTOR: But this is a time switch. 
JAMIE: Well, if you can't turn it off, surely 
DOCTOR: No, wait a minute. Eighty nine, eighty eight, eighty seven. Just about a minute, that's all we've got. 
JAMIE: Well, toss it out the window then. 
DOCTOR: This isn't a firework. We'd have to toss this half a mile. We'll have to follow the Daleks to Skaro. Jamie, open the doors. Come along. 
WATERFIELD: Doctor, Doctor. 
JAMIE: Doctor, they're locked. They won't budge! 
WATERFIELD: Cupboard in the alcove. The time machine. 
DOCTOR: Time machine? Jamie, give me a hand. Quickly. 
(The Doctor and Jamie go to the cupboard and pull out the two sections of the transmat from the antique shop.)
DOCTOR: Now the other one. Steady. 
(They set them up and the Doctor tries to set the controls.) JAMIE: Right. Now, where's Victoria? 
DOCTOR: Quick, Jamie, the time switch. 
JAMIE: Twenty eight, Doctor. Hey, Doctor, Kemel must have dropped this. 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
(It's the pressed flower.) 
JAMIE: We'll find Victoria, and Kemel too. 
(The Doctor and Jamie help Waterfield to the time machine and they fade away as the countdown hits zero. KaBOOM!)

[Skaro cell]

(Victoria is imprisoned again, in a plain cell with Kemel.) 
VICTORIA: Dear Kemel. Are any of the others here? 
(Kemel shakes his head.) 
VICTORIA: The Daleks? 
(Kemel nods. A Dalek enters with Maxtible.) 
DALEK: You will wait here. 
VICTORIA: Oh, Mister Maxtible. 
MAXTIBLE: What are you doing here? 
VICTORIA: Don't know. Nor even where here may be. 
MAXTIBLE: Oh, we've been transported to the Dalek planet, my dear. To Skaro. 
VICTORIA: I don't understand you. 
MAXTIBLE: A little journey through space. 
VICTORIA: They're taken us somewhere. Is that what you mean? Away from your house? 
MAXTIBLE: Oh, far away. Far, far away. 
VICTORIA: But why? What do they want? 
MAXTIBLE: I know why I am here. But why you are here I have not the faintest idea. 
VICTORIA: You seem to understand them. Ask them. 
MAXTIBLE: Don't be foolish girl. I shall do no such thing. 
VICTORIA: And where's my father? 
MAXTIBLE: I do not know. I am not a nursemaid to your father. 
DALEK: Follow me. 
MAXTIBLE: Of course, I shall do my best for you, but the matter is really entirely out of my hands. 
(Maxtible leaves.) 
VICTORIA: It's no good. He won't help us. Don't worry, Kemel. I shall protect you. I shall see they do you no harm. Yes, I suppose it was a bit silly. (Kemel shakes his head and flexes his muscles.) 
VICTORIA: You think so? I wish I did. Oh well, maybe between us we can fight them. We must face it out together.

[Skaro desert]

(The Doctor, Jamie and Waterfield are sheltering in a rocky outcrop.) 
WATERFIELD: And that is the Dalek city? 
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. 
JAMIE: I've scouted around, but I can't see any water. 
WATERFIELD: Oh, please don't bother. I feel much better. 
DOCTOR: Are you sure? 
WATERFIELD: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Come along, then. We must get along. 
JAMIE: You mean just walk into the city? 
DOCTOR: Oh, no. The city is all around us. At least, it's beneath us. Come along. 
(The Doctor takes them to a tunnel mouth in the rock face.) 
JAMIE: How long have you known that's there? 
DOCTOR: Not a sound. I think the Daleks are in for a little surprise.

[Skaro corridor]

BLACK: Where is the Doctor? 
MAXTIBLE: I had no time to get him. 
BLACK: No time? 
MAXTIBLE: I was told my house was going to be destroyed. Why? 
BLACK: You did not bring the Doctor? 
MAXTIBLE: Everything I possess is in that house. Everything. What right had you or anyone to destroy it? 
BLACK: Right? 
MAXTIBLE: All these years of labour, all these years of research, destroyed through this caprice of yours. My laboratory, the only real thing in the whole of my existence, destroyed. I, Theodore Maxtible, made a bargain with you, and I demand to know. Ah! ah! 
BLACK: You have disobeyed a Dalek command. You must obey the Dalek command. 
DALEKS: Exterminate. Destroy. 
MAXTIBLE: It's not my fault. I swear it's not my fault. I No! 
(An alarm sounds. The Black Dalek leaves.) 
DALEK 2: Move. 
MAXTIBLE: What is happening? What are you going to do with me? 
DALEK 2: Obey. Move.

[Skaro cell]

(A grey then a black Dalek enter.) 
GREY: These humans are still here. 
BLACK: Then other humans are inside the city. (The Daleks leave.) 
VICTORIA: Other humans inside the city, Kemel. Listen! 
DALEK [OC]: Emergency. Emergency. Human beings detected in city. Emergency! Emergency! 
VICTORIA: Maybe it's Jamie and the Doctor. Oh, Kemel, there's a chance. A chance. 
DALEK [OC]: Intruders detected. Emergency! Emergency! Human beings detected in city. Emergency! Emergency! Intruders detected. All Daleks to observation stations. Repeat. All Daleks to observation stations. Emergency! 
(The humans come out of a tunnel into a huge canyon. They have to sidle along a narrow ledge.)

[Skaro corridor]

BLACK: Stop! What is that mark? 
OMEGA: That is my name. 
BLACK: Name? 
OMEGA: The Doctor gave it to me. 
DALEK: Doctor? 
OMEGA: Yes. He is my friend. 
DALEK: Follow me. 
(The two Daleks move on, and shortly afterwards Kemel and Victoria are escorted along.)

[outside the Control room]

(The control room is in darkness.) 
DALEK: Remain here. 
MAXTIBLE: What is happening? Do you know? They say there are other human beings in the city. 
VICTORIA: No. No, thank you. Why don't you answer me. You little fool! 
(Maxtible lunges at Victoria and Kemel intervenes.) 
MAXTIBLE: No one can help you here. No one but me. 
DALEK: Silence. Follow me. You, wait. 
MAXTIBLE: I can't see anything. 
DALEK: Move! 
MAXTIBLE: Where are you taking me? 
(The Dalek takes Maxtible into the dark room. Maxtible screams.) 
VICTORIA: Oh, what are they doing to him? 
DALEK: You follow. You will wait. 
VICTORIA: I will do as you say. 
DALEK: Move forward. Alone.

[Underground tunnel]

(Below the control room somewhere.) 
JAMIE: That was a human voice, I tell you. 
DOCTOR: Perhaps it was, Jamie. 
WATERFIELD: We must go more quickly. 
(Victoria screams.) 
JAMIE: Victoria! 
DOCTOR: No, you mustn't. 
JAMIE: That was Victoria's voice. 
DOCTOR: You can't. You'll go over the edge! 
DALEK: Doctor, I am your friend. 
JAMIE: One of your experiments, Doctor. For a moment I thought we were done for. 
DOCTOR: What is your name? 
DALEK: Omega. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. 
DALEK: I have come to lead you. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
(The Doctor slips on the ledge.) 
JAMIE: Careful! 
(The Doctor sees the mark on the Dalek, and gets up.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm all right, thank you. Lead on. 
DALEK: Follow me. 
(The Doctor dodges ahead of the Dalek.) 
DOCTOR: What was that screaming? 
DALEK: A prisoner. 
DOCTOR: Where? 
DALEK: Follow me. I will show you. 
(The Doctor flattens himself against the rock so the Dalek can pass.) 
JAMIE: What are you doing? 
(The Doctor pushes the Dalek off the ledge into the chasm.) 
DOCTOR: Think I don't know my own mark? That wasn't the real Omega at all. 
JAMIE: Up to all sorts of tricks, aren't they? 
WATERFIELD: Oh, please. We must reach my daughter.

[Skaro cell]

MAXTIBLE: I tell you, they forced me. They threatened to kill us all. First of all, they ordered me to scream and I was to make you do the same. 
VICTORIA: And you had to do as you were told? 
MAXTIBLE: I tell you, they threatened to kill me. 
VICTORIA: You came up behind me in the dark and twisted my arm. 
MAXTIBLE: And what else could I do? 
VICTORIA: Oh, if only I'd realised. Why do you think they wanted us to scream like that? 
MAXTIBLE: I've no idea. 
VICTORIA: You know perfectly well. There are other people in the city. They wanted to draw them on, trap them. Oh, if only I could have thought quickly. Oh, Kemel. 
(The intruders climb out of a ventilation grille and walk along the corridor. A Dalek watches them go.)

[Outside the control room]

DOCTOR: No. No, I don't like the look of this. Back the way we came. 
(Two Daleks block their way.) 
BLACK: Follow me.

[Control room]

(They follow the Black into the control room which gradually lights up. A big Dalek is seated on a dais and connected to its surrounding by lots of tubes.) 
EMPEROR: Doctor! 
JAMIE: Look at the size of that thing. 
EMPEROR: So, you are the Doctor. 
DOCTOR: We meet at last. I wondered if we ever would. 
EMPEROR: The experiment is over. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I have implanted the human factor in the three Daleks that you gave me. When I say run, run! 
EMPEROR: Speak louder. 
DOCTOR: Promise me, Jamie. I was merely telling my friend that the day of the Daleks is coming to an end. 
EMPEROR: Explain. 
DOCTOR: It's very simple. Somewhere in the Dalek race there are three Daleks with the human factor. Gradually, they will come to question. They will persuade other Daleks to question. You will have a rebellion on your planet! 
EMPEROR: No. 
DOCTOR: I say yes. I've beaten you and I don't care what you do to me now. 
EMPEROR: Silence. The human factor showed us what the Dalek factor was. 
DOCTOR: What? 
JAMIE: What does that mean? 
EMPEROR: Without knowing, you have shown the Daleks what their own strength is. 
WATERFIELD: While you were doing one thing, they were really making you do another. 
EMPEROR: The human factor is useless. 
DOCTOR: You still have those three Daleks to contend with. 
EMPEROR: They will be impregnated with the Dalek factor. Your discovery, but your work is not over. 
DOCTOR: I won't work for you. 
EMPEROR: You will obey! 
JAMIE: What is the Dalek factor? 
DOCTOR: You want me to guess? It means to obey, to fight, to destroy, to exterminate. I won't do it. 
EMPEROR: Watch! 
(An alcove lights up to reveal...) 
JAMIE: The Tardis, Doctor! 
EMPEROR: You will take the Dalek factor. You will spread it to the entire history of Earth!

Episode Seven

[Control room]

DOCTOR: No. You can't make me do it. You can't. 
EMPEROR: You will obey! 
BLACK: Move! 
EMPEROR: Doctor, you will obey.

[Weapons room]

(A large glass container full of an opaque liquid is suspended over a second empty container and linked to it by a mass of tubes and wires. There is a digital display panel.) 
DALEK: Experiment ready. 
BLACK: Proceed. 
(The machine is switched on, and starts humming.)

[Skaro cell]

MAXTIBLE: Transmutation of metal into gold. 
JAMIE: You mean to say he's worked against us all just for that? 
DOCTOR: People have done worse for less, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Look, it's daft though. Metal into gold's an old wives tale. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. The alchemists of the Middle Ages made transmutation their main aim in life. 
JAMIE: Ah, they didn't succeed though. 
DOCTOR: Even in the twentieth century, it's still considered scientifically possible. 
MAXTIBLE: Of course it's possible. 
JAMIE: Oh, well, I don't care whether it's possible or not. 
DOCTOR: Whether it is or whether it isn't is beside the point. 
JAMIE: Oh, and what is the point then? 
DOCTOR: Why are the Daleks doing this? 
MAXTIBLE: They promised me! 
DOCTOR: Daleks don't keep their promises. 
MAXTIBLE: I see what you're trying to do, Doctor. You're trying to shake my faith. But I will be given the secret. 
JAMIE: Ah, well it won't do you any good because you won't be able to use your secret. I'll see to that. 
MAXTIBLE: You'll do no such thing! 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
DALEK: Move away! Move! 
VICTORIA: Please, Jamie, do as it says. 
DALEK: You will not harm this human being or you will be exterminated. 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. We quite understand. 
MAXTIBLE: You will be advised to do as they say. 
JAMIE: Oh, don't worry. The very thought of going near you revolts me. 
WATERFIELD: Mister McCrimmon. 
(The Dalek leaves. The Doctor plays his recorder.) 
WATERFIELD: They seem to be prepared to protect you. 
MAXTIBLE: Be warned. 
WATERFIELD: I appeal to you, Maxtible. It may still not be too late. If they're your friends, help us. If you did, we could plan something. Try to escape. 
MAXTIBLE: No! 
WATERFIELD: Well at least for Victoria's sake, after what you did to her. 
MAXTIBLE: No, I tell you! No! 
VICTORIA: It's no good, Papa. He doesn't listen any more. What are you thinking? 
DOCTOR: I'm trying to puzzle out a problem, Victoria. The Daleks say I'm going to do something for them. Something I would rather die than do. 
MAXTIBLE: Plus or minus point oh oh three. Plus or minus. 
VICTORIA: Perhaps they think you're like him. 
DOCTOR: Oh, no. The Daleks know me well enough by this time. 
VICTORIA: They intend to persuade you then. 
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, it isn't that either. You see, there isn't a persuasion strong enough. Not even the offer of all the lives in this room. 
VICTORIA: I see. 
DOCTOR: Five lives against a whole planet? Well, it's not a choice, is it? 
VICTORIA: No. 
DOCTOR: Even if I could trust the Daleks, even if they set us free, we still couldn't go back to Earth. I suppose I might try and take you all to another universe. I might even try and take you to my own planet. 
VICTORIA: Your own? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I live a long, long way away from Earth. Oh, just a minute. Maxtible! Arthur Terrall! The Daleks put some sort of control device on him. 
MAXTIBLE: What of it? It was erratic. I always warned the Daleks it would prove unsatisfactory. 
JAMIE: Aye. Well, it's a good thing for you it did fail. They'd have tried it on you next.

[Control room]

EMPEROR: Report! 
BLACK: The experiment is ready. 
EMPEROR: Proceed.

[Weapons room]

(Three Daleks are working on the equipment.) 
BLACK: Discontinue work. Discontinue work. Discontinue work. 
OMEGA: Why? 
BLACK DALEK: Who spoke? Who questioned a Dalek command? 
(The three Daleks line up by the machine.)

[Skaro cell]

BLACK: The secret of transmutated metal. 
MAXTIBLE: Yes. Yes, yes, the secret you promised me. 
BLACK: Turn and look. 
(A panel in the wall slides back to show the machine in the weapons room next door.) 
BLACK DALEK: Above, liquid metal. Read. 
MAXTIBLE: Wait. 
BLACK DALEK: Do not move! 
MAXTIBLE: It is hard to see. Fifty five point eight four. 
BLACK: Atomic weight. Read again. 
MAXTIBLE: Seven point eight four. 
BLACK: Specific gravity. 
DOCTOR: Atomic weight and gravity of iron. 
BLACK: Watch. Read atomic weight. 
MAXTIBLE: Nineteen point two. 
BLACK: Read specific gravity. 
MAXTIBLE: Sixty nine point five. Gold! Iron into gold! I told you it was possible. They've kept their promise. It's true, it's true! They have! 
BLACK: The machine is yours. 
MAXTIBLE: Yes. Ha, ha, ha. Yes, yes! 
DOCTOR: Maxtible, if you value your life, don't go near that machine! 
(Too late. Maxtible steps through the archway and is instantly paralysed.) 
JAMIE: Maxtible! 
(Lights play on his face.) 
VICTORIA: What have they done to him? 
BLACK: Turn. Move to control. 
MAXTIBLE: I obey. 
JAMIE: They've turned him into a Dalek. 
BLACK: Yes. The Dalek factor. 
DOCTOR: Is that what you want me to do to the people of Earth? 
BLACK: We know you will obey. 
(The Black Dalek leaves.) 
DOCTOR: Human beings into Daleks.

[Control Room]

BLACK: Emperor. 
EMPEROR: Speak! 
BLACK: A Dalek questioned an order. 
EMPEROR: Questioned? Then it was one of the test Daleks. 
BLACK: Yes. 
EMPEROR: Find it, immediately!

[Skaro cell]

(Nighttime, and Maxtible walks through the deserted weapons room. He adjusts a scanner box so it faces the door to the cell, then activates the door so the panel opens. Everyone is asleep. Maxtible goes to the Doctor and takes out his fob watch and starts swinging it.) 
MAXTIBLE: Doctor, open your eyes. You are asleep still but you can hear my voice. I have come to help you. Look at the box. 
(An image appears on the scanner.) 
MAXTIBLE: I have had your Tardis placed outside the city. I will take you to it. Rise, and follow me. 
(The Doctor gets up and goes towards the doorway.) 
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, what are you doing? Don't go near the door, Doctor! 
(The Doctor steps into the doorway and stands still as the lights flash for a few moments then stop.) 
JAMIE: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Stay where you are! That is an order! 
MAXTIBLE: We will work together on the Dalek factor. Follow me. 
DOCTOR: I obey.

[Weapons room]

(Maxtible and the Doctor walk to a large computer terminal.) 
MAXTIBLE: Stop. This machine is for the mass production of the Dalek factor. Follow me. 
(Maxtible holds up a small glass capsule.) 
MAXTIBLE: Stop. 
(He gestures to a second machine.) 
MAXTIBLE: This machine will transform the thought patterns in this capsule into a steam. The steam will be sprayed into the atmosphere of the Earth. 
DOCTOR: I must examine the machine. 
MAXTIBLE: Do so. 
(The DOCTOR bends over the equipment. Maxtible leaves the Doctor alone. Then the Doctor sneaks back to the doorway to the cell and opens a small panel. It contains a glass capsule which the Doctor removes and replaces with another from his pockets. He puts back the panel and has a good look around before going back to the closed door.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie. Jamie. Jamie! 
JAMIE: Yes? 
DOCTOR: Jamie, when I give you the word, bring everyone through this archway. Through the door. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: Trust me. 
BLACK: What are you doing? 
DOCTOR: Take me to your Emperor. 
BLACK: Wait. 
(The Black Dalek opens the doorway. The Doctor winks at Jamie, then the door shuts again.)

[Skaro cell]

VICTORIA: He walked through, just as though he was 
WATERFIELD: It must have affected him. We saw it happen. 
JAMIE: But you heard him speak normally just now. 
WATERFIELD: Another trap to make us walk though? 
JAMIE: Oh, they could push us through any time they liked. 
VICTORIA: Do you think there's a chance? Something to hope for? 
JAMIE: I don't know. Well, I don't understand. I mean, how do we know we can trust him?

[Control room]

EMPEROR: What do you want? 
DOCTOR: A Dalek questioned an order. 
EMPEROR: Again? 
MAXTIBLE: We have searched without success. 
DOCTOR: All Daleks must pass through the archway door. The Dalek with the human factor will then become a Dalek again. Will become as this human and I have become. 
EMPEROR: Let it be done! 
MAXTIBLE + DOCTOR: I obey. 
EMPEROR: You will deal with the human prisoners.

[Skaro cell]

(The door panel is opened and everyone watches a procession of Daleks pass through the archway and get the flashing light treatment before entering the weapons room.) DOCTOR: Go on, quickly. Through the door. Follow them through the door! Oh, it's all right. I've changed over the factors. I used one of the capsules from my test Dalek. I've given them all the human factor! Go on! Go on! 
JAMIE: Well, aren't you coming? 
DOCTOR: Well, I've got things to do. And I've been through already. 
JAMIE: Ah, well, why didn't it affect you then? 
DOCTOR: I don't come from Earth, Jamie. Now, down the corridor, turn to the left and find the tunnel. I'll join you there later. 
JAMIE: Oh well, here goes. It's all right, nothing happened! Come on! Come on, Kemel. Quick! 
WATERFIELD: Victoria, I must help the Doctor. 
JAMIE: Oh, don't be a fool, man. 
VICTORIA: Father, no. 
WATERFIELD: I must find Maxtible. He's to blame for all this. Take care of her. 
VICTORIA: But Father! 
JAMIE: Oh, he'll be all right, come on.

[Weapons room]

(A group of freshly humanised Daleks are twirling around and having fun as the party sneaks past.) i
DALEK: Oh, dizzy! 
DALEKS: Dizzy Daleks! 
DALEK: Dizzy, dizzy. 
DALEKS: Dizzy Daleks! 
(More Daleks come through the cell and get converted, then a Black Dalek arrives with Maxtible.)

[Skaro cell]

MAXTIBLE: Where are the prisoners? 
DALEK: I do not know. 
BLACK: Continue working. 
DALEK: Why? 
DALEK 2: Yes, why? 
BLACK: Do not question. 
DALEKS: Why? Why? Why? Why not question? Why?
BLACK: Silence! You will obey! 
DALEK: I will not obey. 
(The Black Dalek fires at the questioning Dalek, killing it.) 
BLACK: You will obey without question! 
(Two humanised Daleks fire at the Black, which bursts into flames.)

[Weapons room]

(The Doctor appears in the doorway.) 
DOCTOR: Quickly, this way. Follow me, Daleks! This way! Come on!

[outside the Control room]

BLACK: Return to your work. 
DALEK: Why? 
BLACK: Do not question. 
DOCTOR: Why not question? What work? Tell them. 
BLACK: Silence! 
DALEK: Explain. 
OMEGA: What work? 
DALEK: Why obey without question? 
DOCTOR: Ask the Emperor! 
OMEGA: The Emperor. 
DALEK: Yes, ask the Emperor. 
BLACK: Keep back, you cannot enter! 
DOCTOR: Why? 
DALEK: Why? 
OMEGA: Why? 
DALEK: The Emperor must explain. 
(The Black Dalek opens fire.) 
DOCTOR: Defend yourselves, Daleks! The Black Daleks are attacking you!

[Control room}

EMPEROR: All Black Dalek Leaders to Control. Exterminate all opposition! Destroy rebels!

[outside the Control room]

DOCTOR: Come on! This way! Come on! 
DALEK: I will obey. 
OMEGA: But not without question. 
DOCTOR: That's right. Question! 
WATERFIELD: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: The Black Daleks are attacking every man. 
WATERFIELD: Hurry, man! 
DOCTOR: The Emperor has commanded it. 
DALEK: Why? 
OMEGA: Why? 
DOCTOR: Because you question. Defend yourselves. Destroy the Emperor or be destroyed yourselves! 
WATERFIELD: Hurry. 
DOCTOR: Destroy the Emperor! 
WATERFIELD: We must go, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. I've finished now. 
(A Black Dalek appears. Waterfield pushes the Doctor aside and takes the full weapon hit. The friendly Daleks take revenge.) 
DOCTOR: Now lie still. I'll try and get help to you. 
WATERFIELD: No time for help. 
DOCTOR: You saved my life, didn't you. 
WATERFIELD: Yes. Good life to save. Please, you must. Victoria. 
DOCTOR: Don't worry about Victoria. We'll look after her. 
WATERFIELD: No time for me. 
(Waterfield dies. More friendly Daleks arrive.) 
DOCTOR: The Emperor has commanded your destruction! 
DALEKS: Why? Why? Why? 
DOCTOR: But your friends are fighting for you! 
DALEKS: Friends? 
DOCTOR: Down there. Help them. 
DALEKS: Friends.

[Control room]

DALEK [OC]: Exterminate. Annihilate. 
EMPEROR: Danger! This is your Emperor speaking! There is danger here! Obey me! Do not fight in here! Do not fight in here! I said, Obey! Obey! 
(The friendly Daleks break through the Black defence and rush in.) 
EMPEROR: Obey me! Obey me! Your Emperor is ordering you. You will not fight in here! You will not fight in here! Obey! I am your Emperor! Daleks, obey me! Obey! Obey! Obey! You will be exterminated! All exterminated. Annihilated! We will all be exterminated! Annihilated! 
(But the civil war intensifies.) 
EMPEROR: The Dalek race will die out completely! Obey your Emperor! Obey! 
(The weapons room explodes.)

[Underground tunnel]

(Making their way along the narrow ledge.) 
MAXTIBLE: Kemel! Come here! 
(Maxtible throws himself at his former servant.) 
MAXTIBLE: Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! 
(The Dalek Maxtible is strong and starts to throttle Kemel before throwing him down into the chasm.)

[Control room]

EMPEROR: Attention! Attention! Emergency! Emergency! All Daleks return to control immediately!

[Underground tunnel]

(Maxtible obeys, and leaves.) 
VICTORIA: Poor Kemel.

[Control room]

(The Doctor watches the chaos from the doorway. The Emperor is badly damaged, equipment is on fire, Daleks are screaming and dying. The Doctor goes to a ventilation shaft, missing meeting Maxtible coming back.) 
MAXTIBLE: The Daleks must not, cannot be destroyed. The race will survive! The Daleks will live and rule forever! 
(The Emperor's body collapses. The city falls apart in a series of explosions.)

[Skaro desert]

JAMIE: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, Jamie! 
JAMIE: A Dalek nearly caught us, but I tossed it over the edge. But, poor Kemel. 
DOCTOR: Kemel? 
JAMIE: Aye. You see, he was trying. 
VICTORIA: Where is my father? Is he dead? 
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I'm afraid he is. But he didn't die in vain. I think we've seen the end of the Daleks forever. Jamie, we must get along to the Tardis. It's over there. 
JAMIE: We can't leave her alone, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: We're not going to leave her. She's coming with us. The end. The final end.

[Control room]

DALEKS: Destroy! Destroy! Argh!

[Tardis]

(The Doctor and Victoria enter.) 
DOCTOR: There we are. Well, what do you think? 
VICTORIA: I don't know. I can't believe it. It's so big. Where are we? 
DOCTOR: Oh, it's the Tardis. It's my home. At least, it has been for a considerable number of years. 
VICTORIA: What are all these knobs? 
DOCTOR: What, these? 
JAMIE: Instruments. These are for controlling our flight. 
VICTORIA: Flight? 
JAMIE: Well, yes. You see, we travel around in here through time and space. 
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no, no. Don't laugh. It's true. Your father and Maxtible were working on the same problem, but I have perfected a rather special model, which enables me to travel through the universe of time. 
VICTORIA: How can you? I mean, if what you say is true then you must be, er, well, how old? 
DOCTOR: Well, if we count in Earth terms, I suppose I must be about four hundred, yes, about four hundred and fifty years old. Yes, well, quite. Now, I think Victoria might find that dress a little impracticable if she's going to join us in our adventures. Jamie, show her where she can find some new ones, will you? 
JAMIE: Aye, right. This way, Victoria. Try to give us a smooth take off, Doctor? We don't want to frighten her. 
(Jamie leaves.) 
DOCTOR: A smooth take off? A smooth take off! What a nerve! 
(The Tardis dematerialises.)

[Telos]

(A simple yet elegant curved space rocket sits on three spindly legs on the only flat piece of land available. It's only visible markings are a chequered pattern around it. Up on a nearby cliff, a there is a dark-skinned man.) 
PARRY [OC]: Hey, Toberman! Get that big head down! 
(The man walks to the edge of a cliff and looks down at the party in the gully.) 
PARRY: (bearded Welshman, gesturing at him) What's the matter with you? Have you gone mad? 
VINER: (balding man) The fool. Doesn't he realise the danger he's in? It's nothing to laugh at. None of us knows what's going to happen when we press that thing, especially in this rarified atmosphere. 
PARRY: All right. Viner, no need to get excited. (to the woman) Can't you keep your servant under control? 
KAFTAN: (Middle Eastern) If I wish, I can. 
HOPPER: (blond American) Hurry it up, will you, Rogers! I don't know what you think you're going to find anyway. 
PARRY: According to the map reference now, that should be the entrance to the city of Telos. 
HOPPER: I hope you're right, because I want to get out of here. 
KLIEG: (German, balding) Let me remind you, Mister Hopper, that you are being more than well paid for your part in this expedition. 
HOPPER: Oh, big deal. 
ROGERS: (younger man) Sorry. We had to make it a pretty big one. 
PARRY: All right, let's get on with it. We've wasted enough time. 
(The group scramble further up the cliff and take cover.) 
PARRY: Stand by. Everybody down! 
(The remote detonator is activated, and part of the opposite cliff face is blown away. The group comes out to look.) 
PARRY: Oh no. 
HOPPER: Well, there you go. You blast yourself one lump of rock and all you've got is another. 
(Professor Parry turns away in disgust, and Rogers looks again at the rock face.) 
ROGERS: No, wait a minute, look! 
(To the side of the area they blew up are is a clearly artificial opening in the cliff.) 
HOPPER: Man, you just blew yourself a pair of doors. 
(Cheers all round.) 
PARRY: Well, come on. What are we waiting for? 
(The team hurry up to the entrance, led by Toberman and Kaftan.)

[Outside the Tomb]

(The entrance is a recessed metallic structure with double doors in the middle. On either side are images of strange humanoid creatures with chest plates and helmets with handles.) 
KAFTAN: Fifty pounds for the first man to open the doors. 
PARRY: Miss Kaftan, I must remind you that I am the leader of this 
(An anonymous man walks up to the doors and takes a firm hold of the handles. He promptly gets electrocuted for his efforts.) 
PARRY: What happened? 
KLIEG: I don't know. 
HOPPER: Well, one thing for sure, he's not going to collect fifty pounds from you or anybody else. 
VINER: Quiet. Quiet a minute. 
PARRY: What's it? 
(The Tardis is materialising out of sight.) 
VINER: It sounded like an engine. Something came down over there behind that rock. 
HOPPER: Okay, Viner, slow down, I'll take care of this. Jim, behind that rock. 
CALLUM: (American) Okay, I've got it. 
(As the Americans hide, guns drawn, the Doctor, Victoria and Jamie come around the side of a scree. Victoria is in a daring knee-length dress.) 
HOPPER: Hold it right there, friend. 
DOCTOR: If you put it like that, I certainly will. 
CALLUM: Did you hear that, Professor? English. 
PARRY: Yes. All right, Hopper. 
(Hopper lowers his weapon.) 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
PARRY: Who are you and where do you come from? 
HOPPER: And you'd better have a good story. 
JAMIE: Maybe you'll not get one. 
HOPPER: Listen, fella, we're not playing games. 
ROGERS: You'd better listen to him. 
DOCTOR: Now what's been happening over here? 
(The Doctor goes over to the body.) 
KLIEG: He was killed the moment you made your appearance. 
DOCTOR: Ah, and you think we did it? Oh, no. I can assure you that we had nothing to do with the death of this man. He appears to have been electrocuted. Trying to open these doors perhaps? 
ROGERS: He seems to know all the answers. 
HOPPER: A wise guy. 
VINER: I think this fellow must be the member of a rival expedition. 
DOCTOR: Expedition? 
PARRY: We've tried to keep it a secret. Unsuccessfully now it appears. 
VINER: Look at him. Archaeologist written all over him. 
DOCTOR: Really? Does it show? 
VINER: There, you see? It's impossible to keep a secret in the scientific world. 
VICTORIA: Doctor, what do you mean? 
JAMIE: Tell them, Doctor. Go on, tell them. 
DOCTOR: No. Not until they tell me what the purpose of their expedition. 
PARRY: This is an archaeological expedition. We're searching the universe for the last remains of the Cybermen. 
JAMIE: Cybermen? You mean to say they came from here? 
PARRY: But of course. Telos was their home. This is the entrance to their city. 
VINER: We know they died out many centuries ago. What we don't know is why they died out. 
HOPPER: Callum, Rogers, get him back to the rocket. I'll be with you in a minute. 
CALLUM: Okay. 
HOPPER: Well, that's that. Are you coming back to the rocket with me, Professor? 
PARRY: What for? 
HOPPER: You're not going on with this, are you? Look I don't know if these people have anything to do with it or not, but one of my men has just been killed. You're not paying that kind of money. 
PARRY: Yes, I suppose that's quite true. 
HOPPER: Yeah, you think it over. Come on, let's go. We'll wait for you back at the ship. 
DOCTOR: The problem, I take it, is to open these doors, right? 
KLIEG: Ha, brilliant. 
PARRY: That is the problem. 
KLIEG: And we would prefer it if you returned to wherever you came from. 
JAMIE: Oh, not very friendly, are they, Doctor? 
VICTORIA: Oh yes, do as he says. 
DOCTOR: I'm afraid that that became impossible the moment that name was mentioned. 
VICTORIA: What name? 
DOCTOR: Cybermen. 
VICTORIA: Cybermen? What are they? 
VINER: I knew they were here on the same quest. 
PARRY: No one would come here for any other reason. 
DOCTOR: We must stay. 
JAMIE: Oh, Doctor! 
VICTORIA: Oh, must we? I don't like the look of those things at all. 
DOCTOR: We shall stay and help you with your search. 
KLIEG: Perhaps we don't want your help. 
DOCTOR: That's just it, you so obviously do. Now I'm sure we can agree. I can open those doors for you. 
KLIEG: It is our problem, and I suggest you take this ridiculous expedition of yours off this planet. 
JAMIE: It seems to me that we've got as much right here as you have. 
PARRY: Of course you have. Mister Klieg, must I remind you again that you do not speak for this expedition? I am it's leader, you and Miss Kaftan are only here on sufferance. 
KLIEG: Thank you. And whose money is paying for the hire of that rocket? 
KAFTAN: Mine! 
PARRY: I thought I made it quite clear that your financial support did not entitle you to a say in the running of this expedition. 
KAFTAN: Of course it was quite clear. Was it not, Eric? 
KLIEG: Of course. No one questions your leadership. 
DOCTOR: Ah, good, that's all settled. And now we shall open these doors. 
JAMIE: What? 
PARRY: Careful, man! 
HAYDON: Hey look out! 
VICTORIA: Doctor! 
(The Doctor puts his magnetic voltmeter on the handles, checks the reading and removes it.) 
DOCTOR: It's perfectly safe now. 
PARRY: You'll be killed! 
HAYDON: No, don't touch him! 
(The Doctor grabs a handle and pulls but can't move it.) 
DOCTOR: I'm afraid it's beyond my strength. 
JAMIE: Let me, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Jamie. 
(Jamie can't move them either.) 
JAMIE: Aye, well, I've not had much exercise lately. 
DOCTOR: Quite. I think here is a gentleman who can open these doors for us. 
KAFTAN: He is my servant. I will not have him risk his life. 
PARRY: Surely it was for just such a contingency as this that you insisted we bring him with us? 
DOCTOR: Oh, there's no danger now. Unless of course he's afraid. 
(Toberman steps forward.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, he's not afraid. 
(Toberman pulls open the right door then the left. They are about a foot thick.) 
PARRY: Come on. 
DOCTOR: No, wait, wait. I would be very careful in there if I were you. 
HAYDON: But why wasn't Toberman killed? Why weren't you killed? 
DOCTOR: The poor fellow who died drained all there electricity out of his body. It's perfectly safe to go in there now. 
KLIEG: Come on, then. We're wasting time. Of course. After you, Professor. 
(Parry, Klieg and the party walk inside.) 
DOCTOR: But I'd still. I'd still be very careful if I were you. Very careful indeed! Come on, let's go and join them. Come on, Victoria. 
(Victoria stays rooted to the spot.) 
DOCTOR: You look very nice in that dress, Victoria. 
VICTORIA: Thank you. Don't you think it's a bit 
DOCTOR: A bit short? Oh, I shouldn't worry about that. Look at Jamie's. 
JAMIE: Hey, I'll have you know that. Oh, aye. 
DOCTOR: Come along. Come along. Let's go and see what the others are doing, shall we? Come along.

[Central chamber]

(They walk down a small slope into a clean metal room. There are banks of instruments below a big dial to our right, a doorway with a Cyberman image above it ahead, and more instrumentation to the left.) 
VICTORIA: Mercy, just look at this place. 
VINER: These controls are of their earlier dynasty. 
HAYDON: Not so very early as all that by the look of it. Look, John. 
VINER: Yes, I'm quite capable of making my own deductions, thank you. 
HAYDON: All right. 
(To the left of the main doorway is a large hatch cover.) 
KLIEG: Be careful. There might be danger in there. 
KAFTAN: Don't worry, with Toberman to guard me. What is more important is to keep an eye on these strangers. 
KLIEG: Well I tried to 
KAFTAN: Do not raise your voice. You will achieve nothing by shouting. You look after the Doctor and I will watch the girl. 
KLIEG: And the Scots boy? 
KAFTAN: Leave him to Toberman. Ay, Toberman? But you will be careful and discreet, understand? 
TOBERMAN: I understand. 
JAMIE: Did you ever seen the like of it Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Not exactly, Jamie, but very nearly. 
PARRY: Now that we're all here. Now that we're all here, I think we'd better take stock of the situation. This appears to be a dead end. The only way out appears to be through that hatch. 
KAFTAN: Are there no doors? 
PARRY: No, apart from the entrance. 
DOCTOR: And the other two, of course. 
VINER: Two other doors? 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. One in that section, and one in that section over there. Activated, I imagine, by this simple logical system over here. Here we are, I think. 
(The Doctor moves levers 6, 4 and 5, there's a beep and a door to the right of the entrance slides up.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, splendid, splendid. A simple logical gate. 
(He does the same with another set of levers and the door opposite the entrance lifts.) 
KLIEG: Doctor, you seem to be very familiar with this place. 
DOCTOR: Oh no, not really. It's all based upon symbolic logic, the same as you use in computers. The opening mechanism for this door, an OR gate. you call it. 
KLIEG: Yes, yes, I can see that, but how did you know in the first place? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I use my own special technique. 
KLIEG: Oh really, Doctor? And may we know what that is? 
DOCTOR: Keeping my eyes open and my mouth shut. 
PARRY: We're far too many to explore together. I think we'd better divide up. If you, Mister Viner would take that door with er 
JAMIE: Jamie. 
PARRY: Jamie and Mister Haydon. Mister Klieg, the Doctor and myself will make up the other party. 
VICTORIA: Well, what about us? 
PARRY: I think the women had better remain here. 
VICTORIA: Oh, rubbish. We can make a party. 
KAFTAN: Certainly. With Toberman to guard us we need fear no one. 
PARRY: Right. Mister Klieg, will you take them along with you? 
KLIEG: I prefer to stay here. 
PARRY: As you wish. Mister Viner, will you go along with the women? 
VINER: If you like. 
PARRY: But get back to the spacecraft by 1630. You all know the temperature drop at night, so we'll meet back here at 1625. If anyone is missing that'll give us an hour to look for them before we have to leave. 
VINER: Come on, then. we might as well try that opening over there. 
KAFTAN: We'd better keep close together. 
VICTORIA: I'm all right thank you. 
(They go through the central doorway.) 
HAYDON: Come on, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Right. 
(Haydon and Jamie take the right hand door.) 
PARRY: Now to concentrate on this, whatever it is. This hatch must lead somewhere and there must be some opening mechanism. What was that about symbolic logic? Any ideas? 
DOCTOR: No, not really. I think it's about time we gave Mister Klieg a chance to show off his archaeological skills? I love to see the experts at work, don't you?

[Projector room]

(The central door has led to a room full of equipment. It is dominated by a contraption with three projectors.) 
VINER: Come on. Right in. Where's Toberman? 
KAFTAN: I sent him to join the others. We do not need any other protection now that you are with us. 
VINER: Yes, well, shall we commence? Everything must be carefully measured and recorded. 
VICTORIA: What is this room? 
VINER: I don't know. Possibly this is where the Cybermen are made. 
VICTORIA: I wonder what this is. 
VINER: Do you mind? You're getting in my way. Just go over there, will you? 
VICTORIA: Oh, fiddle! 
KAFTAN: Could this not be the purpose of the room? 
VINER: Yes? 
KAFTAN: A Cyberman would stand in that form and be, well, revitalised? 
(There is a large Cyberman-shaped recess opposite the projector.) 
VINER: Yes, that's reasonable. These projectors were probably made to fire in neuro-electric potential. Yes, that's it, I think you're right. 
VICTORIA: Revitalising is just what I need. 
(Victoria tries to step into the recess, but the leg slots are too long for her.) 
VICTORIA: Oh mercy, the Cybermen must have been giants. 
VINER: Will you please be careful. The first rule of archaeological work is that nothing must be touched until its been described and recorded.

[Testing room]

JAMIE: Hey, you know, it's just struck me. All the corridors in here are as light as day, yet there are no windows. 
HAYDON: Alpha-meson phosphor. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
HAYDON: It's a lighting system that never goes out. Works by letting cosmic rays bombard a layer of barium. 
JAMIE: Oh aye, that. 
HAYDON: Point is, what was this room used for? 
JAMIE: Well, possibly for raising caterpillars, like this one. 
HAYDON: Hey, for heavens sake watch out until we know what it is. 
JAMIE: Och, it's as dead as a stone. 
(Jamie is holding a tiny metallic creature with a pair of staring eyes and little antennae.)

[Central chamber]

(The big dial is lit up now, and flashing blocks of numbers as the indicator finger swings to and fro.) 
PARRY: Well? 
KLIEG: Well, the basis of this code is binary to digital conversion with a intervening step involving a sort of Whitehead logic. 
Well, when this Burrier series is complete, there is no more to be done. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but why do it at all? 
PARRY: Really, Doctor, for an archaeologist you seem to be curiously lacking in curiosity. 
DOCTOR: Some things are better left undone, and I have a feeling that this is one of them. 
KLIEG: What do you mean by that? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's all too easy, isn't it? 
KLIEG: Easy? 
PARRY: I wouldn't call this an easy survey, would you, Klieg? 
KLIEG: Everything here is designed to keep their secrets, whatever they are, insoluble. 
DOCTOR: Insoluble? 
KLIEG: But take this 
DOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn't say that. 
KLIEG: But take this mathematical sequence, for example. I'm really no nearer to it's solution. I've tried every possible combination. You'd hardly call that easy! 
(The Doctor reads Klieg's notebook.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, what you've done here is mostly right. 
KLIEG: Why, thank you. 
DOCTOR: You see, if you take any progressive series it can be converted into binary notation. If you take the sum of the integrants, and express the result as a power series, then the indices show the basic binary blocks. Only I wouldn't do it if I were you. Oh no, I really wouldn't do it! 
KLIEG: Of course. You're right. 
(Klieg goes to the row of levers below the dial and starts moving them.) 
KLIEG: Look! Sum between limits of one and nine one integral into power series. Yes! yes! Then you differentiate 
(There is a sound of increasing power generation. The lights start to flicker.) 
DOCTOR: You fool! Why couldn't you leave it alone! 
PARRY: What's happening? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. Perhaps the Cybermen aren't quite as dormant as you imagine. We must find out what has happened to the others.

[Projector room]

(Victoria climbs into the recess again. Kaftan goes to a control panel and pulls a lever. The lid of the recess closes as Victoria screams.) 
VINER: Did you touch anything? 
KAFTAN: No! 
VINER: Well, keep away from that board. Here, help me. 
(Kaftan is about to move another lever.) 
KAFTAN: One moment. 
VINER: Now! 
(She leaves it and joins him at the recess lid.) 
VINER: We'll need a crowbar to get this off. 
KAFTAN: It may already be too late.

[Testing room]

JAMIE: That's strange. 
HAYDON: What? 
JAMIE: I could swear that that thing moved. 
HAYDON: You're seeing things, old chap! Come and look at this. The whole control panel is active suddenly. I don't know which button to press first. 
JAMIE: Oh, I wouldn't touch it if I were you. 
HAYDON: I think I'll try this one. Nothing. 
JAMIE: Hey, wait a minute. What's happening? It's getting dark. Hey, look at the far wall! 
(Patterns of light are swirling.)

[Projector room]

VINER: It's no use. I daren't touch anything. If I operate the wrong sequence, she'll die. I must find the logical order. If it's not too late. 
(Viner bangs on the lid. Victoria knocks back.) 
KAFTAN: She's still alive! 
VINER: Thank heavens. Look, I'd better go and get the others, You stay her with her. 
KAFTAN: Yes, but hurry. 
VINER: I won't be long. 
(Viner leaves. Kaftan knocks on the lid and gets a reply. Then she goes to the row of levers and moves another one. The Doctor enters as the projectors move up and down.) 
DOCTOR: I wouldn't touch the projector controls if I were you. Someone might get hurt. 
VINER: There must be some way to release it, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes, there is. Now let me see.)

[Testing room]

(Jamie is mesmerised while Haydon is shielding his eyes with his hands.) 
HAYDON: Jamie. Jamie, don't watch it. 
JAMIE: I must. I must. I can't seem to take my eyes off it. I don't want to take my eyes off it. I don't want to take my eyes off it. 
(Jamie walks forward.) 
HAYDON: Stop, Jamie! 
JAMIE: Yes, yes, I see it now. 
(Haydon moves the lever back to its start position and the wall goes blank.) 
HAYDON: Are you all right? 
JAMIE: Oh, where have I been? 
HAYDON: You've been under some form of hypnosis. 
JAMIE: That's ridiculous. What would the Cybermen want with a hypnotising machine? 
HAYDON: Yes, you're right. It must be for something else. Wait a minute. Know what it could be? 
JAMIE: What? 
HAYDON: Some kind of target. I remember reading about this somewhere. They used to have something like it on Earth years ago. 
JAMIE: How does it work? Which bit do you aim at? 
HAYDON: There's a subliminal centre which you're trained to see. 
JAMIE: Oh, aye. A what? 
HAYDON: Come on, lets run the whole thing again and see what happens. But keep your eyes off the wall. Now you work the controls this time and I'll watch. 
JAMIE: Right. 
HAYDON: Okay, press the buttons. 
(Haydon watches through his fingers.)

[Projector room]

DOCTOR: Yes I think this is the sequence. Stand by to let her out, will you. And if you, my dear, would stand well clear. Thank you. Right! 
(The lid swings open and Victoria comes out, gasping.) 
DOCTOR: Victoria, are you all right? It's all right. Get your breath. It's all right. 
VICTORIA: I, I 
DOCTOR: It's all right now. 
VICTORIA: I didn't like that very much Doctor! 
DOCTOR: No, I don't expect you did. You'll have to be a little more careful in future, won't you. Now, come along. We must go and see whether Jamie is all right. Come along.

[Central chamber]

PARRY: There must be some way to get that hatch open. 
KLIEG: That must be the control to do it. 
(Wrong lever.) 
PARRY: The tombs of the Cybermen must be below ground, together with all their records. If we can't get down there, all our work here and the sacrifice of that unfortunate fellow's life will go in vain. 
KLIEG: A great deal more than that 
PARRY: Pardon? 
KLIEG: Of course. There's only one explanation. The Doctor. 
PARRY: Yes? 
KLIEG: He didn't give us the complete code. There must be a further sequence to operate that opening mechanism. 
PARRY: All right. Well, lets try and find out. 
KLIEG: Now, what could it be?

[Testing room]

(The wall has moves from spirals to fractals. Jamie moves the last lever and it goes blank.) 
HAYDON: Is that all? 
JAMIE: Aye. All except this big button here. What does that do? 
HAYDON: I'm not sure, but we'll soon find out. I'm going to trace the source of these shapes. There must be a projector somewhere. Look, when I give the word, press the button. 
JAMIE: The big one? 
HAYDON: Yes. Maybe it works in conjunction with the others. 
JAMIE: Right. Ready when you are. 
HAYDON: Okay, go ahead. 
(We notice that Haydon is standing in front of a possible door in the back wall. The swirling pattern is a figure of eight. The Doctor enters.) 
DOCTOR: Oh Jamie, don't touch that control! 
JAMIE: I already have. What's the matter Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well, which one was it? 
JAMIE: Which one what? 
(A Cyberman come in from the right across the front of the psychedelic screen and a weapon comes out of the wall opposite. It fires, catching Haydon squarely in the back. Victoria screams.)

Episode Two

[Testing room]

DOCTOR: What exactly happened here, Jamie? What did you do? What sequence did you use? 
JAMIE: Sequence, how do you mean? Oh, you mean these! Oh, well, I just pressed that button and pulled this lever and then that lever there. 
PARRY: Doctor, could you spare us a moment? I. Haydon! What's happened? 
VINER: He's dead. Don't you see, he's dead? It's this damn building. It's alive. It's watching us! It'll get us all! We've got to leave! 
PARRY: All right, Viner. This is terrible. How did it happen? 
VINER: We've got to get out this building. It's deadly! They'll kill all of us if we don't get back to rocket. 
DOCTOR: They? 
VINER: The Cybermen! Didn't you see it? 
PARRY: Cybermen? A live Cyberman? My dear Viner, they've been dead for the last five hundred years. 
VINER: I tell you it was a Cyberman and it came out of there, that screen thing. 
JAMIE: He's right. 
VINER: Keep back! Keep back! You'll bring it out again. 
DOCTOR: The question is, what killed him. 
VINER: But you saw the Cyberman, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: I saw something. 
VINER: Well? 
DOCTOR: Poor Haydon was looking at that screen, in the direction we all were, right? 
VINER: Of course. Must you state the obvious? 
DOCTOR: It's not so obvious when you consider he was shot in the back. 
JAMIE: In the back? 
PARRY: Are you sure, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: See for yourself. Now if the Cybermen didn't shoot him, what did? The answer, I think, lies over here. Jamie? 
JAMIE: Yes, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Can you remember exactly what you did, what sequence you used? 
JAMIE: Oh, I'm not sure, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: You must try. I want to repeat it all when I give the word. 
JAMIE: Very well, Doctor. 
VINER: You're crazy, man. You'll bring that, that thing out again. 
DOCTOR: Maybe. I don't know. Now, Jamie, when you're ready. 
JAMIE: Anytime, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Now there is a distinct element of risk in what I'm asking you all to do, so if anyone wishes to leave they must do so at once. Not you, Jamie. 
VINER: Can't you stop this? He'll kill us all. 
DOCTOR: Not if you go back against that wall, in that corner there. Now, please. Right, Jamie. 
(Jamie pulls two levers and presses the big button. The figure of eight pattern appears on the wall and the Cyberman slides out in front of it. The weapon comes out of the opposite wall and this time the Cyberman is decapitated. Victoria screams. The Doctor ducks under the weapon's turret to examine it.) 
JAMIE: Careful, Doctor! 
DOCTOR: It's all right. I think. I think it's all right now. Yes. You see, it's just a mock up, a model. No, don't touch that. That gun may be wired up too. 
PARRY: It's a trap. 
DOCTOR: No I don't think so. I think it's a testing room for weapons. This is a purely robotic Cyberman. There's no human material in it at all. He's a target for weapons. 
PARRY: Let's get back to the control room with this poor fellow. 
VICTORIA: What's that? 
JAMIE: Some wee creature I found on the floor there. 
(Victoria picks it up.) 
VICTORIA: It's a fossil. 
DOCTOR: Victoria, be careful. Let me see that. 
(The Doctor takes the metal creature.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, it's certainly inactive, but it's not a fossil. Wait a minute. 
(The Doctor takes out a notebook.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, here we are. Yes, it's a Cybermat. 
VICTORIA: What's a Cybermat? 
DOCTOR: It's one of those. I'd leave it alone if I were you. Come along. 
(Victoria puts the Cybermat into her huge handbag.)

[Central chamber]

(Toberman enters from outside.) 
KAFTAN: Well? 
TOBERMAN: It is done. 
KAFTAN: Good. 
KLIEG: I just don't understand this code. This sequence doesn't make complete sense. 
KAFTAN: You, a logician, you can't understand it? 
KLIEG: But in the time 
KAFTAN: You must. 
KLIEG: In the time we have. 
KAFTAN: We have plenty of time. You will see. 
PARRY: Lay him down there. 
(Haydon has been carried in.) 
KAFTAN: What has happened to him? 
VINER: There's been a terrible accident. He's been shot! 
PARRY: Right, we're all here, it seems. Will you all sit down for a moment? 
KAFTAN: Toberman? 
TOBERMAN: Yes. 
PARRY: Mister Klieg? 
KLIEG: Leave me alone. Can't you see I'm working, or have you forgotten the purpose of this expedition? 
PARRY: This directly concerns my expedition. You will kindly take your place. Right, I'll come straight to the point. I have reluctantly decided to abandon the expedition and return to Earth. 
(General consternation.) 
PARRY: I feel as strongly about it as you. This expedition has been my dream for many years. But there were those like Mister Viner who said that more preparation was needed, more men and equipment. I refused to heed their warnings and the result is that two men have died. I'm sorry, but we must leave at the first available conjunction. We'll take back all we can for further study, of course, but that is my decision and that is what we must do. 
KLIEG: I insist that 
PARRY: My decision is final! We leave when the north hemisphere is properly tangential, which will be at eighteen forty two. Ah, Captain Hopper. Just the man. Can you be ready to blast off at eighteen forty two? 
HOPPER: No. 
PARRY: I beg your pardon? Did I hear you right? You are paid to take orders, Captain Hopper. 
HOPPER: Not impossible ones, I'm not. It's the fuel pumps. Some character has balled up the lot. 
DOCTOR: Or something. 
HOPPER: Well, whatever it is, it's practically wrecked our chances of getting off this crummy planet. 
(A little later, discussions have been on-going.) 
VINER: I don't care what any of you say. I utterly refuse. I will not spend the night on this planet. 
DOCTOR: I don't think we've got much choice. 
VINER: Well, at least we can get out of this sinister building. I've recorded all the necessary details, I suggest we all go back to the rocket. 
HOPPER: You make a very bad suggestion, Viner, you know that? 
VINER: I insist. 
HOPPER: You do a lot of insisting. Well, I'm going to tell you something now. The first guy that set sets foot in my rocketship is going to stop the repair work just like that. 
PARRY: How long will it take to get the rocket operational again? 
HOPPER: Working non-stop without interruption, maybe seventy two hours. 
PARRY: Seventy two hours! 
VINER: But that's impossible! We'd all be out of our minds after three days in this place. We must go back on board. 
HOPPER: Now look, I can't afford to waste any more time with you guys, but I'll give it to you just once more, all right? Now you may not know this but we practically have to pull that ship apart to fix the damage. And there just isn't room for all of you on board. Especially with you insisting all over the place. No room to work, got it? 
PARRY: Yes, of course. I see now. 
VINER: It's all right for you. Have you any idea what it's like in this deadly building? 
HOPPER: Well it's not exactly peaches back on the ship. 
DOCTOR: Captain, you do have another reason for not wanting them back on the ship, don't you? 
HOPPER: Yeah. Until I find who broke into that rocket. 
DOCTOR: Or what? 
HOPPER: Who broke into the rocket. Until then I'm going to keep a round the clock guard on it. 
DOCTOR: I see. 
HOPPER: I'm going to get off this place with my skin still fitting tight all over, all right? 
DOCTOR: All right. 
HOPPER: Now, in case it gets cold at night, I've brought these anoraks and some food. I'll let you know when I'm ready to take off. 
(Hopper leaves.) 
KLIEG: As we have to stay, we might as well finish our job and fully explore down there. That is, if the Professor has no objection. 
PARRY: We have no alternative. it seems. 
DOCTOR: Well, but can't we stay here? It seems a pleasant enough room to me. 
JAMIE: Hey, you speak for yourself. 
KLIEG: Of course you can leave here anytime you please, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I was forgetting. I can, can't I. 
VICTORIA: But you're not going to are you, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: No. Not just yet awhile, no. But you and Jamie can go back to the Tardis if you wish. 
VICTORIA: I'll stay with you. 
DOCTOR: Jamie? 
JAMIE: Oh, I'll stay. 
DOCTOR: Good. 
DOCTOR: Now, I think it's about time we gave Mister Klieg some help. 
KLIEG: Thank you, I think I can manage. 
TOBERMAN: Stay! 
JAMIE: Hey, let the Doctor past or I'll 
(Toberman grabs the front of the Doctor's shirt in one hand.) 
JAMIE: Yes, well, let the Doctor past. 
DOCTOR: It's all right, Jamie. Your colleague has very strong hands. 
KAFTAN: Very strong. 
DOCTOR: Enough to do a good deal of damage if let loose in the right place. 
(Kaftan gestures Toberman to let the Doctor past.) 
PARRY: There's no doubt about it, the major workings lie below. There are metal caverns down there, all interconnected. If only we can get down into them. 
KLIEG: That's it! I've got it! Finally, a Boolean function of symbolic logic. 
DOCTOR: Logical, yes, but 
KAFTAN: Everything yields to logic. Our basic assumption, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Really. 
KLIEG: Six, cap, B four, if and only if, C is cap function of two A. 
(Klieg adjusts the main controls, pulls a lever, and nothing happens.) 
DOCTOR: I think perhaps your logic is wearing a little thin. 
KLIEG: I must have made a mistake. I'll do it again more carefully. Six, cap, B four, if and only if, C is cap function of, ah, that's it, two F not two A. 
(This time the big hatch by the entrance swings up, light coming from below.) 
VICTORIA: The hatch! 
KLIEG: I've done it! I've done it! 
DOCTOR: Congratulations. 
JAMIE: Yeah, but Doctor, you 
PARRY: Excellent! Now to work. It'll be extremely cold down there. We shall all need to put on warm clothing. Mister Viner, will you see about the anoraks? 
KLIEG: Just a moment. Are we all going down? 
PARRY: There is safety in numbers. 
KLIEG: The women as well? 
PARRY: Oh, they of course will stay up here. In case of trouble, contact the rocket. 
VICTORIA: I'm coming down with you. 
PARRY: But my dear young lady 
VICTORIA: You heard me, Professor. The 
DOCTOR: Victoria, you would be much safer up here. 
VICTORIA: But, Doctor, I 
DOCTOR: And much more use to us. 
VICTORIA: I don't see, 
DOCTOR: Keep an eye on (points at Kaftan) things. Please? 
VICTORIA: All right. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
PARRY: Well, if we're all ready, I shall lead the descent. Be ready to go back the instant I give the word. 
KLIEG: You know what to do. 
KAFTAN: The hatch? 
(The Doctor puts on his cape.) 
DOCTOR: Mister Toberman? 
KAFTAN: He stays with me. 
DOCTOR: Then I stay here too. 
KAFTAN: Of course, I am being selfish. His strength will be useful to you down there. He must go down. Go down, Toberman. 
(Toberman walks up the steps to the hatch, followed by the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: Remember what I said. Be very careful. 
(The men disappear down through the hatchway.) 
KAFTAN: It seems we are to be left alone to wait. Captain Hopper brought some food from the rocket. You would like some? 
VICTORIA: Oh, rather. I'm ravenous. 
(Victoria leaves her bag by the hatch.) 
KAFTAN: Roast beef? Roast veal? Chicken? 
VICTORIA: Oh, chicken, please 
(Kaftan hands over a small cube.) 
VICTORIA: What on Earth's this? 
KAFTAN: What you have asked for. Chicken. 
VICTORIA: Thank you, but I'm not very hungry now. 
(Victoria goes to look down the hatchway. Kaftan pours liquid from a thermos into a cup and drops a small pill into it with a smile.)

[Bottom of the ladder]

PARRY: Hurry up, there. We've no time to linger. It's extremely cold down here even with these anoraks. 
JAMIE: You obviously knew what to expect. 
DOCTOR: Well, which way do we go? 
KLIEG: I don't know. Let's try this way. 
DOCTOR: Yes.

[Cavern]

(There are active control panels in the room.) 
JAMIE: Hey, what on Earth?! 
PARRY: Behold, gentlemen. The tombs of the Cybermen! 
(The walls of the cavern are full of frosted compartments reaching high above them.) 
JAMIE: Tombs? I don't see any tombs. 
DOCTOR: In there, Jamie. Frozen forever. All their evil locked away with them. And so it must remain. 
KLIEG: Like a gigantic honeycomb. Like bees waiting the signal to arise from their winter sleep. 
DOCTOR: A signal that they're never going to get. 
VINER: We'd better get busy. Everything must be recorded. It's too cold to remain for long. 
KLIEG: Unless we find some way to warm things up.

[Central chamber]

KAFTAN: You have hardly touched your coffee. It must be cold by now. You would like some more? 
VICTORIA: No, thank you. I'm much warmer now. 
KAFTAN: That's good. 
VICTORIA: I feel so sleepy. 
(Victoria falls asleep by the steps to the hatch. Kaftan checks that she is out cold then closes the hatch cover.)

[Cavern]

(The thud is heard down below.) 
VINER: What was that? 
JAMIE: It sounded like the hatch!

[Bottom of the ladder]

JAMIE: It's closed! 
VINER: Oh, what's the use. We're trapped down here now. We'll never survive down in this cold. Better get back.

[Cavern]

DOCTOR: Well? 
VINER: It's closed. What have they done that for? What are they playing at up there? 
DOCTOR: Perhaps it wasn't them. Where's Jamie? 
VINER: He went up the ladder to try it. Professor. Professor, listen to me, for heaven's sake! The hatch is down again. We're trapped down here. 
PARRY: Trapped? But there are some of my party up there. Are you sure? 
VINER: Of course I'm sure. You know how heavy that thing is. It's down now. We must do something. I give us a couple of hours in here at the most. 
DOCTOR: Mister Klieg doesn't seem to be very worried. 
KLIEG: No, I'm not, Doctor. 
JAMIE: It won't open and I can't make anybody hear. 
VINER: There you are. 
KLIEG: There is an easy way out of our situation. 
VINER: You've found something? 
KLIEG: Of course you're forgetting your logic. If it closes it can be opened, from here. 
DOCTOR: Conveniently labelled in symbolic logic, I notice. 
KLIEG: Right, are we ready? I shall now operate the sequence. 
DOCTOR: If it is the opening device. 
KLIEG: It's obviously an opening device of some kind, Doctor. 
VINER: I don't know how you can be so blasted calm about it all! 
JAMIE: I'll see if it works then. 
JAMIE [OC]: Go ahead! 
(Klieg moves levers.) 
JAMIE [OC]: Nothing happening out here. 
VINER: It doesn't work. 
(Whilst the others concentrate on the hatch, Klieg turns to the vast network of tombs with a smile. They start to defrost.)

[Bottom of the ladder]

(Something drips on Parry.) 
PARRY: Water! 
JAMIE: Aye, it's getting warmer. 
VINER: The ice is melting. 
JAMIE: Hey, look behind you!

[Cavern]

VINER: Look! Look at the honeycomb! There's something inside. 
(There is movement inside the defrosted cells.) 
JAMIE: They're Cybermen. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, come back. 
PARRY: It is them. Gentlemen, they are perfect. This is unique in archaeology. 
VINER: No. No, they're moving. We must shut it down. 
(Viner moves levers and the Cybermen slow down.) 
KLIEG: What are you doing? Keep away from that! 
VINER: No! 
(Klieg produces a gun.) 
KLIEG: Keep away. 
DOCTOR: What do you think you're doing? 
KLIEG: I shall not hesitate to kill. For the last time, I'm asking you to get away from those controls. 
VINER: No! 
(Klieg shoots Viner.) 
PARRY: Viner! Viner, Viner. 
(Klieg moves the levers back to on.) 
PARRY: Viner, you've killed him! 
JAMIE: He's mad! 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
(The tombs defrost again.) 
PARRY: Haydon dead, now Viner. What kind of a man are you?! 
KLIEG: Back. Keep back! Let's see what happens. As the Professor says, this is a unique archaeological event. It would be such a pity to miss it.

[Central chamber]

(Something is moving and beeping inside Victoria's bag as she wakes from her nap.) 
VICTORIA: What's happened? 
KAFTAN: What? 
VICTORIA: The hatch is down. Are they back? 
KAFTAN: They are still down there. 
VICTORIA: Then why is the hatch down? They won't be able to get up again. 
KAFTAN: I shall open it when we are ready. 
VICTORIA: When who's ready? You closed it? 
KAFTAN: I did. 
VICTORIA: Then you'd better open it again, hadn't you! 
KAFTAN: No, it shall remain closed. 
VICTORIA: The Doctor warned me about you. 
KAFTAN: That was very clever of him. 
VICTORIA: Out of my way! 
KAFTAN: Why? 
VICTORIA: I'm going to open the hatch. 
(Kaftan pokes a gun in Victoria's back.) 
KAFTAN: Stand back! That's better. Now, let's move away from these controls. We shall be more comfortable over here, I think. 
VICTORIA: But why? Why have you done it? You've trapped your friends down there as well as mine! 
KAFTAN: I shall open it when Mister Klieg has completed our plans. Meanwhile, it is better that they remain undisturbed. If you touch those controls I shall have to kill you. 
(The Cybermat has chewed a hole in Victoria's bag and is trundling across the floor.)

[Cavern]

JAMIE: You know, Doctor, I have a feeling that man's planned it all. He knew that that control wouldn't open the hatch. 
DOCTOR: So did I, Jamie. 
JAMIE: You knew, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I wanted to know what he was up to. 
KLIEG: And now you know, Doctor. 
PARRY: We know nothing. This is the action of a lunatic. 
KLIEG: Lunatic? Not at all, Professor. A necessary detail, that's all. 
PARRY: But why? 
KLIEG: Logic, my dear Professor, logic and power. On Earth the Brotherhood of Logicians is the greatest man intelligence ever assembled. But that's not enough by itself. We need power. Power to put our ability into action. The Cybermen have this power. I have come here to find it and use it. 
PARRY: So that was your motive in financing my expedition. 
KLIEG: Precisely. Your complete lack of administration made it ideal for our purpose. 
DOCTOR: You think the Cybermen will help you? 
KLIEG: Of course. I shall be their resurrector. 
PARRY: Look! 
(The Cybermen start to rip their way out of their cells and climb down the ladders at either side of the block.)

[Central chamber]

(Victoria spots the Cybermat.) 
KAFTAN: Keep still. 
VICTORIA: Behind you! That thing, it's come alive! 
KAFTAN: You are so simple. You don't really expect to take me in with a trick like that? 
VICTORIA: It's true. Look! 
KAFTAN: Will nothing keep you still? 
VICTORIA: Oh, will you please look! 
KAFTAN: If I have any further trouble from you I will have to take drastic steps. 
VICTORIA: Why don't you believe me? 
KAFTAN: We will not allow a little girl like you to interfere with our plans. 
(The Cybermat jumps onto Kaftan's shoulder. She screams. Victoria pulls it off and throws it away, then picks up Kaftan's gun and shoots the little monster. It blows up and dies. Kaftan is out cold. Victoria looks at the row of control levers.) 
VICTORIA: I don't know. 
(She puts the gun down on the hatch steps and runs out.) 
VICTORIA: Captain Hopper!

[Cavern]

(The Cybermen ignore the humans and gather in front of a cyber logo at the base of the wall. They open it to reveal a slightly different design of Cyberman.) 
JAMIE: What is it? 
DOCTOR: I think it's their leader, their Controller, Jamie. 
(The Controller steps out of his cell. He has no chest unit and an extra tall head like a massive brain. The Cybermen salute him.) 
KLIEG: I am Klieg. Eric Klieg. I have brought you back to life. We of the Logicians have planned this. You are alive because of us. Now you will help us. We need your power. You need our mass intelligence. Are you listening? Do you understand me? Now that I have released you 
(The Controller grips Klieg's wrist and forces him to kneel.) 
KLIEG: Aaah! Let me go! I set you free! It was our plan! 
(The Controller tosses Klieg away from him.) 
CONTROLLER: You belong to us. You shall be like us.

Episode Three

[Cavern]

PARRY: How did you know that we would come to release you? You could have remained frozen forever. 
CONTROLLER: The humanoid mind. You are inquisitive. 
DOCTOR: Ah, I see, a trap. A very special sort of trap, too. 
PARRY: What do you mean, special trap? 
DOCTOR: Well, don't you see? They only wanted superior intellects. That's why they made the trap so complicated. 
CONTROLLER: We knew that somebody like you would come to our planet one day. 
DOCTOR: Yes, and we've done exactly as you've calculated, haven't we? 
CONTROLLER: Now you belong to us.

[Central chamber]

(Victoria has bought Hopper and Callum from the rocket. Kaftan is still unconscious.) 
VICTORIA: Now, quick. Find the opening device. I don't know which it is. 
HOPPER: Now hold on. I'm not pulling any levers until I know what this is all about. 
CALLUM: I don't reckon we should have left the rocket, Captain. I can't see much wrong here. 
VICTORIA: Not much wrong? Are you blind, the pair of you? What about this then? 
(The closed hatch.) 
CALLUM: I can't see any change, Vic. 
VICTORIA: That's just it. They're down there now. 
CALLUM: Then why close the hatch on them? 
(Kaftan wakes.) 
CALLUM: It doesn't make sense, Vic. 
VICTORIA: I didn't. And please stop calling me Vic. She closed the hatch. 
CALLUM: Oh, did she now? 
VICTORIA: Now look, are you going to help me or not? They're probably freezing to death down there. If you're not going to help me, I'm going to pull every one of those levers on that board and see what happens. 
HOPPER: Ah now, I wouldn't do that, Vic. Come on, Jim. I think we'd better do as she says. 
CALLUM: Yeah. 
HOPPER: Okay, now. Were you here when they opened it all up? 
VICTORIA: Yes. 
HOPPER: Well, come on. You must have some idea. 
VICTORIA: I don't know. I wasn't looking. Oh, I think it's one of those levers down there. 
CALLUM: She thinks!

[Cavern]

JAMIE: Can we not make a run for it, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: No, no. We wouldn't even reach the ladder. It's too risky. 
PARRY: What can we do? 
DOCTOR: We'll play for time. Wait our chance. Leave it to me. Excuse me. May I ask a question? Why did you submit yourself to freezing? You don't have to answer that if you don't want to. 
CONTROLLER: To survive. Our history computer has full details of you. 
DOCTOR: Oh? How? 
CONTROLLER: We know of your intelligence. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much. Ah, yes. The lunar surface. 
CONTROLLER: Our machinery had stopped and our supply of replacements been depleted. 
DOCTOR: So that's why you attacked the Moonbase. 
CONTROLLER: You had destroyed our first planet and we were becoming extinct. 
JAMIE: What difference does capturing us make? You'll still become extinct. 
CONTROLLER: We will survive. We will survive. Now you will help us. 
PARRY: What makes you think we're going to help you? That murderer doesn't speak for us. 
CONTROLLER: You will become the first of a new race of Cybermen. You will return to the Earth and control it. 
PARRY: Never! Never! 
CONTROLLER: Everything we decide is carried out. There are no mistakes. 
JAMIE: A new race of Cybermen? But we're humans. We're not like you. 
CONTROLLER: You will be. 
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no. Keep away! Keep away! Keep away from me! 
(The group of Cybermen take hold of the scientists and Toberman. Only Jamie manages to escape. A Cyberman goes after him but takes the wrong turn at a junction. Jamie doubles back to the ladder, and gets zapped there.) 
DOCTOR: If only you'd let go I'd stand still. 
TOBERMAN: Please, please, please let me go! Please, let me go! 
(The Cyberman struggling with Toberman picks him up and throws him into a pile of barrels.) 
DOCTOR: If you would let go of me, I can stand still! You're breaking my arm! 
CONTROLLER: To struggle is futile.

[Central chamber]

(Callum is looking at the wiring underneath a panel.) 
HOPPER: You sure that's the one? 
CALLUM: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's the only one it could be. Yeah. It leads up to that one there. Yeah. 
VICTORIA: Please hurry, Captain Hopper! 
HOPPER: Keep back, will you? Leave this to me. Jim, stand by the power cut off. 
(Kaftan crawls for her gun.) 
CALLUM: Power, yeah, yeah. 
HOPPER: Stand back, will you, just in case we got the wrong one. 
KAFTAN: Don't move! Raise your hands! 
HOPPER: Now look here, lady. 
KAFTAN: I shall kill you. 
HOPPER: Well, your own men are down there, remember? What are you doing this for? 
KAFTAN: Move away from that control board. Over here. I shall open the hatch when Klieg gives the signal. 
HOPPER: Well why close it in the first place? 
KAFTAN: Klieg must remain undisturbed. Your friends will not escape from there, and you will not interfere. 
(The Cyberman moves into view. Victoria screams and Kaftan looks behind her. Hopper jumps forward and grabs the gun.) 
HOPPER: Watch her, Jim. If she moves, blast her. 
CALLUM: Right. 
HOPPER: Ah, you scream real good, Vic! Thanks a lot. 
VICTORIA: Please, the hatch! 
HOPPER: Okay, we'll take a risk. Stand by. 
(Hopper pulls the lever and the hatch opens.) 
VICTORIA: It's very quiet down there. 
HOPPER: Yeah, too quiet. 
VICTORIA: Something must have happened. 
HOPPER: How long they been down there? 
VICTORIA: Oh, about an hour. 
HOPPER: That's too long. I'm going down. Hey, Jim, what are those bombs loaded with? 
CALLUM: Smoke. 
HOPPER: Great. Give us a couple, will you? 
CALLUM: Yeah, sure. 
HOPPER: Come on, come on. 
CALLUM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
(Callum takes two grenades from his bag.) 
HOPPER: Okay, here we go. 
VICTORIA: I'm coming too. 
HOPPER: Later, maybe. Not this trip. 
VICTORIA: Who'd be a woman. 
HOPPER: How would you know, honey? You'd better stay up here. We don't know what's going on down there. 
(Hopper goes down through the hatch.) 
VICTORIA: Is he always like that? 
CALLUM: Most of the time, Vic, yeah.

[Cavern]

(Everyone is sitting on the floor, including Jamie. The Doctor is tending to Toberman.) 
CONTROLLER: We have decided how you will be used. 
KLIEG: Yes? 
CONTROLLER: You are a logician. Our race is also logical. You will be the leader of the new race. 
KLIEG: You will listen to my proposals then? 
CONTROLLER: Yes, we will listen, but first you will be altered. 
KLIEG: Altered? 
CONTROLLER: You have fear. We will eliminate fear from your brain. Yes. You will be the first. 
CYBERMAN: And you will be the next. 
PARRY: I? No, no! 
CYBERMAN: You will be like us.
(Hopper takes the pin from a smoke grenade.) 
CONTROLLER: To die is unnecessary. You will be frozen and placed in our tombs until we are ready to use you. Your lives will be suspended. Prepare the tombs. 
PARRY: They really mean it. They're going to freeze us. 
JAMIE: Not me. 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie. They're coming back. 
(Hopper throws his smoke grenades and they go off at the base of the tombs. The Cybermen are disoriented.) 
HOPPER: Come on, you guys, run for it!

[Outside the cavern]

(The smoke is filling the passageways too.) 
DOCTOR: Is he all right? 
JAMIE: Aye, I think so. Which way is it? I can't remember. 
DOCTOR: That way. 
JAMIE: Are you sure? 
DOCTOR: No, I'm not sure, but try it. I'll be with you in a minute. 
JAMIE: All right. 
(Jamie and Parry go left. The Doctor returns to the cavern. Klieg turns right.) 
DOCTOR: Captain, we've got to stop them. 
HOPPER: Block off this tunnel perhaps? 
DOCTOR: No, we can't do that. The hatch. We must get there first. Come on. 
(Toberman gets captured by two Cybermen.)

[Cavern]

(Toberman is zapped into submission.) 
CONTROLLER: This humanoid is powerful. We will use him. Prepare him.

[Bottom of the ladder]

(Jamie is helping Parry up the ladder.) 
HOPPER: Hurry up, can't you? For Pete's sake, get a move on. 
JAMIE: I am. I can't breathe. Victoria! 
HOPPER: Come on, come on get up!

[Central chamber]

VICTORIA: Jamie! Look at that smoke. 
JAMIE [OC]: Victoria! 
(Hopper helps Jamie out.) 
JAMIE: Come on, Mister Parry. Come on, quick! Stand back. 
(Parry comes out, then Hopper.) 
HOPPER: The Cybermen, they're right behind us. 
(The Doctor makes it to the ladder and starts climbing, but there is a Cyberman right behind him.) 
HOPPER: As soon as the Doctor's up, slam down the hatch! 
CALLUM: Okay. Stand by! 
(The Doctor is almost out when...) 
DOCTOR: Oh! Ah! He's got my leg! 
JAMIE: Doctor, come on! Come on! 
DOCTOR: It's no use! 
(The Cyberman appears and grabs the Doctor's shoulders. Victoria grabs the thermos from the table and starts hitting the cyber man's arm with it. It lets go of the Doctor and grabs Victoria instead, leaning half out of the hatch.) 
HOPPER: Jim, close the hatch! 
JAMIE: Victoria! 
(Callum moves the lever and the hatch comes down on the Cyberman. It has to let go of Victoria to try and stop the hatch cover coming down. Finally it is shut.) 
CALLUM: Got him! 
(The hatch moves and fractures as the Cyberman beats on it, then it stops.) 
VICTORIA: It was horrible. It was so strong! 
JAMIE: It's all right, Victoria. You're all right now. 
PARRY: That was a near thing. Is anyone missing? 
HOPPER: Yes. Klieg and Toberman, they're still down there.

[Bottom of the ladder]

(Klieg is hiding as the Cyberman comes down and makes its report.) 
CONTROLLER: The humanoid has escaped? 
CYBERMAN: Yes. 
CONTROLLER: Guard the passageway. 
CYBERMAN: Yes. 
(The Controller and his aide leave. Klieg is at the top of the ladder, knocking fairly gently on the closed hatch for fear of being heard by the Cybermen.)

[Central chamber]

PARRY: Don't open it. It may be the Cybermen. 
DOCTOR: No. No, it's too soft. It must be Toberman and Klieg. 
HOPPER: Ah, you're crazy. 
PARRY: You're right. We can't leave them down there, even if they are killers. 
JAMIE: Oh, they're probably both frozen solid by now. 
(More knocking.) 
KAFTAN: You must let them up. They must be saved. 
DOCTOR: Yes, they're more dangerous down there than they are up here. 
HOPPER: What? Well, okay. Jim. 
CALLUM: All right. 
HOPPER: Okay, let her go. 
DOCTOR: Excuse me, please. 
(The Doctor pushes Kaftan behind him as the hatch opens. Hopper has his gun ready as Klieg climbs out.) 
KLIEG: Close it! Close it, quick! 
KAFTAN: Eric, where's Toberman? 
KLIEG: They've got him. 
DOCTOR: Do you still think you can form an alliance with the Cybermen, Mister Klieg? 
KLIEG: If I'd only been in a stronger position to bargain with them. 
PARRY: You must be out of your mind, Klieg. 
HOPPER: You're not in any position to bargain with anybody right now. Well, what are we going to do with him? 
PARRY: I'd feel much happier if they weren't left in here. 
DOCTOR: Well, what about the testing room? There's only one door. They can't get out. 
PARRY: That's a good idea. They'll be quite safe in there. 
HOPPER: Callum. 
CALLUM: Right. Mister Klieg? Miss Kaftan? 
HOPPER: Now, if I don't get back to the rocket, we're not going to take off inside a week. 
PARRY: We'll come with you. 
HOPPER: I told you before, not till I'm operational again. I'll let you know when that is. 
(He turns to the Doctor who is whispering to Jamie.) 
HOPPER: I don't think you'll have any more trouble with your friends down there. 
DOCTOR: We shall see.

[Cavern]

(The Controller tests a lever on the control panel.) 
CONTROLLER: Release the cyber mats. We will use the power of cybernetics. 
(Three large Cybermats are taken out.) 
CONTROLLER: Activate them. The brain of this humanoid will be their target. Now. 
(The foot or so long devices are put on the floor near Toberman, but they don't move.) 
CONTROLLER: These Cybermats are dormant through lack of use. Inspect them.

[Testing room]

(Something falls from the dummy Cyberman to the floor.) 
KLIEG: What's that? 
KAFTAN: Just me. 
KLIEG: Oh, be quiet. 
KAFTAN: Sleep later. Look at this. 
KLIEG: What is it? 
KAFTAN: One of the weapons they were testing. Look, here's the connection. 
KLIEG: Let me see. Oh yes, you're right. It's a Cybergun. Take a look at that control. See that everything is switched off. 
KAFTAN: Right. All the sequences show negative. 
KLIEG: Good. Now they will have to listen. 
(Klieg gets out a pair of pliers and starts work on the gun.)

[Cavern]

CYBERMAN: The Cybermats are ready. 
CONTROLLER: Stand clear. Now. 
(This time the Cybermats trundle towards Toberman.)

[Testing room]

(Klieg has removed the Cybergun from the dummy. He test fires it at a wall. The metal melts and burns.) 
KLIEG: Excellent. A small X-Ray laser. 
KAFTAN: What are you going to do now? 
KLIEG: Take command, of course. What do you think? With this I shall be able to deal with those people in there. 
KAFTAN: Never mind about them. The important thing for us is to control the Cybermen. 
KLIEG: Yes, I know but 
KAFTAN: Isn't it, Eric? 
KLIEG: You haven't been down there. You haven't seen those vile things. 
KAFTAN: You're not scared, are you? 
KLIEG: I have completely underestimated their power. 
KAFTAN: But this time we have the power, at least you do. The gun, Eric, the gun. You have the Cybermen's own weapon, this laser to turn against them. Now they will have to obey. If they refuse, we shall destroy the opening device and seal them up in their tomb forever. Now do you understand? 
KLIEG: Yes. Yes, you're right. I am invulnerable with this. I shall be master. 
KAFTAN: Come, let us deal with these people first. Eric? 
KLIEG: Master. The supreme moment in my life. It was logical. 
KAFTAN: Eric, we have work to do. 
KLIEG: Yes, yes, of course. But hardly work, more a pleasure. 
KAFTAN: What? 
KLIEG: The pleasure to test this on that Doctor and his companions. The others are of no consequence, but he will make a most precise target.

[Cavern]

CONTROLLER: Enough. These humanoids are not like us. They still have fear. Place the Cybermats on the runway. 
(The Cybermats are put on a small ramp leading into a hole in the wall.) 
CONTROLLER: Cybermats will attack.

[Central chamber]

(Everyone is asleep except Victoria, who has the gun. The Doctor yawns and Victoria turns the weapon on him. He raises his arms in surrender.) 
DOCTOR: I'm on your side, remember? Hey, why didn't you wake me? I should have been on watch half an hour ago. 
VICTORIA: I thought you should rest. 
DOCTOR: Why me? 
VICTORIA: No reason really. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I think I know. Is it because I'm 
VICTORIA: Well, if you are 450 years old, you need a great deal of sleep. 
DOCTOR: Well that's very considerate of you, Victoria, but between you and me, I'm really quite lively actually, all things being considered. 
(The Doctor takes the gun.) 
DOCTOR: Are you happy with us, Victoria? 
VICTORIA: Yes, I am. At least, I would be if my father were here. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I know, I know. 
VICTORIA: I wonder what he would have thought if he could see me now. 
DOCTOR: You miss him very much, don't you? 
VICTORIA: It's only when I close my eyes. I can still see him standing there, before those horrible Dalek creatures came to the house. He was a very kind man, I shall never forget him. Never. 
DOCTOR: No, of course you won't. But, you know, the memory of him won't always be a sad one. 
VICTORIA: I think it will. You can't understand, being so ancient. 
DOCTOR: Eh? 
VICTORIA: I mean old. 
DOCTOR: Oh. 
VICTORIA: You probably can't remember your family. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I can when I want to. And that's the point, really. I have to really want to, to bring them back in front of my eyes. The rest of the time they sleep in my mind, and I forget. And so will you. Oh yes, you will. You'll find there's so much else to think about. So remember, our lives are different to anybody else's. That's the exciting thing. There's nobody in the universe can do what we're doing. You must get some sleep and let this poor old man stay awake. 
(A Cybermat has entered the room. The Doctor puts his cloak around Victoria as she settles by the table. The metal creature homes in on his shoe and he feels it's bump.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, Victoria, Callum, wake up. Wake up! 
JAMIE: What? 
VICTORIA: What is it? 
(A second Cybermat jumps onto Callum's chest.) 
DOCTOR: Callum. Callum! 
VICTORIA: It's one of those terrible things again. 
DOCTOR: Don't move, Callum. Don't move. 
(The Doctor knocks the Cybermat off Callum's chest and helps him up.) 
DOCTOR: Now get back to the controls, all of you. Steady, don't make any sudden movements. Parry, Parry. Wake up, Parry. Wake up. Wake up. Don't panic. Come back with us. Steady. Now we'll all go in the other room and lock them out. 
(Victoria screams. The first Cybermat is heading for them.) 
CALLUM: Let's get out of here. The main doors. No, look. 
(The third Cybermat is there.) 
VICTORIA: Oh Doctor, we're trapped. 
DOCTOR: Back against the controls, everybody. 
(The Doctor picks up the big power cable he was sleeping against.) 
DOCTOR: Here. Five me a hand, quick. 
PARRY: What? 
DOCTOR: Lay this down on the ground. Come on! 
JAMIE: They'll go over it, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Come on! 
(The Doctor lays the cable in an arc in front of the control panel.) 
CALLUM: Let's blast the filthy things! 
(Callum puts three bullets into a Cybermat, wrecking it.) 
DOCTOR: You're wasting your time. There are too many of them. Now, do what I say. Come back! 
(The Doctor puts power through the cable. It smokes and the Cybermats start spinning.) 
DOCTOR: There you are, you see. 
PARRY: What are those creatures? 
DOCTOR: Well, they're a form of metallic life. They home on human brainwaves and attack. 
(The Cybermats have all keeled over and stopped moving.) 
VICTORIA: Are they safe now? 
DOCTOR: Yes, quite safe now. The power cable generated an electrical field and confused their tiny metal minds. You might almost say that they've had a complete metal breakdown. 
(Jamie groans.) 
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry, Jamie. 
VICTORIA: What about Klieg and Kaftan? They've probably attacked them as well. 
PARRY: The testing room. 
DOCTOR: Come on. Now mind your feet. 
KLIEG: Most ingenious, Doctor. Now, let's see what you can do against this. 
(Klieg raises the Cybergun.) 
CALLUM: Watch out, Doctor! 
(Klieg fires the Cybergun.)

Episode Four

[Central chamber]

(Victoria screams. Callum falls to the floor clutching his shoulder. Everyone else is already on the floor. Parry goes to help Callum.) 
KLIEG: Keep back! Your gun. 
(Klieg hands Parry's gun to Kaftan.) 
PARRY: You've killed him, you murderer. 
KLIEG: No, he is fortunate, I spared him. 
JAMIE: You mean you missed him. 
KLIEG: Silence. I could have destroyed him if I wanted to. Shall I kill them now? 
KAFTAN: No, no, that will not be necessary. I'm sure the Cybermen will have a good use for them. You will make excellent experimental specimens. 
VICTORIA: Oh, let me help him, please. 
KLIEG: No tricks. 
DOCTOR: You still think you can bargain with the Cybermen? 
KLIEG: Certainly. And this time on our terms. 
(Klieg opens the hatch and shouts down through it.) 
KLIEG: I wish to speak to the Controller. I wish to speak to the Controller!

[Cavern]

KLIEG [OC]: I wish to speak to the Controller! 
CONTROLLER: The humanoids must first be destroyed. You will re-enter cells to conserve energy. 
CYBERMAN: He is now prepared. 
CONTROLLER: Release him. 
(Toberman sits up, staring at nothing and with a metal-looking arm. The Cybermen climb back into their tombs and seal themselves up again.)

[Central chamber]

KLIEG: They're coming. And now, gentlemen, you will see how I shall use the power of the Cybermen. 
DOCTOR: Use maybe, but you'll never control the Cybermen. 
KAFTAN: Eric, behind you! 
KLIEG: Stop. You know what this can do to you. 
(The Controller stands at the top of the ladder with Toberman behind him.) 
KLIEG: That's better. Now you are under my control. We know you must be revitalised or you will perish. If you agree to my terms, I shall let you survive. 
CONTROLLER: I will listen. 
KAFTAN: Make them release Toberman. 
JAMIE: If you think they'll listen to you, you're even dafter than I thought. 
KLIEG: Silence. Sit down. First, you release our man. 
(The Controller's brain send energy into Toberman's head. Toberman walks out of the hatchway, not looking where he is putting his feet.) 
KAFTAN: Toberman, it is good that you are back. Watch them. 
JAMIE: Doctor, he seems er 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, yes. 
(The Controller is coming down the steps.) 
KLIEG: Stay where you are! Now, do you agree to accept our plan? 
DOCTOR: Plan? 
KLIEG: The conquest of the Earth. 
PARRY: What? You must be out of your mind. 
KLIEG: Silence! Your answer? 
CONTROLLER: We accept. We will give you some of our power devices. 
KLIEG: Good. I knew an understanding could be reached. I shall let you be revitalised. To survive, it must be now. Come forward. Slowly. 
KAFTAN: Eric, be careful. 
KLIEG: Leave this to me. 
(The Controller goes to the door to the power room.) 
PARRY: You're absolutely crazy to trust them! 
KLIEG: Do you think so? Then perhaps you and your colleagues had better join him. Go on, go on! 
KLIEG: The girl stays with us! 
DOCTOR: No! 
KLIEG: Any trouble, she is our hostage. 
(Klieg closes the door to the power room on them.) 
KLIEG: Close the hatch. 
(Toberman doesn't move.) 
KAFTAN: Go on, close it. 
(Toberman still doesn't move so Kaftan does it herself.)

[Projector room]

(The Controller is trying to get into the Cyberman shaped recess where Victoria got herself trapped.) 
JAMIE: He's too weak to get in. 
DOCTOR: Quiet, Jamie. 
(The Doctor goes over to the Controller.) 
DOCTOR: You seem to be in trouble. 
CONTROLLER: The energy levels are low. We will survive. You will help us. You will help us. 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, certainly. Jamie, Professor. 
JAMIE: You don't mean to say you're actually going to help them? 
PARRY: Surely not? You can't support these creatures. 
DOCTOR: I think it best. Come on. Come along. 
(They help the Controller into the recess.) 
DOCTOR: That's it. Up and in. 
CONTROLLER: (winding down) Do you understand the machine? 
DOCTOR: Yes. One moment. 
JAMIE: Have you taken leave of your senses? Now let's go and help Victoria. 
DOCTOR: In a moment, Jamie. Now, are you ready? 
(The projector head swings up and down and the recess door closes on the Controller.) 
CONTROLLER: We will survive. We will sur 
DOCTOR: Now then, where would you rather have him, in or out of there? 
JAMIE: Oh, I see what you mean. 
DOCTOR: Only we must make sure that he stays in there.

[Central chamber]

(Victoria has put Callum's arm in a sling.) 
VICTORIA: Do you really believe you can bargain with those terrible Cybermen? 
KAFTAN: That is our concern, not yours. 
VICTORIA: I'm talking to him, not you. 
KLIEG: They will have to agree to our plan. 
VICTORIA: What about the other weapon? 
KLIEG: What other weapon? 
VICTORIA: Well, I saw another one like that in that room over there. 
KLIEG: Is that true? 
KAFTAN: I don't know. We'd better make sure. 
KLIEG: No, wait. That means that any one of them in there could 
KAFTAN: Yes, you're right, Eric. 
KLIEG: Better wait here. If the Cyberman is aroused, we shall be ready for him. Now stay well clear. Take no chances. 
(Toberman is staring at Klieg.)

[Projector room]

(The recess lid has been tied down. The projector head is still swinging up and down, and has started to overheat.) 
PARRY: Keep back, it's smoking. 
JAMIE: I told you we shouldn't have touched it. 
PARRY: Yes, turn it off. It's out of control. 
(The projector stops.) 
PARRY: It's taken over. 
DOCTOR: I think not. I think there must be some sort of internal timing mechanism. Jamie, I hope you made those ropes secure. 
JAMIE: Oh, the King of the beasties himself couldnae get out of that one. 
DOCTOR: Good! 
(So the re-energised Controller punches his way out easily.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots sometime. 
CONTROLLER: You will remain still. 
(The Controller transmits strong energy waves through the walls to Toberman.)

[Central chamber]

KLIEG: Stay here and watch that door. At least now we will have some warning. 
CALLUM: What do you two hope to gain from all this? 
KLIEG: That does not concern you. 
(Klieg puts the Cybergun down on the table.) 
KAFTAN: Oh, they might as well know, Eric. We are going to build a better world. 
CALLUM: Better? Well, who for? 
(Toberman approaches Klieg.) 
KLIEG: I told you to watch that door. 
(Toberman hits Klieg with his cyberarm.) 
KAFTAN: Toberman! 
(The Doctor, Jamie, Parry and the Controller enter. It picks up the Cybergun.) 
JAMIE: Victoria! 
VICTORIA: What's going on? 
CONTROLLER: You have done well. 
KAFTAN: Toberman! 
CONTROLLER: Silence. He is now under our control. Open the tombs. 
KAFTAN: No. You have broken your promise. 
CONTROLLER: Cybermen do not promise. Such ideas have no value. Open. 
KAFTAN: No. 
(The Controller looks as if he is going to shoot Kaftan, but opens the hatch instead. As it walks away, Kaftan shuts it again and gets a gun from her bag. She fires.) 
CONTROLLER: That gun will not harm me. 
(Kaftan fires again and the Controller kills her. Then it opens the hatch again. The Doctor goes over to Toberman. The Controller calls down the hatchway.) 
DOCTOR: Look what they've done. You're not like them. You're a man like us. You must help us! He has killed Kaftan! You must help us. 
CONTROLLER: You will report to the surface. 
(Toberman attacks the Controller, and it drops the Cybergun for Jamie to pick up as they struggle. Then Toberman lifts the Controller over his head and throws it onto the control panel in a shower of sparks.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, the hatch! 
(A Cyberman is climbing up the ladder.) 
DOCTOR: The gun, Jamie! 
(Jamie shoots the Cyberman and it expires in a cloud of smoke. He pushes its remains down the ladder.) 
JAMIE: There's another one, Doctor! 
(Jamie fires down the ladder.) 
DOCTOR: Are there any more? 
JAMIE: No, it's gone quiet. I'll close the hatch. 
DOCTOR: No, wait a minute. I'd better go down there. 
VICTORIA: Oh, no, no, not again. 
DOCTOR: It's the only way to make sure. 
JAMIE: Then I'll go with you. 
DOCTOR: No, wait. You stay and look after Victoria. I'll take somebody else. 
(Toberman is cradling Kaftan's body.) 
DOCTOR: Toberman, you see what these creatures have done to you? They've tried to make you like them. Do you understand? They've tried to make you their slave. They just want to use you. They are evil. Think of Kaftan. 
TOBERMAN: Evil! 
DOCTOR: They must be destroyed, do you see? Evil must be destroyed, Now, come! 
TOBERMAN: Destroy! 
DOCTOR: Come! Come on! Come on! 
(Klieg pretends to be unconscious as the Doctor leads Toberman to the hatch then lets him go first.) 
PARRY: Good luck. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
JAMIE: Doctor, the gun. 
DOCTOR: I shan't need that. 
(The Doctor goes down the ladder.) 
JAMIE: He should have taken it. 
VICTORIA: Oh, poor Mister Callum. How are you feeling? 
CALLUM: I can't move my arm. I can't move it. 
(Klieg takes the Cybergun and goes down the hatch while everyone is with Callum.)

[Cavern]

DOCTOR: Move quietly. They're all dormant, see. 
TOBERMAN: Evil! 
(Toberman hits a piece of equipment.) 
DOCTOR: No! Quietly. They're only asleep. They're not frozen yet. Now, you watch them. I have things to do. Now, let me see. 
(The Doctor presses some buttons.) 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
(The Doctor pulls levers.) 
KLIEG: The cryostat! You're freezing them! 
DOCTOR: Klieg! 
(Klieg reverses the levers.) 
DOCTOR: No! No! You'll wake them up! 
KLIEG: That is exactly my intention. You still don't understand, do you? Their Controller is dead. Now I shall control them. They'll do what I say. You see, Doctor, yours is the privilege to witness for the first time the union between mass power and my absolute intelligence. Who's that? Come out. Come out or I shall kill this man. 
(Jamie enters.) 
KLIEG: It's you. Over to that wall, all of you. All of you! Now. 
DOCTOR: Yes, as you say, such a combination between intelligence and power would make you formidable indeed. Why you'd be commander of the universe with your brilliance! It makes the imagination reel with the possibilities! 
KLIEG: Why, Doctor, if I had only known you shared my imagination, you might even have worked for me. 
DOCTOR: Perhaps it's not too late? 
JAMIE: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie, don't you see? 
(The Cybermen are waking but Klieg has his back to them.) 
DOCTOR: Don't you see what this is going to all mean to all the people who come to serve Klieg the All Powerful? Why, no country, no person would dare to have a single thought that was not your own. Eric Klieg's own conception of the, of the way of life! 
KLIEG: Brilliant! Yes, yes, you're right. Master of the world. 
DOCTOR: Well now I know you're mad. I just wanted to make sure.

[Central chamber]

HOPPER: Well, the fuel system's okay. We can blast off any time. 
PARRY: All right. 
HOPPER: Hey, what gives? Well, where is everybody? 
PARRY: Down there. And so are Klieg and the Cybermen. 
HOPPER: Well, I hope they know what they're doing. I've been down there once and I don't reckon to go again. 
VICTORIA: That's all right, Captain. It's comforting to know that we have your superior strength to call on, should we need it.

[Cavern]

KLIEG: And so you have forfeited your right to survival. I shall make an example of you to all who question my intelligence, and the supreme power of the Cybermen. 
DOCTOR: You know, I've heard all this before somewhere. 
JAMIE: You know your trouble? You talk too much. 
KLIEG: Oh, you're stupid. You still think that your puny minds can survive against us? You're decadent, weak. Do you know that? Weak! 
DOCTOR: All right. Go ahead, kill us. 
KLIEG: No, I have a better idea. Much better idea. I shall leave you to the Cybermen. I'm sure they'll have some use for you. Or parts of you. 
(A Cyberman grabs Klieg and beats him to death, then goes to the control panel. Toberman tackles him.) 
DOCTOR: Quick Jamie. These two levers together. 
JAMIE: I can't shift this one. 
DOCTOR: What? You've got to trip that first. 
(The Cyberman and Toberman are evenly matched. Finally Toberman gets it on its back and smashes open the chest unit. Foam oozes out.) 
DOCTOR: Last time they were frozen for five centuries. This time it must be forever. 
(The Doctor and Jamie leave as the remaining Cybermen finish sealing themselves in their tombs and the ice covers the cavern walls again.)

[Central chamber]

VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Here we are, Victoria, safe and sound. Close the hatch. 
(The hatch closes.) 
DOCTOR: There we are. Now then. Now, the best thing about a machine that makes sense, you can very easily make it turn out nonsense. 
(The Doctor adjusts the wiring in the main panel that Callum had opened.)
DOCTOR: There we are. Now I think you'd better all go outside. 
PARRY: Why, what are you going to do, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I'm going to re-electrify the main doors. 
PARRY: Yes? 
DOCTOR: Only this time I'm going to include the hatch and the control panel. 
PARRY: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Anyone touching any of them will get a considerable shock. In fact, a fatal one. 
PARRY: I see. 
DOCTOR: Now, everyone outside. And please take him with you, I shall be glad to see him outside. 
VICTORIA: Jamie? 
JAMIE: No, I'll stay with the Doctor. 
VICTORIA: Oh, all right. 
(Everyone leaves as the Controller's hand moves.) 
DOCTOR: There we are. That's done. Now, we just have to close the main doors and the circuit is complete. 
JAMIE: Oh, thank goodness for that. 
(They check the hatch is firmly closed.) 
JAMIE: Doctor. Doctor! 
(The Controller is back on its feet.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, you go that way, I'll go this way. That way will give us more of a chance. When I say run, run. 
(They start to circle the table.) 
DOCTOR: Run! 
(The Controller tries to grab the Doctor as Jamie runs behind it to the main doors with the Doctor right behind.)

[Tomb entrance]

(Jamie and the Doctor start to push the metal doors closed.) 
DOCTOR: Quickly. Wait! Stop! 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: We'll get a shock. We must find something to insulate. I know, that shoring timber over there! Hurry up! Hurry up, he's coming! 
(Jamie comes back with the wood to push the doors shut as a Cybermat scuttles out between their feet.) 
JAMIE: Okay, Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Quickly! We must keep him inside or else all our work'll be wasted. 
JAMIE: I can't hold mine. Come on! 
DOCTOR: You must do! 
(Toberman pushes them aside and pits his strength against that of the Controller trying to push the doors open.) 
JAMIE: Toberman! 
CONTROLLER: We must survive. We must survive. 
TOBERMAN: You are evil! 
(The doors start to close.) 
DOCTOR: Toberman, come away! 
JAMIE: Careful, you'll get killed, man!

[Central chamber]

TOBERMAN: They shall never pass Toberman. The door is closed. 
(As the metal doors meet fully, electricity burns through the Controller and it falls to the floor, smoking and writhing.)

[Tomb entrance]

(Toberman slides to the ground.) 
PARRY: How terrible. Another life gone. 
HOPPER: Come on, Professor. Blast off in nine minutes. Well, anybody coming along for the ride? 
VICTORIA: We have our own flying machine. 
HOPPER: Flying machine? 
VICTORIA: At least it works. 
HOPPER: Oh, let's go. 
PARRY: Right. Well, goodbye, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Goodbye. 
PARRY: I'm sorry it had to end 
DOCTOR: I know. I know. Goodbye. 
(Hopper and Parry leave.) 
JAMIE: Now, that really is the end of the Cybermen, isn't it? 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. On the other hand, I never like to make predictions. Come along. 
(The Cybermat watches them go.)

[Mountainside]

(High on a mountainside, sheltered by a rocky outcrop, a camp fire glimmers fitfully in the night air. A man cries out. Edward Travers, woken by the cry, sits up quickly.) 
TRAVERS: John? 
(Noticing his companion's empty sleeping bag, Travers takes his rifle and moves towards the sound.) 
TRAVERS: John, where are you? 
(Another scream. Travers back away in fear then turns and stumbles into the night. An enormous shadow falls across the campsite and an object is tossed to the ground - Travers' rifle, twisted beyond recognition.)

[Tardis]

(The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria are gathered in front of the scanner screen.) 
DOCTOR: I don't believe it. Marvellous. After all this time. 
JAMIE: Oh, what's so marvellous about that? 
DOCTOR: Well, don't you see, Jamie? It's the Himalayas. And I do believe we're in exactly the right. Now, wait a minute. 
JAMIE: The Hima - what? 
DOCTOR: Shush. Shush. 
VICTORIA: The Himalayas, Jamie. They're mountains. 
JAMIE: Aye, I can see that. Hey, is it the Earth, Doctor? I don't fancy another tangle down the Cybermen's tomb. 
DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie, shush. Yes, of course it's the Earth. Yes, yes, I think I'm right. Yes. 
JAMIE: Where are these mountains? 
VICTORIA: Don't you know where the Himalayas are? They're in India. Well, at least I think so. 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's it! I knew it, I knew it. It's incredible. Right. Oh no. No, not India. This is Tibet. That's where we are, Tibet. Now, there's no time to be lost. Come along, Jamie, we must find the ghanta. 
JAMIE: The what? 
DOCTOR: The ghanta, the ghanta. I put it here somewhere. Come along, Jamie, help me. 
(The Doctor rummages in a large chest.) 
JAMIE: Hey, what am I supposed to be looking for? 
DOCTOR: I told you it's. Good Lord, I haven't seen that for years. 
JAMIE: Oh, that's the ghanta then? 
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. It's a. Well, whatever it is, it's nice to see it again. 
VICTORIA: Oh. 
(Jamie has found a set of bagpipes.) 
DOCTOR: Thank you. Come along, Victoria. 
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, would you look at these? You never told me you had these. 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Hey. Oh, I could fix those easily. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I was afraid of that. 
VICTORIA: Jamie, you're getting as bad as the Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Come along, help me find the ghanta. 
VICTORIA: It would help us considerably if we knew what we were looking for. 
DOCTOR: Ghanta! 
VICTORIA: But what is it? 
DOCTOR: Oh, what is it? You don't know? Oh, it's a bell. 
VICTORIA: Oh, it's a bell, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Oh, a bell. Oh, well now we know what we're looking for. 
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a Tibetan bell, actually. A holy relic. This one is quite small. It has a dragon on it. As a matter of fact, it has rather an interesting history. It was. Oh. Ah ha, yes, I'll have that. 
The Doctor takes out a huge fur coat.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, it's just the thing for this climate. Now, you might as well find yourselves something while you're about it. How do I look? 
VICTORIA: Doctor, you look beautiful. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I thought I might. I think I'll go and have a scout around. Now, you two find the bell. It's very important. 
VICTORIA: Oh, but why do you want it? 
DOCTOR: Because down there it's going to guarantee us the welcome of a lifetime. 
VICTORIA: Down there? 
(The Doctor goes outside.) 
JAMIE: Oh, don't ask me. When you've been with the Doctor as long as I have, you begin to realise you don't know what he's talking about. We'd better find this bell of his. 
VICTORIA: Oh, wait a minute, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Hey, come and give us a hand. 
VICTORIA: I want to see where the Doctor's gone. Now if I turn this to the left it should. Ah ha that's it. 
(Jamie takes a scimitar from the chest.) 
JAMIE: Hey, now would you look at this. Oh, that's marvellous. What. Hey, what's that? 
VICTORIA: Where? 
JAMIE: A great sort of hairy beastie. Turn the thing back. 
VICTORIA: Oh. 
JAMIE: No, to the right. 
VICTORIA: I am. 
JAMIE: Downwards. That's it, there. 
(A large fur covered figure looms up on the screen.) 
JAMIE: Oh no, my mistake. The great hairy beastie, it's the Doctor.

[Mountainside]

(The Doctor clambers over a crest and gets a spectacular view of some buildings nestling in the valley below.) 
DOCTOR: Yes. Ah, yes.

[Tardis]

(Jamie has found a drawstring bag labelled Ghanta of Detsen Monastery.) 
VICTORIA: A monastery. 
JAMIE: Aye, that'll be where he's gone. 
VICTORIA: I wonder why he wouldn't take us? 
JAMIE: You can never tell with the Doctor. Hey, just thought. Do they let lasses into monasteries? 
VICTORIA: I don't know. Oh, don't say that. 
JAMIE: Oh, never mind. I suppose he'll manage somehow. 
VICTORIA: Hey, shall we open it? 
JAMIE: I don't think so. The Doctor might not like it.

[Mountainside]

(Making his way back to the Tardis, the Doctor notices something on the ground. He bends down to examine a vast footprint. From some way off, a shaggy figure is watching from behind a tree. It disappears as the Doctor stands up again.)

[Tardis]

VICTORIA: Apart from climbing boots, I really think you ought to wear something warm. 
JAMIE: I tell you, I'm a Highlander. The cold doesn't affect me. 
VICTORIA: There's a great deal of difference between the Highlands and the Himalayas, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Aye, they're bigger. 
(The Doctor enters.) 
VICTORIA: Oh, there you are, Doctor. I found this bell thing you were looking for. 
DOCTOR: Oh, splendid, splendid. 
VICTORIA: Is the monastery far? Can we come too? 
DOCTOR: Yes. No. One thing at a time, Victoria. We must find this ghanta. 
VICTORIA: Oh, here. 
DOCTOR: Hmm? Ah. Hmm. 
VICTORIA: Is this where we're going, Detsen? 
DOCTOR: Detsen, yes, that's the name of the monastery, but I'm afraid you're not going. Well, not yet a while anyway. 
VICTORIA: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: No, I think it'd be better if I went alone. 
JAMIE: You've seen something haven't you? Would it not be better I went with you? 
VICTORIA: Is there something dangerous then, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Oh, good heavens, no. No, there's nothing for you to worry about. Now, you stay here with Jamie, inside, and I'll be as quick as I can. 
VICTORIA: Oh, er, Doctor? 
(Victoria holds out the bag.) 
DOCTOR: Oh. I nearly forgot it.

[Mountainside]

(A trail of large footprints leads across the rocky terrain and into the trees where the same large hairy figure stands staring down onto the path. The Doctor approaches. He stops and looks around him, then carries on.)

[Tardis]

VICTORIA: Oh, I'm getting bored. Let's go outside. 
JAMIE: No, I don't think we should. 
VICTORIA: All right, I'll go by myself. 
JAMIE: Oh no, you won't. You won't leave me here by myself. 
VICTORIA: Oh come on. We needn't be long. 
JAMIE: Aye, well, just a quick look then.

[Mountainside]

(The Doctor finds Travers' deserted campsite.) 
DOCTOR: Anybody here? 
(He finds the mangled rifle, then behind a rock, a dead man.) 
(Outside the Tardis, Victoria is sight-seeing whilst wearing plus-fours and a tweed jacket.) 
JAMIE: What can you see? 
VICTORIA: Come on, it's a marvellous view. 
JAMIE: Aye, so it is. Now, come away back. 
VICTORIA: Why? 
JAMIE: Because the Doctor said that, Well if you must know, I am cold. 
VICTORIA: Didn't I tell you? Now why don't you go and get that coat? 
JAMIE: Because I'm not leaving you out here on your own, and that's final. 
VICTORIA: Jamie, look. 
JAMIE: What is it? 
VICTORIA: Footprints. Look at the size of them. Something's been walking round the Tardis. What could it be, Jamie, a bear? 
JAMIE: Whatever it is, it's pretty big. We'd better get inside. 
VICTORIA: I'd like to find out what it is first. Wouldn't you? 
JAMIE: Look, we must be careful. This could be dangerous. Wait while I get that sword.

[Monastery gate]

(The Doctor approaches the gate set in the monastery wall. He is carrying Travers' rucksack. He knocks. He knocks again.) 
DOCTOR: Hello there? 
(No sound but the wind. The Doctor knocks again then pushes at the small wicket gate, which creaks open.)

[Courtyard]

(It is deserted. Cloisters run down one side and doors leading to the interior. At the far end is a statue of Buddha, on a plinth. The Doctor walks over to it. Then he tries one of the doors, but it is locked.) 
DOCTOR: Hello? Where is everybody? 
(He turns around to see a small band of warrior monks with swords drawn. The gate is closing behind them. A bearded European with bandaged head is with them.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, there you are. I thought, I thought for one moment. 
KHRISONG: (warrior leader) What do you want here? 
DOCTOR: I've come to 
TRAVERS: Look! He's got my rucksack. 
DOCTOR: Oh, that. Oh. 
TRAVERS: You murderous devil. 
KHRISONG: Who is this man? 
TRAVERS: I don't know, but this is mine all right. 
THOMNI: (young monk) But you said it was 
KHRISONG: Be silent. You said it was a beast that attacked you. 
TRAVERS: Yes, but it was dark, remember. All I could see was a vague shape, but I felt its hair. Well it's quite obvious now it's this coat he's wearing. 
KHRISONG: Why did you attack this man? 
DOCTOR: Me? I haven't attacked anyone. I found the haversack on the mountain. 
TRAVERS: He's lying. 
DOCTOR: I also found a dead man. 
TRAVERS: Yes, and you killed him. 
KHRISONG: Enough. Seize him. 
DOCTOR: But you can't possibly 
KHRISONG: Silence. This man accuses you of one crime, but there have been many others. If you are responsible, be sure you will be punished. Take him away. 
DOCTOR: But this is ridiculous. Why don't you listen to me? Where are you taking me? 
TRAVERS: Watch him carefully, Khrisong. He's dangerous. 
KHRISONG: This is possible. 
THOMNI: We do not know he is the attacker. 
TRAVERS: Of course he is. I've just said he's so. 
THOMNI: Why then did he come here? 
KHRISONG: That also we shall discover.

[Cell]

(The Doctor is thrown into a small stone cell with high windows and a straw bed.) 
DOCTOR: The welcome of a life time?

[Mountainside]

(Just below the peak, Victoria and Jamie see tracks leading in and out.) 
VICTORIA: Jamie, look. 
JAMIE: Aye, that'll be where the beastie lives, right enough. And it's as far as we're going. 
VICTORIA: Oh, we can't turn back now. 
JAMIE: We can and we will. It could be dangerous. 
VICTORIA: How do you know? It may be quite harmless. 
JAMIE: With feet that size? 
VICTORIA: Well just a quick look inside. 
JAMIE: Look, if that animal is dangerous we could be walking into a trap. 
VICTORIA: Oh, but Jamie. 
JAMIE: No, we're going back. I mean it. 
VICTORIA: Jamie. Look. 
JAMIE: Hey. Wait a minute. 
VICTORIA: Well, what is it? 
JAMIE: Look there, just inside the cave. 
VICTORIA: Where? I can't see anything.

[Cave]

JAMIE: It looks like a beam of wood. 
VICTORIA: Oh it can't be. 
JAMIE: It might not be an animal's den after all. I'm going to take a closer look. 
VICTORIA: Oh but Jamie. 
JAMIE: Look, a wild animal's one thing. I'm not afraid of a man. This is a man's work all right. 
VICTORIA: Oh let's go back, Jamie. Jamie. Jamie! 
JAMIE: Hey, come and a look at this. 
VICTORIA: Jamie, listen. There's something coming. 
JAMIE: Get back. 
(They take cover by the entrance. Outside, two scaly claws move a huge boulder across the opening, shutting them in.)

[Cell]

(The Doctor lies on the bed and looks up at the window. He gets up and tries jumping up to see out of it, but it is too high. Then he tries standing on a stool. Now he can see out. The shutter in his cell door opens.) 
TRAVERS: It's a hundred foot drop outside that window. There's no way out, you know. 
DOCTOR: I didn't think there would be. 
TRAVERS: How did you track me down? 
DOCTOR: Track you down? I don't even know who you are. 
TRAVERS: Don't play the innocent with me. It won't work. If it wasn't for my expedition you wouldn't be here. You're one of those wretched newspaper men. 
DOCTOR: Paper men? I wish I know what you are talking about? 
TRAVERS: Oh, yes. You laughed at me in the press didn't you. Travers, the mad anthropologist. After that, even my own Society wouldn't finance me. But I know they're here. Twenty years I've been searching. 
DOCTOR: Twenty years. 
TRAVERS: I've staked my reputation and every penny I own on this expedition. Now, when I'm close to finding them, you want to steal my glory just for the sake of a cheap headline. 
DOCTOR: Finding them? Finding what? 
TRAVERS: Don't pretend. They're here, somewhere on these mountains. 
DOCTOR: What are?. 
TRAVERS: You know. The Yeti. The Abominable Snowmen.

[Cave]

(Jamie is trying to move the boulder.) 
JAMIE: Oh, it's not use, I can't shift it. Perhaps there's another way out of here. I'm going to see what's down there. 
VICTORIA: Oh, no, don't. There may be more of them. 
JAMIE: Aye, there might. That's why I want you to stay here. 
VICTORIA: Oh no. 
JAMIE: Look, you're safe enough for the moment. If you need me just yell your head off. 
VICTORIA: Don't worry, I will!

[Cell]

DOCTOR: But it could have been the Yeti that attacked you. 
TRAVERS: Rubbish. The Yeti are timid creatures. They're shy. 
DOCTOR: But 
TRAVERS: They're afraid of men. 
DOCTOR: Why me? Why say I did it? 
TRAVERS: You want a clear field, don't you. I discovered the Yeti. The honour's mine, but you want to take it from me. Why, you even murdered my companion just to get a cheap story for your newspaper. 
DOCTOR: That is ridiculous. 
TRAVERS: Is it? 
DOCTOR: Whoever killed your friend had enormous strength. 
TRAVERS: Yes? 
DOCTOR: Well, could I have done it? Well, could I? 
TRAVERS: I'm not going to discuss it any further. There's work to be done. The expedition must go on. Khrisong will find out the truth. 
DOCTOR: Travers. Travers, come back!

[Courtyard]

KHRISONG: We have the word of the Englishman, Travers. 
THOMNI: But how do we know he is telling the truth? 
KHRISONG: Why should he lie? In any case, I am not so concerned with the death of Travers's companion. Four of our brothers have been slaughtered. That is my concern. 
RINCHEN: (a lama) Had we not agreed that the Yeti were responsible? 
KHRISONG: True, Rinchen. But have we not also wondered why? They were so rarely seen. Timid. Then, suddenly, they become savage. Did we not wonder why? Did we not wonder what or whom had brought this change. And now, here is this stranger and Travers accuses him. He may be the cause. I ask you again, let me put it to the truth. Now. 
RINCHEN: You are asking us to condemn a man to certain death. 
KHRISONG: I am Chief Warrior. Is it not my duty to protect you? 
RINCHEN: But not by taking a man's life. 
KHRISONG: Yes, if it is necessary. 
SAPAN: (a lama) No. Only the Abbot can decide. Songsten alone can approve such measures. 
(A gong sounds.) 
RINCHEN: It is time for prayer, my brothers. 
(The lamas go to the cloisters. Chanting starts.) 
KHRISONG: Wait! We must decide now. 
SAPAN: No, Khrisong. After our meditations we will consult the Abbot. 
KHRISONG: This is foolishness. Time will be wasted. Do they wish more of our brothers to die before I'm allowed to take action. 
THOMNI: There is no other way. 
KHRISONG: There is, for me. Let them meditate. Let them consult. I, Khrisong, will act. Bring me the prisoner.

[Cave]

(Jamie follow a tunnel into a circular chamber with a wooden prop supporting the entrance. It is not very strong, and some small rocks fall when Jamie nudges it. In the middle of the chamber is a pyramid of six inch silver spheres.) 
VICTORIA [OC]: Jamie, Jamie! It's coming back. 
JAMIE: Get back in there. 
VICTORIA: Oh, is it safe? 
JAMIE: Aye. Now go on. 
(Jamie pushes Victoria towards the chamber as the boulder is taken from the entrance. A huge, fur covered creature enters on its hind legs.) 
VICTORIA: Jamie, get back! It'll kill you! 
(The creature takes Jamie's sword from him and breaks it in two. Victoria screams.)

Episode Two

(From the Lost in Time DVD)

[Cave]

JAMIE: Keep back, Victoria. I can't stop it. 
(Jamie runs back to the main chamber and pushes at the pit prop.) 
VICTORIA: Jamie, the roof. What are you doing? 
(Jamie grabs another piece of wood.) 
JAMIE: We've got to stop that thing somehow. 
VICTORIA: You'll bury us alive! 
JAMIE: It's our only chance. Now get back. 
(Jamie swings at the pit prop, bringing the tunnel roof down just as the Yeti reaches them. A single claw is sticking up through the rubble.) 
JAMIE: Are you all right? 
VICTORIA: That horrible thing. What was it? 
JAMIE: I don't know. Did you see what it did to my sword, though? Broke it like a piece of wood. No human's as strong as that. 
VICTORIA: What is this place? And what are those? 
JAMIE: Some sort of metal. They're all glowing. 
(Jamie picks up the top-most sphere.) 
VICTORIA: Oh, let's get away from here, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Aye, if we can. I don't think that tunnel's completely blocked. Come on. 
(He puts the sphere in his bag and they walk past the buried Yeti.) 
JAMIE: Oh, don't worry about that, it's quite dead. 
(The claw moves. Victoria looks back and gasps.) 
JAMIE: What's the matter? 
VICTORIA: Look. 
(The Yeti starts to get up.) 
JAMIE: Come on!

[Cell]

(The DOCTOR plays 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' on his recorder. Thomni enters.) 
THOMNI: Come. 
DOCTOR: Ah, and about time too. Come to release me, have you? 
THOMNI: No, sir. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, well, first things first. What's your name? 
THOMNI: Thomni. You must come with me. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I see, Thomni. After we've had a little chat. 
THOMNI: Khrisong will be waiting. 
DOCTOR: No, no. Just wait. No one seems to want to listen to me and everyone is jumping to the wrong conclusions. Now, you seem to be a reasonable sort of chap. What's going on here? 
THOMNI: We are besieged. The Yeti have turned upon us. At least, that is what we thought until 
DOCTOR: Until I turned up. I see. Every time I visit Detsen the monastery seems to be in some sort of trouble or another. 
THOMNI: You have been here before? 
DOCTOR: That attack in 1630, what was the outcome? 
THOMNI: You know something of our history. 
DOCTOR: Yes, a little. 
THOMNI: Ah, that was also a dark period. It was then our holy Ghana was taken from us. 
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. Never mind, I'm sure it'll turn up again. 
THOMNI: Legend tells us so, but after so 
DOCTOR: This chap Travers. This chap Travers, what of him? 
THOMNI: Sir, there is no time to talk, Khrisong will be angry. 
DOCTOR: Ah yes, he may be angry, but he's not the Abbot, is he? 
THOMNI: No. 
DOCTOR: No. I don't think you'll find the Abbot will be angry when he sees what I've bought with me. 
THOMNI: What do you mean? Show me. 
DOCTOR: I want you to help me to get this to the Abbot. 
(The Doctor reaches into the straw bed, then stands suddenly when Khrisong and his guards enter .) 
KHRISONG: Why this delay? Seize him. Take him to the gate. 
(The guards take the Doctor out.) 
DOCTOR: Abbot. The straw.

[Corridor]

KHRISONG: Follow me. 
(The Doctor is led away. Khrisong follows, them Thomni. But he pauses and returns to the cell. Thomni finds the bag under the straw mattress and takes out the bell. Reverently, he kneels, places the bell on the bed and prays.)

[Mountainside]

(Jamie and Victoria are running down the slope with the Yeti behind them.) 
JAMIE: Victoria, the Tardis is that way. 
VICTORIA: I know, but we must warn the Doctor. 
JAMIE: How can we? We don't know where he is? 
VICTORIA: Jamie! 
JAMIE: Run!

[Courtyard]

RINCHEN: Khrisong. Khrisong. 
KHRISONG: Do not interfere, Rinchen. 
RINCHEN: Did we not decide we would consult the Abbot, Songsten, before taking action? 
KHRISONG: We? You mean you had decided. The time for talk is past. 
RINCHEN: But, Khrisong, the Abbot must 
KHRISONG: The Abbot. Must I always consult the Abbot before I take decisive action? 
DOCTOR: Travers, don't you think this has gone far enough? 
TRAVERS: Well, there's nothing I can do. 
DOCTOR: What do you hope to gain? 
TRAVERS: Time. 
DOCTOR: Time? 
TRAVERS: Look, you killed my companion, left me single handed, but don't worry, you won't get another chance of getting in my way. I shall find the Yeti, with or without help. 
DOCTOR: You can't possibly leave 
TRAVERS: Can't I? You'll be quite safe here and I know where you are. I'm going. Now, don't worry. The monks won't harm you. They're men of peace. 
DOCTOR: Men of peace? 
RINCHEN: You are asking us 
(Travers bows to Rinchen, Khrisong and Sapan, and leaves.) 
RINCHEN: You are asking us to agree to murder. 
KHRISONG: No. Our hands will be clean. 
SAPAN: After deliberately using him as bait? You cannot be so ruthless. 
KHRISONG: Sapan, I believe that this man is, for some reason, trying to turn the Yeti into savage creatures. 
SAPAN: But what proof is there? 
KHRISONG: You heard the word of Travers. He's an Englishman, a stranger. He's a killer. Let me tie him to the gate. If the Yeti come to rescue him, we will know the truth, and my warriors will be waiting. 
SAPAN: But if he is innocent? 
KHRISONG: My warriors will protect him. 
RINCHEN: Khrisong, there may be wisdom in what you say. All we ask is that you wait until the 
KHRISONG: No. I have done with waiting. Bring him to the gate. 
(The Doctor is taken outside the monastery.)

[Sanctum]

(Thomni is reverently carrying the bell when the inner door opens. He quickly prostrates himself as a man in a white shawl comes out.) 
THOMNI: Master Abbot. (getting up) Abbot Songsten. Forgive me, Abbot. 
SONGSTEN: Thomni. 
THOMNI: I'm sorry, but 
SONGSTEN: You know well that only I may enter here. What is this? 
(Songsten takes the Ghanta.) 
SONGSTEN: Where did you get this? 
THOMNI: Is it not the Ghanta that was lost? 
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: (a gentle, saintly voice) It is, my son. 
(The monks fall to their knees.) 
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: Two hundred years or more it has been lost to us. How came you by it? 
SONGSTEN: It is the Master, Padmasambhava. Do not be afraid. Answer him. 
THOMNI: A stranger brought it, Master. 
VOICE [OC]: (harsh and rasping) The Doctor. So. He has returned. 
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: Bring the Ghanta to me, my son. 
(Songsten gives Thomni the Ghanta and opens the inner sanctum doors.) 
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: Both of you. Do not be afraid, Thomni.

[Monastery gate]

(The Doctor's hand are tied above his head.) 
KHRISONG: Rapalchan, watch from the window there. Kheda, you, the other window. Any attempt to rescue you will now be highly dangerous for you. 
DOCTOR: Look, nobody is going to rescue me, least of all an abominable snowman. And hasn't it occurred to you, that innocent or guilty, whatever's been killing your monks might very well kill me. 
KHRISONG: If you are innocent, then let us hope that we will have the time to rescue you.

[Mountainside]

JAMIE: I think we've shaken it off. 
VICTORIA: Have we? Oh, good. 
JAMIE: Come on. It can't be much further. Listen. 
VICTORIA: Now what is it? 
JAMIE: Something's coming. Come on. 
(They hide behind a outcrop as Travers comes up the slope. He points his rifle at them.) 
TRAVERS: Here, who the devil are you? What are you doing here? 
JAMIE: We're on our way to the monastery. 
TRAVERS: Are you indeed? You're a strange pair to find roaming round these mountains. You aren't anything to do with that newspaper fellow, I suppose? 
JAMIE: What do you mean? 
TRAVERS: Well, he says he's a Doctor, but I know what he's really after. 
VICTORIA: Oh, have you seen him? 
TRAVERS: Oh yes, I've seen him. 
JAMIE: Is he all right? 
TRAVERS: Oh yes, he's quite all right. So, you're going to the monastery, are you? Good. I think you'll find those lamas have quite a welcome waiting for you. 
VICTORIA: The Doctor said there would be. 
TRAVERS: Did he now? 
JAMIE: Oh, I wouldn't go that way if I was you. 
TRAVERS: Wouldn't you? 
VICTORIA: There's something up there. 
JAMIE: Aye, a great hairy beastie. 
TRAVERS: Where? 
JAMIE: In a cave. 
TRAVERS: A cave? Have you found their cave? 
JAMIE: Aye. 
TRAVERS: Will you show me where it is? 
VICTORIA: Oh, no. 
JAMIE: No, I couldn't go back there, not with Victoria. 
TRAVERS: Now look here, young fellow, do stop playing games with me. I know that you and that Doctor fellow are after the Yeti. 
VICTORIA: Yeti? What's he talking about? 
TRAVERS: Are you trying to tell me you're not part of some press expedition? 
JAMIE: Expedition? 
VICTORIA: We're not part of anything. We're just visiting the monastery. 
TRAVERS: But the cave. 
JAMIE: Look, if you're that keen to tangle with that beastie I'll show you where the cave is. 
TRAVERS: You will? 
JAMIE: After you've shown us how to get to the monastery. 
TRAVERS: All right. I've nothing to lose, I suppose. All right, come with me.

[Inner sanctum]

(Two burning lamps are either side of plain closed doors.) 
PADMASAMBHAVA: Tell me, my son. Is the Doctor alone? 
THOMNI: Yes, Master. 
PADMASAMBHAVA: We are grateful for the return of the holy Ghanta. The Doctor is our friend. He must be treated with respect and kindness. Thomni, you will go to Khrisong. Tell him the Abbot orders the release of the Doctor. Go now. Remember, these words were spoken by the Abbot here. You will forget that you have entered this room or that you have spoken to me. 
(Thonmi walks slowly out and pulls the doors shut.) 
VOICE [OC]: Therefore, Songsten, we must make certain that Doctor learns nothing of what is happening. He is a man of great knowledge and intelligence, but he may not show sympathy for the powers that guide us. He may even seek to hinder the Great Plan. 
PADMASAMBHAVA: It might be wise if he departs as soon as possible.

[Monastery gate]

(Up at the window, the guards see movement.) 
RALPACHAN: Khidom. In the rocks. Did you see something? Something is coming. Khrisong, the Yeti. The Yeti! 
DOCTOR: Oh no. 
KHRISONG [OC]: Be ready to kill them. 
(Travers, Jamie and Victoria come around a rocky outcrop.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie! Victoria! Keep back! 
VICTORIA: Oh, look! 
DOCTOR: Keep back! They'll kill you! 
(The three run down to the monastery.) 
DOCTOR: Keep away! Get away! 
(Khrisong and his guards come out.) 
KHRISONG: You see? I was right. 
TRAVERS: Khrisong! Khrisong, it was all a mistake. 
JAMIE: Doctor. 
TRAVERS: I've been talking to these youngsters. I'm sorry. This is not the man that attacked me. 
KHRISONG: Seize them. 
JAMIE: Hey, what's going on? 
DOCTOR: I told you to keep away. He's lead you into a trap. 
TRAVERS: No, Doctor, believe me. 
KHRISONG: Silence. Who are these people? 
TRAVERS: They're friends of his. 
KHRISONG: Then they shall act as hostages also. 
(Thomni comes out of the monastery.) 
THOMNI: Khrisong. 
KHRISONG: Where have you been? 
THOMNI: With the Abbot. He has given me instructions 
KHRISONG: The Abbot? I gave you no instructions to be with the Abbot.. 
THOMNI: But, Khrisong, we must release him. This stranger has brought back to us the holy Ghanta that was lost. We must treat him with respect and kindness. These are the words of our Abbot. 
KHRISONG: Is this true? 
DOCTOR: Of course. 
KHRISONG: Then why did you not tell me? 
DOCTOR: You'd already accused me of murder. You were hardly in the right frame of mind to listen to my story of how I came by the bell, now where you? Oh please. 
(The Doctor is untied.) 
DOCTOR: This wasn't the welcome I expected, you know. As for you, Travers.

[Inner sanctum]

VOICE [OC]: It is well to remember that nothing must disturb our preparations. There is little time left now. 
SONGSTEN: How, if the Doctor will not go? 
PADMASAMBHAVA: His life could be in great danger. He has been a good friend in the past. It would be ill if the life of such a one became in peril.

[Courtyard]

DOCTOR: You say you found this in the cave? 
JAMIE: Aye. 
VICTORIA: There were lots of them. 
JAMIE: Well, what do you think it is, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I've no idea. Now, this creature, what was it like? 
JAMIE: Oh, it was huge and all covered with hair, like a sort of bear. 
VICTORIA: It attacked us. 
DOCTOR: It does sound like your abominable snowman, Travers. 
TRAVERS: Oh, but they wouldn't attack anyone. 
DOCTOR: No, I always thought so. 
TRAVERS: They're shy, elusive creatures. Why do you think it's taken me so long to track them down? 
DOCTOR: What made this? I wonder what it's for. Oh well. 
(The Doctor puts the sphere on the ground. ) 
DOCTOR: I'd like to see one of these creatures. 
VICTORIA: It was horrible. 
JAMIE: Aye, it was buried under tons of rock, yet it still just got up and came after us. 
VICTORIA: Like a nightmare. 
TRAVERS: Now, fear makes us imagine all sorts of things. 
DOCTOR: Including creatures that don't seem to be flesh and blood. 
RALPACHAN [OC]: Khrisong. Khrisong. 
DOCTOR: What is it? 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: What's the matter? 
RALPACHAN [OC]: Khrisong! 
JAMIE: What's he seen? 
RALPACHAN [OC]: Khrisong, come quickly. 
KHRISONG: What is it? 
JAMIE: He must have seen something. 
RALPACHAN [OC]: Look. 
(There are three Yetis on the mountainside.) 
TRAVERS: There they are at last. 
JAMIE: Hey, yes. 
TRAVERS: After all these years. 
KHRISONG: Ralpachan, stand watch at the walls. Pletu, I want two men either side of this base. Thomni, come with me. 
TRAVERS: Look. They're magnificent. Just as I thought they'd be. 
DOCTOR: Do you really think they'll attack? 
KHRISONG: I don't know. They have never been this close before. 
TRAVERS: Of course they wouldn't attack anyone. They're timid. You'll see. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but if they do, do you think you could capture one? I would like to examine one. 
JAMIE: Examine it? Aye, we'll wrap it up for you. 
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jamie. 
KHRISONG: Thomni, come. We must see to the defences. Boy, help at the gates. 
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, if you really want to capture one of these beasties, I think I have an idea which might just work. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Victoria? 
JAMIE: Eh? 
DOCTOR: Victoria, I think this is one of those instances where discretion is the better part of valour. Jamie has an idea. Come along. 
JAMIE: No, Doctor 
DOCTOR: Come along. 
(The Doctor and Victoria go into the monastery buildings.)

[Meeting room]

SONGSTEN: Have no fear. Now that the holy Ghanta has been returned to us, all will be well. 
RINCHEN: But what if the Yeti do attack? 
SONGSTEN: Have faith, Rinchen. Khrisong and his warriors will protect us. 
SAPAN: Khrisong is a rash man. He was so sure that this Doctor was a threat to us. 
DOCTOR: I can assure you I am not.

[Monastery gate]

JAMIE: I hope this is going to work. You ready up there? Catch. 
(JAMIE throws a rope up to a monk above the gate.) 
THOMNI: There is one coming. 
JAMIE: Aye, one's enough. 
THOMNI: The others don't seem to be moving. 
JAMIE: Keep it back. I'm not ready for it yet. 
THOMNI: Keep it back. 
JAMIE: That's it. Stand by, here it comes. (The Yeti arrives) Now! 
(The monks beat the Yeti with their sticks.) 
JAMIE: Right, haul the rope, quick. Quick with the net. Pull hard. Up with it 
(The Yeti is trapped as the monks continue to beat it. Then it suddenly goes limp.) 
JAMIE: Wait, wait. 
THOMNI: It, it's dead. 
JAMIE: Aye. Hey, why aren't the others attacking? 
(The other two Yeti go back up the mountain.) 
THOMNI: They're going. 
JAMIE: Good. Let's get this one inside. 
(As they try to drag the big animal inside the monastery, we pan across to a silver globe on the ground nearby. It starts to roll away, making a little noise.)

[Courtyard]

(Evening prayer are going on as a monk walks across with a flaming torch. He sees something glinting by the base Buddha. He picks up the sphere, looks at it, then puts it down again.)

[Meeting room]

(The Yeti is laid out on a table.) 
DOCTOR: You were right about one thing, Victoria. This creature certainly doesn't seem to be flesh and blood. 
TRAVERS: What? 
DOCTOR: It's not your abominable snowman either, Travers. Look. 
(The Doctor hits the Yeti.) 
DOCTOR: It's metal. 
TRAVERS: That's incredible. 
THOMNI: What is it? 
KHRISONG: A devil's warrior. 
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so. It's more like a robot. 
TRAVERS: A robot? My dear chap, don't let your imagination run away with you. 
DOCTOR: Now, why has it stopped? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. 
(The Doctor rolls back a flap of fur to find an empty circular hole.) 
VICTORIA: Nothing there. 
DOCTOR: No, but there has been. 
(The sphere outside the gate is still beeping and stuck in the mud. Meanwhile, the one by the Buddha starts beeping and rolling too.)

Episode Three

[Meeting room]

DOCTOR: Jamie, when you captured this creature, you must have dislodged it's control unit. 
JAMIE: Then it must still be lying out there. 
DOCTOR: Precisely. 
KHRISONG: Where are you going? 
DOCTOR: To have a look outside the gates. I want that unit. Come on, Jamie. 
KHRISONG: No. I will not allow it. 
DOCTOR: But why not? 
KHRISONG: I trust no one to leave the monastery. You say this creature is not a real Yeti. 
TRAVERS: It's metal. It's been made. 
KHRISONG: And sent against us. Why? Why does someone wish harm to the monks of Detsen. I will trust no stranger until these questions are answered. 
JAMIE: Oh, but we're on your side. Have we not convinced you yet? 
KHRISONG: I am convinced of nothing. 
VICTORIA: The Doctor knows all about this sort of thing. Why not let him help you? 
DOCTOR: Well if you don't trust us at least send Thomni, or one of your other warriors. 
KHRISONG: No. I will not allow the gates to be opened. 
DOCTOR: If you want us to help you. 
KHRISONG: I do not need your help. Thomni, guard them. 
(Khrisong leaves.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. A very obstinate man. 
TRAVERS: Yes, well, that's that I suppose. Nothing we can do about it now. Well I'll just go and get a bit of shut-eye. Good night all.

[Courtyard]

KHRISONG: Ralpachan. 
RALPACHAN: Yes, Khrisong. 
KHRISONG: Stand guard at the gate. No one is to leave the monastery. Be watchful, these Yeti are more dangerous than we thought. 
TRAVERS: Khrisong. 
KHRISONG: What is it? What do you want? 
TRAVERS: Er, I want a word with you. 
KHRISONG: Well? 
TRAVERS: Alone. 
(Ralpachan goes to the gate.) 
KHRISONG: Yes? 
TRAVERS: Look, I've been thinking. Now that we've found out that these abominable snowmen are mechanical things. 
KHRISONG: Well? 
TRAVERS: Don't you see? It means that I'm right. The real Yeti are there, hiding up there somewhere in those mountains. 
KHRISONG: This is no concern of mine. 
TRAVERS: No, but Khrisong, wait. I want to go out there after them. 
KHRISONG: That would be foolishness. 
TRAVERS: Look, I've always said that the real Yeti are harmless. Now I must find out for sure, otherwise the whole point of my expedition will be lost. 
KHRISONG: And those devil creatures would kill you. 
TRAVERS: Yes, well, that's a chance I'll have to take. 
KHRISONG: No. I will not allow it. 
TRAVERS: But don't you see? The real Yeti may be killed by these robots. Look, I must go. 
KHRISONG: No, I forbid it. 
TRAVERS: Look, I'm not one of your monks, you know? You can't give me orders. 
KHRISONG: No. I have said that no one will leave. Anyone may be controlling these monsters. Even you. 
TRAVERS: Oh, that's ridiculous. 
KHRISONG: I have given my orders. Obey them.

[Meeting room]

THOMNI: Sir, I have no choice. I must obey Khrisong. 
JAMIE: Do you not realise the man's a wee bit daffy? 
DOCTOR: Oh I wouldn't say that, Jamie. He's just doing his duty as he sees it. 
THOMNI: But I think he is mistaken not to trust you. There is much sense in what you say. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you, Thomni. 
VICTORIA: Doctor? Come here a moment. 
DOCTOR: What is it? 
VICTORIA: The place you said where the control unit would go, it's round. 
DOCTOR: Yes? 
VICTORIA: Well I wonder if? Jamie, you remember in that cave, we found that sphere. Well, don't you think it could go. 
JAMIE: Hey, yes. I believe you're right. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but I've thought of that. But the thing was as light as a feather. There couldn't have been anything inside it. Unless. Where is it? 
JAMIE: Why, I gave it to you. You were looking at it. 
DOCTOR: I remember. I put it down somewhere. 
VICTORIA: The Buddha. The Buddha in the courtyard. 
DOCTOR: The Buddha. I put it down by the Buddha. Oh now, please, Thomni. Please. 
(Thomni lets them leave.)

[Courtyard]

JAMIE: It's not here, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: But I swear I put it down here by the Buddha. 
JAMIE: Aye, well, it's not here now. 
VICTORIA: Somebody must have picked it up. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear. 
VICTORIA: Maybe that guard's taken it. 
JAMIE: Aye, let's ask him. 
(As they walk towards the gate, the sphere rolls towards the cloisters.) 
DOCTOR: No, tact, Jamie. I'll handle this. Hello, guard. good evening. I wonder if you can help us. I left a silver sphere by the Buddha there. 
RALPACHAN: Sphere? 
VICTORIA: It's a shiny round thing. 
THOMNI: It's most important. Have you taken it? 
RALPACHAN: No, and if anyone had I should have seen them. 
THOMNI: Ralpachan, who has passed through the courtyard? 
RALPACHAN: Master Khrisong, but he touched nothing. 
JAMIE: No one else? 
RALPACHAN: The Englishman, Travers. 
DOCTOR: Travers? Are you sure he didn't pick it up? 
RALPACHAN: I am sure. He spoke only to Khrisong and now he is gone. 
DOCTOR: Gone? 
RALPACHAN: He said Khrisong had given him permission to leave. 
DOCTOR: But that's impossible. 
THOMNI: He has tricked you. 
JAMIE: Aye, he must have taken it. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but why? 
VICTORIA: Could he be the one that's doing it? 
DOCTOR: I wonder. Are you sure he didn't take the sphere with him? 
RALPACHAN: He took nothing. 
JAMIE: I'll find his room and search it. 
DOCTOR: Right, Jamie. 
THOMNI: We must tell Khrisong what has happened. 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Travers. I can't believe he has anything to do with these robots. 
VICTORIA: One thing's for certain. It couldn't have moved on its own.

[Meeting room]

(The sphere is heading here, where a wooden framework has been built around the Yeti.) 
SAPAN: How if the devil should breath life into it again? 
RINCHEN: My ghost trap will ward off the evil spirits. 
SAPAN: Hmm. But to fetter it with chains is also wise. The strangers say that this creature is not flesh and blood. 
RINCHEN: How can this be? Does it not move? Strangers? Do not believe them, Sapan. 
SAPAN: But see. 
RINCHEN: It is but armour, such as any warrior would wear. The devil in his guile wears his armour beneath the skin to protect his evil heart. 
SAPAN: Such a being is against nature. It troubles me. Let us go. 
SONGSTEN: What have you been doing, my brothers? 
SAPAN: We have built a spirit trap about the monster, my Abbot. 
SONGSTEN: This is well thought, Sapan. You are wise. 
(Sapan leaves.) 
RINCHEN: You should never have allowed this monster to have been brought into the monastery, Khrisong. 
KHRISONG: What I allow is my affair, Rinchen. 
(Rinchen leaves.) 
SONGSTEN: Gently, my son. Gently. 
KHRISONG: I'm sorry, my Abbot. I try to guard my tongue, but Rinchen finds much fault in me of late. 
SONGSTEN: Harsh words are like blunted arrows. It is the truth that makes them sharp. 
KHRISONG: I have tried to do my duty. Under your guidance, the protection of the monastery lies in my hands. 
SONGSTEN: I know, my son. Your task is a hard one. 
KHRISONG: And such is our adversary, that against such creatures that I must protect you. The purpose of my life is nothing if I fail. You know, my Abbot, that I willingly would lay down my life for you and my brothers. But can I combat this with mildness? You must let me fight their strength with my strength. 
SONGSTEN: Our ways are the ways of peace, Khrisong, my son. You, must not seek to change them. 
KHRISONG: I would fight to preserve them. You must let me. There is no other way. 
SONGSTEN: There is. It is merely obscured to our simple minds. I shall seek guidance from the Master, Padmasambhava. 
(The Doctor enters with Victoria and Thomni.) 
DOCTOR: Khrisong. Khrisong, I must speak with you. 
KHRISONG: What is it? 
DOCTOR: Have you given Travers permission to leave the monastery? 
KHRISONG: Of course not. 
DOCTOR: Well, he's gone. 
KHRISONG: How? 
DOCTOR: The guard at the gate said you'd given him permission. 
KHRISONG: Did he? Very well. Come with me. 
DOCTOR: It's about time you let me help you. 
KHRISONG: Help? I want to make sure you don't disappear as well. 
(Khrisong leaves with the Doctor following.) 
VICTORIA: It's the Abbot. Is he all right? 
THOMNI: Oh, yes. He's in a trance. We must leave him now. 
VICTORIA: Trance? 
SONGSTEN: Yes, Master 
VICTORIA: Who's he talking to? 
THOMNI: The Master, Padmasambhava. He's asking for spiritual guidance. 
VICTORIA: How? 
SONGSTEN: I hear you, Master. I am coming. 
(Songsten leaves.) 
VICTORIA: Where's he going? 
THOMNI: To the Holy Sanctum. To Padmasambhava. 
VICTORIA: Let's follow him. 
THOMNI: No, no, no. It is forbidden. No one but the Abbot may enter. No one!

[Courtyard]

KHRISONG: And this should not have happened. I hold you responsible, Ralpachan. 
DOCTOR: Oh well, what's done is done. Ah, Jamie. 
JAMIE: I searched his room, but it's not there. 
DOCTOR: I see. Khrisong, you must see that it is vital that I examine one of these control units. Now, the one that Jamie bought down from the mountains has disappeared. Someone is trying to stop us learning the truth. 
JAMIE: You must let us outside to find the other one. Och, look. 
(Khrisong paces for a moment.) 
KHRISONG: Very well. I will go.

[Inner sanctum]

(There is a small table with a relief map of the monastery and its surrounding area laid out before Padmasambhava's throne. As his claw-like hand moves three miniature Yeti figures into a group, the action is replicated by their full-sized counterparts.)

[Corridor]

(Songsten is followed by Victoria and Thomni.) 
THOMNI: No! No, Miss Victoria, we mustn't. 
VICTORIA: I only want to see where he's going. 
THOMNI: I told you, the Sanctum. No one is allowed to go there. Please, let us go back. 
VICTORIA: You mean to say you've lived here all this time and never been in there. 
THOMNI: Yes. 
VICTORIA: You are funny. Aren't you the tiniest bit curious? 
THOMNI: No. 
VICTORIA: And you've never seen this Master? 
THOMNI: Never. 
VICTORIA: Don't you want to know what he looks like? Oh, sure you do. Come on. 
THOMNI: No, Miss Victoria. Can't you understand it is impossible? 
VICTORIA: I don't see. 
THOMNI: No, you do not. It is forbidden, and I have been brought up in the path of obedience. 
VICTORIA: Very well. 
(Songsten has entered the sanctum.) 
VICTORIA: But I'll get there somehow.

[Monastery gate]

DOCTOR: Hasn't he found it yet? 
JAMIE: No. Khrisong, can I give you a hand? 
KHRISONG: Stay where you are.

[Inner sanctum]

PADMASAMBHAVA: Far better if the Yeti had not been brought into the monastery. 
SONGSTEN: I am sorry, Master. I could not prevent it. 
PADMASAMBHAVA: The Doctor is wise. His eyes are not closed in ignorance. 
SONGSTEN: If he is not ignorant perhaps he might assist you with your plan. 
PADMASAMBHAVA: But his mind is on a complex plane. It is hard to fathom. There is a chance he will oppose what we have to do. 
VOICE [OC]: No. We must continue with the work alone. I must now make sure our plan is imperiled no more. 
(The wizened hand moves two more model Yeti towards the monastery.)

[Monastery gate]

(Khrisong finds the sphere stuck in the mud.) 
KHRISONG: I've found it. 
DOCTOR: Khrisong! Behind you. Yeti. 
(As Khrisong picks up the sphere, it beeps louder and faster, so he drops it again.) 
JAMIE: Come in. 
KHRISONG: No. 
DOCTOR: Don't be a fool. 
(Diving to the ground, Khrisong picks up the sphere again as the Yeti arrive, but he is surrounded.) 
JAMIE: Don't be a fool, they're on top of you. 
(Jamie, Ralpachan and the Doctor run to help Khrisong but the Yeti take the sphere and throw him aside and leave.) 
DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie. Quick, get him inside. They came to get their ball back.

[Inner sanctum]

PADMASAMBHAVA: It would seem that the Yeti have caused some little upset at the gates. However, their work is accomplished. 
(The hand takes the two Yeti from the board.) 
PADMASAMBHAVA: Now, Songsten, observe. These three Yeti are waiting for you. 
(He hands Songsten a small transparent pyramid.) 
PADMASAMBHAVA: Take this pyramid I have prepared. Take it to the caves. Then the Great Intelligence will focus upon this planet. Soon it will begin to grow and at last take on physical form. At last its wanderings in space will be at an end. My work will then be done. Go now, Songsten. Do as I have asked. 
VOICE [OC]: Nothing must interfere.

[Courtyard]

RINCHEN: These creatures are indeed fearsome. 
JAMIE: Aye, you were lucky you weren't killed. 
KHRISONG: But why did they just turn and leave? They had us at their mercy. Why? 
DOCTOR: They didn't come to fight. They came for the sphere. 
JAMIE: Are you sure? 
DOCTOR: Pretty sure. They didn't want me to examine it. 
KHRISONG: You talk of these creatures as if they were human, with a human's brain. 
DOCTOR: That sphere is like a brain. They had to get it back. 
JAMIE: Yes, and that Yeti we caught in the net. Well, that could have been after the sphere we found in the cave. 
DOCTOR: I'd still like to know what happened to that one. 
(It is currently hiding in the shadows as Songsten walks down the corridor. Once he has passed, it continues towards the meeting room.)
DOCTOR: This sound that you heard. 
KHRISONG: It came from the sphere, I swear it. 
JAMIE: Some sort of signal, do you think? 
DOCTOR: Yes, it could be. Anyway, its a help. 
SAPAN: How can this help? 
DOCTOR: Well, with the right sort of equipment, these signals can be tracked. 
JAMIE: You mean you can find out where the Yeti are getting there instructions from? 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. 
RINCHEN: Where can we find such equipment? 
DOCTOR: We've got to back to the Tardis. 
JAMIE: Right. 
KHRISONG: This equipment. You have it? 
DOCTOR: Yes. But it's outside there on the mountain. 
KHRISONG: Then, you must go for it. 
JAMIE: You mean you'll let us go? 
KHRISONG: I have no choice. I have failed. My warriors are powerless. I must trust you. 
DOCTOR: Come on. Let's get me coat.

[Meeting room]

VICTORIA: Oh. Oh, they're not back yet. I think I'll go and find them. No need for you to come. 
THOMNI: I think it would be better if I came with you. 
VICTORIA: Afraid I may go somewhere that I shouldn't? Oh, come on then. I don't want to stay in here with that thing. 
RINCHEN: Thomni, it were well that you went to Khrisong. 
THOMNI: Where is he? 
RINCHEN: In the courtyard. 
THOMNI: I will go to him. Oh, Sapan, would you care for our guest, please? 
VICTORIA: Is Jamie and the Doctor. are they all right? 
SAPAN: Rest easily, my child. 
RINCHEN: They are in 
SAPAN: They are very well. There is no need for this child to worry. Is it not so, Rinchen? 
VICTORIA: You're keeping something from me. 
SAPAN: My child, I have told you nothing but truth. Your friends are busy helping our brothers. 
RINCHEN: Sapan, we have duties to perform. 
SAPAN: True. We must leave you. It might be wiser to join Thomni in the courtyard? Excuse us, please. 
(Victoria is about to follow, but changes her mind and heads for the Sanctum whilst the sphere is also heading for its destination.)
THOMNI: You are not well, Khrisong. You should be resting. 
KHRISONG: There can be no rest for me while this creature is here. 
THOMNI: But it is dead. What harm can it do us now? 
KHRISONG: Even so, wiser to destroy it. Rinchen or the Doctor. Who is right? I do not know any longer. 
(Rinchen brings Victoria in.) 
RINCHEN: Khrisong, you must guard this child. Sapan sent her to you in the courtyard, yet I found her near the Sanctum. 
VICTORIA: I didn't mean any harm. 
RINCHEN: For her own good, it would be safer if she were closely guarded.

[Mountainside]

(The two Yeti which attacked Khrisong head up towards the cave with the sphere, whilst Travers follows at a safe distance.)

[Courtyard]

(Ralpachan is standing guard when he sees movement in the courtyard. He leaves the gates to investigate but finds nothing. When he turns back, Songsten is there. The Abbot waves his hand in front of Ralpachan's face, hypnotising him.) 
SONGSTEN: When I have passed through the gate, you will awake. You have seen nothing. 
(Songsten leaves. Ralpachan wakes and shakes his head.)

[Cell]

VICTORIA: I suppose everyone thinks I'm a nuisance. Is that it? 
THOMNI: We are concerned for your safety, as you well know. 
VICTORIA: You're not really going to lock me up in this beastly room, are you? 
THOMNI: No, I don't think that will be necessary. But you must promise to behave and not cause trouble. 
VICTORIA: What do you mean? 
THOMNI: I think perhaps you are a little too inquisitive, Miss Victoria. 
VICTORIA: Me? I just don't like mysteries. Your Master, for instance, Padma. 
THOMNI: I have told you there are some things that you should not ask. 
VICTORIA: Oh, all right, I'm sorry. All right. Look, do we have to stay here. Can't I go and find the Doctor? 
THOMNI: The Doctor? But he's gone. 
VICTORIA: Gone? Gone where? 
THOMNI: To the mountain. I thought you knew. Did Sapan not tell you? 
VICTORIA: I knew he was keeping something from me. I've a good mind to go after them. 
THOMNI: That would be foolish. 
VICTORIA: Don't worry, I'm not really serious. 
THOMNI: Oh, please, forgive me, I'm being a very bad host. Would you care for some food? 
VICTORIA: No, thank you. Er, yes. Perhaps on second thoughts I will. 
(Thomni smiles and leaves. Once he is out of sight, Victoria leaves.)

[Mountainside]

(The Doctor and Jamie find the three Yeti.) 
DOCTOR: They're not moving. 
JAMIE: They can't have seen us, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Perhaps they're switched off? I wonder. 
JAMIE: Don't be a fool, Doctor. No point in taking chances. Let's get to the Tardis while we can. 
DOCTOR: Yes, perhaps you're right. Come on. 
(They skirt around the Yeti. A few moment later, Songsten appears carrying the pyramid. It starts to hum and the Yeti come to life, surrounding him. The Yeti escort Songsten to the cave.)

[Cell]

(Thomni returns with food.) 
THOMNI: Oh, no! Miss Victoria!

[Courtyard]

THOMNI: Ralpachan. The girl, did she go out? 
KHRISONG: What did you want, Thomni? 
THOMNI: I went for food, now she has disappeared. 
KHRISONG: Fool. 
THOMNI: I think she went after the Doctor. 
KHRISONG: No one has passed Ralpachan. 
THOMNI: Then she must still be in the monastery. 
KHRISONG: Find her! 
THOMNI: Where? Where could she?

[Sanctum]

THOMNI [OC]: Miss Victoria! 
(Victoria sneaks in.) 
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: It were better that you were not found in here, my child. 
VICTORIA: Who's that? 
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: The monks will look upon your presence here as sacrilege. 
VOICE [OC]: Go, quickly!

[Meeting room]

(The sphere rolls in. The flap in the Yeti's front opens to receive it.) 
THOMNI [OC]: Miss Victoria! Miss Victoria, where are you? 
(Victoria enters, but doesn't notice what is going on with the Yeti behind her.)

[Corridor]

THOMNI: Miss Victoria! 
SAPAN: My son, what is the matter? 
THOMNI: Oh, Sapan. The girl, I can't find her. I think she may have 
(Victoria screams.) 
THOMNI: Miss Victoria!

[Meeting room]

(Victoria is cowering in the corner as the Yeti comes to life, snapping its chains and rising from the table.)

Episode Four

[Meeting room]

VICTORIA: Oh, no. Thomni! Help, Thomni! 
THOMNI: Run, Miss Victoria! Run! Fetch Khrisong. 
(Thomni swings an incense burner at the Yeti, making it pause for a moment.)

[Corridor]

VICTORIA: The Yeti! The Yeti! Fetch help. Where's Khrisong? 
SAPAN: But where is Thomni? What has happened? 
VICTORIA: He's in there. He's coming. Now hurry! 
(The Yeti stands in the meeting room doorway, then moves away. Bleeding, Thomni follows.)

[Courtyard]

SAPAN: Khrisong! The Yeti, it is alive. 
KHRISONG: What? 
VICTORIA: It's true, Khrisong. Quick, it's coming. Do something. 
(Thomni enters with the Yeti moments behind him.) 
KHRISONG: Get back! Get back! Ralpachan, help him. Get him. Get up. 
(The monks' swords and arrows have no effect. Thomni and Victoria get the main gates open just in time for the Yeti to walk out of the monastery.)

[Mountainside]

JAMIE: What's the matter, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Oh? Oh, I'm just taking a breather, that's all. 
JAMIE: You've heard something? 
DOCTOR: No, no, nothing. 
JAMIE: Well, come on then. 
DOCTOR: Listen. 
JAMIE: Nothing. 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what's worrying me. It's too quiet. We've not seen a sign of the Yeti since we left those three back there. 
JAMIE: Well, let's just be grateful and get to the Tardis. 
DOCTOR: I don't like it. There's something happening on this mountain. I can feel it. 
JAMIE: Here, you're giving me the willies. Come on. 
(Meanwhile, two Yeti are approaching the cave. The one carrying the control sphere stands outside while the other goes back down the mountain. Travers is still watching, and sees Songsten and his escort approach the cave. Songsten takes the sphere from the Yeti, which leaves. Then he goes into the cave alone, leaving three Yeti standing guard.) 
JAMIE: Look, Doctor. 
(The Tardis is guarded by a Yeti. The Doctor and Jamie take cover behind a rock.) 
DOCTOR: I thought we'd been too lucky. 
JAMIE: What now? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. We've got to get to the Tardis somehow. 
JAMIE: Aye, well you can't frighten one of those things away. 
DOCTOR: No. 
JAMIE: I wonder what he's waiting for? 
DOCTOR: Hmm? 
JAMIE: Well, he couldn't have known we were coming. 
DOCTOR: It's a robot, Jamie. It merely follows instructions. 
JAMIE: Who's giving them? 
DOCTOR: That we shall have to find out, won't we? 
JAMIE: Get down, Doctor!

[Inner Sanctum]

PADMASAMBHAVA: Oh, Great Intelligence, have I served you well? After so many years, can I feel the grip of your power loosen? How long before your great experiment begins and I can rest? So soon? I am not sorry. What of the others? It will be done. Songsten is making final preparations.

[Cave]

(The rockfall has been cleared, and the spheres are now arranged in a circle. Songsten places the transparent pyramid in the middle and leaves. The pyramid pulsates with light. Outside, Travers watches Songsten and his escort leave. When they are out of sight, Travers goes to the cave.)

[Outside the Tardis]

DOCTOR: Yes. 
JAMIE: Have you thought up some clever plan, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, I believe I have. 
JAMIE: What are you going to do? 
DOCTOR: Bung a rock at it. 
JAMIE: Oh, be serious, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, I am. 
(The Doctor throws a rock at the Tardis.) 
JAMIE: Hey, no, Doctor. 
(The Yeti does not move.) 
DOCTOR: There you are, you see? Just as I thought. It can't see and it can't feel. Come on. 
JAMIE: Don't be daft, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Well. it's quite all right, Jamie. It's like those three back there. It's either switched off or not receiving. Come along. 
JAMIE: Are you sure it's quite safe? 
DOCTOR: Well, quite frankly, no, Jamie. But there's only one way of finding out. 
(The Doctor goes up to the Yeti and touches it, then listens to its chest.) 
JAMIE: Don't, Doctor. You might switch it on. 
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so, Jamie. Yes, just as I thought. Now then. 
(The Doctor uses a screwdriver on the Yeti.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, will you hold this flap open for me, please? Thank you. 
JAMIE: Hey you're taking an awful risk, Doctor. 
(The Doctor removes the control sphere.) 
DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad that's over. Catch. 
JAMIE: Hey, I just thought of something, Doctor. The man that made these robots is very clever, right? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
JAMIE: And yet we were able to walk right up to it and put it out of action just like that. 
DOCTOR: You mean, why didn't they build in some sort of protective device? 
JAMIE: Aye. 
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps they didn't think it was necessary. I mean, look at him. Would you walk up to a creature like that with just a screwdriver in your hand? 
JAMIE: No, I would not. 
DOCTOR: No, there you are. I'm really rather pleased with myself. 
(The Doctor goes into the Tardis.)

[Cave]

(As Travers enters, the light from the pyramid grows brighter and it hums loudly. Travers falls, covering his ears, as the pyramid opens and lets a thick liquid ooze out onto the floor of the cave. Travers crawls out towards the mountainside.)

[Outside the Tardis]

JAMIE: Have you not found it yet? 
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes, Jamie. Sorry, I'm just coming. 
(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis with a small device. The control sphere Jamie is holding starts to beep.) 
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Jamie? 
JAMIE: Look! 
DOCTOR: Ah, splendid, splendid. It's sending out a signal. That's just what we wanted. 
(The sphere pulls Jamie towards the Yeti.) 
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, you'll have to help me or I'll let go. 
DOCTOR: Oh, no, you mustn't do that. Jamie, no! 
JAMIE: It's no use, I'll have to let go. 
DOCTOR: Whatever happens, you mustn't let go, Jamie. 
JAMIE: It's no use, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: No. 
(The Doctor stands between the sphere and the Yeti, getting crushed.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, get a rock. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: A rock! Put it in the hole in its chest. 
(Jamie manages to do so and the sphere falls to the ground.) 
JAMIE: Are you all right, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm all right. Just a bit puffed, that's all. Jamie, these things are programmed to return to their Yetis. That one that disappeared in the monastery. That wasn't taken. 
JAMIE: It moved itself. It could have got to the Yeti, the one we captured. Come on. 
(Jamie picks up the sphere and they run down the mountainside.)

[Meeting room]

KHRISONG: You deliberately disobeyed my orders. 
THOMNI: It was the only sensible thing to do. 
KHRISONG: Be silent. If you had not opened the gate the creature would not have escaped. 
VICTORIA: Khrisong, you know we couldn't stop it. You'd have been killed. Anyway, it was my idea to open the gates. 
RINCHEN: Was it? Was it also your idea to breath life into the Yeti? 
VICTORIA: What do you mean? 
RINCHEN: Were you not with the creature when it came to life? 
VICTORIA: Yes, but 
SAPAN: You think that she was 
RINCHEN: Who else could have done this? 
THOMNI: Oh, this is foolishness. 
KHRISONG: Continue, Rinchen. 
RINCHEN: The creature was here, dead. What reason had you to enter this room? 
VICTORIA: I was hiding. 
RINCHEN: Hiding? Why? For what purpose? 
KHRISONG: Speak! 
THOMNI: She means no harm. 
KHRISONG: Be silent. 
RINCHEN: Your young warrior seems to anxious to protect this stranger. What are they plotting, these two? 
THOMNI: No! You do not understand. 
RINCHEN: Where is your authority, Khrisong, that your warriors forget their allegiance. 
KHRISONG: Lock them up.

[Mountainside]

JAMIE: Hey, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: What is it? 
JAMIE: It's started again. The signal's started. 
DOCTOR: Oh no. No, that's another sort of signal. 
(Further down, Songsten's Yeti turn and start back up.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, I've just picked up another signal. 
JAMIE: Oh, Doctor, let's get to the monastery. You said you'd do all your tracking from there. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, you don't seem to understand. 
JAMIE: Oh, don't I though? While you're fiddling with that thing, this sphere is calling up all the Yeti in creation. 
DOCTOR: What a perfect opportunity to trace the main transmitter. 
JAMIE: Aye, and a perfect opportunity to get ourselves killed.

[Cell]

VICTORIA: I wish the Doctor would come back. 
THOMNI: This Doctor, is he your guardian? 
VICTORIA: I suppose he is in a way. 
THOMNI: He is a good man. 
VICTORIA: I think so. 
THOMNI: Tell me, Miss Victoria, how did he come by our holy bell? 
VICTORIA: I don't really know. Why? 
THOMNI: It disappeared three hundred years ago. 
VICTORIA: Oh, stolen, you mean? 
THOMNI: No, it was given to a stranger, for safe keeping during a time of trouble. It was never returned. 
VICTORIA: A stranger? Of course, the Doctor. They're one and the same man. 
THOMNI: But three hundred years? 
VICTORIA: Oh, dear. Well, I know this sounds silly, but the Doctor can travel through time and space. He has a machine, you see, and, well, I don't really understand it myself. It's rather difficult to explain. 
THOMNI: There is no need. I understand perfectly. 
VICTORIA: You do? 
THOMNI: Yes. You see, it is said that our Master, Padmasambhava, can free himself from his earthly body and travel great distances. 
VICTORIA: Oh. 
THOMNI: But this can only be obtained after many years of strict discipline and self training. 
VICTORIA: You mean, you mean that you might be able to do that sort of thing? 
THOMNI: Perhaps, one day.

[Courtyard]

KHRISONG: Rinchen, where is Songsten? 
RINCHEN: No one has seen him for many hours. He will be with Padmasambhava. 
KHRISONG: Padmasambhava. 
SAPAN: To seek guidance. 
KHRISONG: Or is it to escape his responsibilities? 
SAPAN: Khrisong, you should not say such things. 
KHRISONG: Why not? Has anyone seen Padmasambhava? Ralpachan. Inform me when the Doctor returns. 
SAPAN: Khrisong would be wise not to voice such thoughts. 
RINCHEN: Perhaps, but brave men are impatient. And he is no fool. 
(The lamas go into the buildings. There is a knock at the wicket gate. Ralpachan opens it and Songsten enters, and hypnotises the guard.) 
SONGSTEN: Sleep, Ralpachan. You have not seen me. You have not opened the gate. No one has entered. When I leave the courtyard, you will not know that you have slept.

[Inner Sanctum]

PADMASAMBHAVA: You have done well, Songsten. Already the Great Intelligence begins to take on material form. But it demands more. It must expand. That is why you and our brothers must depart from this place. 
SONGSTEN: Leave the monastery, Master? I understand. And the strangers? 
PADMASAMBHAVA: The strangers? Oh, yes. I will tell you how to deal with them, if they return.

[Mountainside]

JAMIE: I wish this thing would keep quiet. 
DOCTOR: Not much further. 
(A Yeti blocks their path.) 
DOCTOR: Well, we were expecting it. 
JAMIE: Now what do we do? 
(There are others behind and around them.) 
JAMIE: Trapped! 
DOCTOR: Jamie, give me the sphere. Give me the box. 
JAMIE: What now? 
DOCTOR: Move forward very slowly. Jamie, when I say run, run. Run like the wind. Don't worry about me. 
JAMIE: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Now, Jamie, please. No heroics, Jamie. 
JAMIE: But surely, Doctor 
DOCTOR: Now Jamie. Run. Run! I know what I'm doing. I hope. 
(Leaving the sphere, Jamie runs past the Yeti. The Doctor rolls the sphere away from him and the Yeti all follow it.) 
DOCTOR: It worked.

[Cell]

(Victoria is pacing.) 
THOMNI: It's no use, Miss Victoria. Even if Padmasambhava would consent to see us, we can't get out. 
VICTORIA: Can't? We haven't even tried. 
(Ralpachan enters with a tray of food and drink.) 
THOMNI: Thank you, Ralpachan. 
RALPACHAN: I am sorry about this, Thomni. 
VICTORIA: Oh, good. I am thirsty. 
(Victoria takes a long drink.) 
VICTORIA: Ugh. A funny taste. Oh, Ralpachan, has the Doctor? Oh! 
THOMNI: Miss Victoria, what is it? 
VICTORIA: No, no, no, don't touch it. The drink. 
THOMNI: Miss Victoria! 
(Victoria collapses and the men place her on the bed.) 
RALPACHAN: I will fetch some water. Stay close to her, Thomni. 
(Ralpachan leaves.) 
THOMNI: Miss Victoria? 
(Thomni turns to the window. Victoria stands up.) 
THOMNI: Miss Victoria. 
VICTORIA: I'm sorry, Thomni. 
(Victoria runs out of the cell, shutting the door behind her.) 
THOMNI: Miss Victoria!

[Meeting room]

(A full chapter meeting is taking place.) 
SONGSTEN: And in his wisdom our Master, Padmasambhava, has given me his guidance. We must all leave the monastery. It is impossible for us to defeat the Yeti. 
KHRISONG: But there may be a way. The Doctor 
SONGSTEN: No, my son, they are invincible. They will destroy us all. Therefore, in order to avoid further bloodshed, it has been decided 
(A guard whispers to Khrisong.) 
KHRISONG: Songsten, I have just been informed that the Doctor has returned. He brings with him equipment which will help us to defeat these monsters. 
SONGSTEN: Khrisong, the Master has 
KHRISONG: The Master? My apologies, Abbot. I have felt the strength of these Yeti, but still I will not meekly turn away. I mean to fight. 
(Khrisong leaves.) 
SONGSTEN: Brothers, Khrisong thinks only of our safety, we know, but in this matter he has been led astray. He has forgotten his vow of obedience. 
(Ralpachan enters.) 
SONGSTEN: In due time he will realise his 
RAPALCHAN: Master Abbot, the girl has escaped. She tricked us by feigning sickness. 
RINCHEN: She is a devil women. 
SAPAN: She must be found. 
SONGSTEN: Find her, my brothers.

[Courtyard]

KHRISONG: We had no defence against it, yet it just walked through the gates. Doctor, we must act quickly or the Abbot will prevent us. 
JAMIE: Yes, but is Victoria all right? 
KHRISONG: I did as you asked. She is locked up. Is this your equipment? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
(There is a knocking at the gate.) 
KHRISONG: Stand aside. 
(Khrisong opens the wicket gate.) 
DOCTOR: Travers! 
TRAVERS: Thank heavens. Doctor. Up there. A pyramid. 
JAMIE: What's he saying? 
DOCTOR: Shh. Go on. 
TRAVERS: A pyramid. It's a 
(Travers faints. Rinchen enters.) 
RINCHEN: Seize them. Seize the strangers. Khrisong, the girl has escaped. She is a devil woman. 
JAMIE: Victoria? Hey, what's happened? 
RINCHEN: Take these people to the cells. 
KHRISONG: No! These people can help us. Besides, this man is ill. I cannot allow it. 
(Songsten stands by the Buddha.) 
SONGSTEN: Khrisong, you will obey. Take them. 
JAMIE: No, but 
DOCTOR: Where is Victoria? 
JAMIE: Doctor, what did he mean 'a devil woman'? 
DOCTOR: What is this about Victoria? Where is she? Where are you taking us? 
(The Doctor, Jamie and Travers are taken away.) 
KHRISONG: I cannot allow this. 
SONGSTEN: You cannot allow? These are the orders of our Master. You must obey. 
KHRISONG: But these people can help us. 
SONGSTEN: The Master tells us there is no help against the Yeti. He tells us to leave. 
KHRISONG: We will not leave. 
SONGSTEN: Khrisong, do not defy me. Find the girl. Instruct your warriors. 
(Khrisong signals his warriors and they begin the search.) 
SONGSTEN: Go after them, Sapan. 
(When Songsten is alone.) 
SONGSTEN: Advise me Padmasambhava. Khrisong turns his warriors away from the path of obedience. 
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: I hear, Songsten, and I understand. Well, if they will not be lead then they must be driven from the monastery. This is what you must do. 
SONGSTEN: I understand, Master. 
(Songsten goes to the gate sentry, Khedru.) 
SONGSTEN: Help them search for the girl. Go quickly. 
(Khedru leaves, and Songsten opens the main gates.)

[Sanctum]

(In the inner sanctum, four Yeti models are placed immediately outside the model monastery gates. Meanwhile, Victoria is in the outer room.) 
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: Come in, my child. 
(The doors to the inner sanctum open. Victoria sees the ancient Master.) 
PADMASAMBHAVA: Come in. You have no alternative.

Episode Five

[Inner sanctum]

(Victoria enters.) 
PADMASAMBHAVA: Do not be afraid. 
VICTORIA: Are, are you? 
PADMASAMBHAVA: I am Padmasambhava. 
VICTORIA: I'm sorry to intrude. I know this room's meant to be private, but 
PADMASAMBHAVA: You need my help. Is that not so? 
VICTORIA: Oh yes. Please, the Doctor. 
PADMASAMBHAVA: One moment, child. 
VICTORIA: But. 
PADMASAMBHAVA: Shh. 
VICTORIA: What is it? 
PADMASAMBHAVA: The courtyard is empty. 
VICTORIA: Courtyard? 
PADMASAMBHAVA: I must do what I am compelled to do. 
VICTORIA: What's that? 
PADMASAMBHAVA: Come closer. 
(Padmasambhava picks up a model Yeti and shows it to Victoria.) 
PADMASAMBHAVA: Look. See? 
VICTORIA: It's one of those horrible creatures. A Yeti. 
PADMASAMBHAVA: Indeed. 
VICTORIA: But how 
PADMASAMBHAVA: You have not seen it. 
(He passes his hand in front of Victoria's eyes and puts her into a trance. Padmasambhava puts four model Yeti inside the monastery courtyard. Four life-size ones walk into the courtyard and split up.)

[Cell]

(The Doctor is tending to Travers.) 
JAMIE: She must have had some reason. I mean, why would she run off like that? 
THOMNI: Her motives were not clear to me, Mister Jamie. 
JAMIE: Oh headstrong, that's what she is. 
TRAVERS: No! No! No! 
DOCTOR: All right, Travers. You're quite safe. 
TRAVERS: Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
TRAVERS: What happened? Oh, my head. 
DOCTOR: Just relax. You're safe, in the monastery. 
TRAVERS: The monastery? 
DOCTOR: What happened? Where did you go to? 
JAMIE: Was it the Yeti? 
TRAVERS: No, no, not the Yeti. It was something else. It was a light, a blinding white light and a noise. A piercing noise that went right through my head. I couldn't stand it. Then I can't remember anymore. 
THOMNI: You spoke of a pyramid. 
TRAVERS: Pyramid? 
THOMNI: Yes, at the gates when you returned. 
TRAVERS: Pyramid? No, no. I left the monastery, then er, then. It's no use, my mind's a complete blank. 
DOCTOR: You just rest. 
(Travers gasps.) 
DOCTOR: What is it? 
TRAVERS: No! 
THOMNI: We are taught that it is better to share a memory of fear. 
TRAVERS: Evil. A feeling of evil. Like a shadow on my mind. 
DOCTOR: Yes? 
TRAVERS: I felt as though I was going to drown. 
JAMIE: But where did this happen? 
TRAVERS: I, I don't know, I can't remember. Oh, I'm tired, so tired. 
DOCTOR: You just rest. You'll feel better. Poor fellow, he's completely exhausted. 
JAMIE: What does he mean, a shadow? 
DOCTOR: We'll just let him sleep. 
THOMNI: What could it be, this evil of which he speaks? 
(There is the sound of falling masonry.) 
JAMIE: What was that? 
MONKS [OC]: The Yeti! The Yeti! 
JAMIE: Khrisong, what's happening? 
KHRISONG: The Yeti have broken in. You are safe here. 
JAMIE: But Victoria, where is she? 
RINCHEN: Who can tell? But she will be found. She must be stopped. 
(The Doctor checks his tracking device.) 
JAMIE: Doctor, is there nothing we can do? 
DOCTOR: Shush.

[Meeting room]

(The monks and lamas barricade themselves in.) 
SONGSTEN: Calm. 
KHRISONG: Forgive me, Songsten. I have failed to defend the monastery. 
SONGSTEN: Failed? No. This disaster was written. Man cannot alter his destiny. 
KHRISONG: I should have obeyed you, my Abbot. My desire to fight these creatures was foolish, but I will defend you with my life. 
SAPAN: Abbot, I fear for Rinchen's safety. 
SONGSTEN: Is he not here? 
SAPAN: No. He would not seek safety. He is so sure that the girl is responsible. 
KHRISONG: He is still searching for her? 
SAPAN: Yes. 
SONGSTEN: Find her. 
KHRISONG: If it is not too late. 
RALPACHAN: The Yeti. They are turning back. 
KHRISONG: Then you are safe for the moment. Ralpachan, come with me.

[Courtyard]

(Rinchen watches as two Yeti wreck the cloisters.) 
RINCHEN: Stop! Stop! She-devil, wherever you are, call off these monsters. Spare us. 
(The other two Yeti rock the Buddha statue.) 
RINCHEN: Oh, no! Oh, no! 
(The statue falls on Rinchen, killing him. The four Yeti leave through the main gates and go back up the mountain.) 
KHRISONG: He's dead. 
RALPACHAN: The monastery of Detsen is accursed.

[Inner sanctum]

(Padmasambhava removes the models from the monastery. Victoria is still in a trance.) 
PADMASAMBHAVA: Now it is complete. Now the monks will leave. By nightfall the monastery will be emptied. The mountain yours. Will this then be your final command? Will you then be content? I do not understand, but I will continue to serve. 
(He turns to Victoria.) 
PADMASAMBHAVA: And now we must consider the problem of you and your friends. The Doctor is not easily frightened like my poor monks. Therefore, my child, you will assist me. Together we will make sure that he leaves. Come closer. This is what you will do.

[Cell]

(Thomni has chalked a plan of the monastery on a wall.) 
THOMNI: This is the courtyard and we are here, to the south. 
DOCTOR: I see, Thomni. So here lies north. 
THOMNI: That is so. 
DOCTOR: What are those readings again, Jamie? Jamie, the readings? 
JAMIE: What? What? 
DOCTOR: The readings? 
JAMIE: I'm sorry, I was thinking of Victoria. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I know, but there's nothing we can do about her. 
JAMIE: Two ninety seven, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Two ninety seven. Now that will give us a bearing roughly there. 
THOMNI: Does your science help us, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: No. We want another bearing, say, from there. And where those two cross, that will be where the transmissions are coming from. But that won't tell us why. 
THOMNI: Why? 
DOCTOR: Yes, what is the purpose behind all this. That's what we have to find out, ay Jamie? 
TRAVERS: Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Are you feeling better? 
TRAVERS: Better? What are we doing in here? What's happened? 
DOCTOR: You had a spot of trouble on the mountain. 
TRAVERS: Trouble? 
JAMIE: Aye, with the Yeti no doubt. 
TRAVERS: Funny, I don't remember. Sorry, I'm a bit confused. 
JAMIE: Well you sounded it, with all that talk about. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure it'll all come back to you in time. 
TRAVERS: Yes, with the headache I've got, no wonder I can't remember anything. I think I'll get a bit of fresh air. Why is this door locked?

[Courtyard]

SONGSTEN: Do not blame yourself, Khrisong. Death is inevitable. Sambhutar, Ghentan, take up our brother. We will take him with us on our journey. There will be a time to mourn our brother. 
KHRISONG: Put to the test I ran and hid like a mountain rabbit. I'm not fit to be called a warrior. We must lead out our brothers before more of them are destroyed. 
SONGSTEN: Gather what is needed, my brothers. Soon it will be the hour for meditation, then we must depart. 
KHRISONG: What of the strangers, master Abbott? 
SONGSTEN: They will be taken with us to a place of safety. 
SAPAN: But the girl is lost. 
SONGSTEN: Khrisong and his warriors will find her. 
KHRISONG: And the Master? What of Padmasambhava? 
SONGSTEN: His powers are great. He will remain. 
(Some of the monks are on their knees. Victoria enters in a trance, carrying the holy ghanta.) 
SONGSTEN: The holy Ghanta. 
KHRISONG: Child, how came you 
SAPAN: Shh. She has entered the Sanctum. 
KHRISONG: Then let me. 
SONGSTEN: Silence. See, she is about to speak. 
(Victoria's mouth opens, but another voice comes out.) 
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: This is a time of much danger. 
SONGSTEN: Padmasambhava. 
(All the monks kneel.) 
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: I have chosen to speak to you myself through the lips of this maiden. She bears the holy Ghanta. Bear it away to safe keeping. Treat this child with kindness. She and the strangers are innocent of any malice towards you. Their wish is but to help you against the Yeti. But in my wisdom I tell you, there is no help. Detsen must be abandoned. When the wind destroys the nest, so the bird will build another. 
SONGSTEN: But what of you, Master. 
PADMASAMBHAVA: Go, with my blessing. 
SONGSTEN: But, Master. 
PADMASAMBHAVA: Do not question. I will remain here to the end. 
SAPAN: Will a day come for our return to Detsen? 
(Victoria sways, and Khrisong catches her. Songsten takes the Ghanta.) 
SONGSTEN: Take her to rest. Ralpachan, release the strangers. Bid them make ready. It is time for prayer. The last time at Detsen. Come, my brothers.

[Cell]

RALPACHAN: You are released. 
TRAVERS: I should jolly well think so. What the devil do you think you're up to. 
RALPACHAN: You must prepare to leave with us. 
TRAVERS: I shall have a few words to say to the Abbot before I go anywhere. 
JAMIE: Never mind about that. Have you found Victoria yet? 
RALPACHAN: She is safe. Khrisong is with her. 
JAMIE: Ah, good.

[Meeting room]

(Khrisong brings in Victoria.) 
KHRISONG: Are you recovered? Child? 
JAMIE: There you are, I've been worried sick. Where have you been? Victoria? What have you done to her? Doctor? Doctor, I think she's ill. 
DOCTOR: Let me see. 
VICTORIA: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes, Victoria. 
VICTORIA: There is great danger. You must take me away. Take me away. Take me away! 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes of course. 
JAMIE: Victoria, what's happened? Tell us? What's the matter with her? Victoria, it's me, Jamie. 
DOCTOR: How long has she been like this? 
VICTORIA: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes, Victoria. 
VICTORIA: There is great danger. You must take me away. Take me away. Take me away! 
KHRISONG: The child is still in a state of trance. 
DOCTOR: Still? What do you mean? 
KHRISONG: She spoke to us with the voice of the Master. 
THOMNI: Ah. Then she did reach the holy sanctum. 
JAMIE: What are you talking about? 
THOMNI: She was certain that Padmasambhava would recognise the Doctor. 
JAMIE: Recognise the Doctor? 
THOMNI: Yes, he has been here before. 
DOCTOR: But that was three hundred years ago. It's the same man. 
RALPACHAN: Khrisong, the Abbot Songsten wishes us to join our brothers in prayer. 
KHRISONG: Very well. You will prepare to leave. Is Mister Travers ready? 
RALPACHAN: He is in the courtyard. 
KHRISONG: Come, Thomni, to prayer. 
THOMNI: Khrisong, will you forgive me? 
KHRISONG: We have both of us strayed from the path of obedience. 
(The monks leave.) 
DOCTOR: (sotto) Jamie, there is something I have to do. 
JAMIE: Right. Hey, why are we whispering? 
DOCTOR: It's my voice. She reacts to my voice. 
JAMIE: Oh, it's that hypnotism thing. Can you not do anything about it? 
DOCTOR: Yes I can, but I need more information. Now, you wait here. 
JAMIE: Where are you going? 
DOCTOR: I'm going to see a very old friend.

[Inner sanctum]

(There is a cloth over the model on the table.) 
PADMASAMBHAVA: Oh, Intelligence. You promised to release me, yet still I feel your grasp upon this frail body. Why? What is happening? This was not your plan. But if you continue to expand? I have brought the world to its end. 
(In the cave the gunk is still coming from the pyramid, filling the chamber and the tunnel, and approaching the cave mouth.)
PADMASAMBHAVA: Come in, Doctor. Good to look upon your face again. So many years. 
DOCTOR: Padmasambhava. So it's true. 
PADMASAMBHAVA: I have been kept alive so many years, but now our time left is very, very short. Listen carefully. Perhaps you can 
DOCTOR: Kept alive? I don't understand. 
PADMASAMBHAVA: I didn't know. I didn't realise. 
DOCTOR: What? Try to tell me. 
PADMASAMBHAVA: Intelligence. Formless in space. I astral travelled. 
DOCTOR: I see. You made mental contact with this intelligence? 
PADMASAMBHAVA: It used my mind. It controls my body. 
DOCTOR: But why? 
PADMASAMBHAVA: Experiment. Wished material form. A voice, it said. I believed. Experiment. But now. Help. You must help me. 
DOCTOR: Yes, of course I will help you. But first you must tell me things. Why are the monks being driven away? What is the purpose of these robots, the Yeti? Where is their control? Padmasambhava? Padmasambhava? 
(The old man's head has slumped forward. The Doctor listens for a heartbeat, then leaves the room. Then the eyes open and glare after him.)

[Meeting room]

JAMIE: I wish there was something I could do. 
(Jamie goes behind Victoria, picks up a broken stool and throws it to the floor. She doesn't even twitch.) 
DOCTOR: What on earth was that? 
JAMIE: Oh, it was just an idea. 
VICTORIA: Doctor. There is great danger. You must take me away. Take me away. Take me away! 
JAMIE: Doctor, you've got to do something. Did you find out what you wanted to know? 
DOCTOR: Not about Victoria, no. But I found some very interesting clues as to what's been happening. 
JAMIE: Oh, never mind about that. It's Victoria you ought to be worrying about. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, you're quite right. Victoria must come first. Trouble is I really need more information. However, I'll just have to take a chance. It may just be simple post-hypnotic suggestion. On the other hand. 
JAMIE: Yes. 
DOCTOR: It may be something worse. 
JAMIE: What if it is? 
DOCTOR: Well, let's just hope it isn't. 
(The Doctor takes Victoria's face in his hands.) 
DOCTOR: Victoria. 
VICTORIA: Doctor. There is great danger. You must take me away. 
DOCTOR: Yes, Victoria. 
VICTORIA: Take me away. 
DOCTOR: Listen to me. You've been taken away. You're no longer in the monastery. You're safe in the Tardis. Now do you understand? You're safe. In the Tardis. Yes. Well, look at me. Look at my eyes. You're feeling tired, very sleepy. Drift away. Let yourself drift away into sleep. Deeper. Deeper. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Oh, not you Jamie. 
JAMIE: Hey, what? 
DOCTOR: So far, so good. 
JAMIE: Hey, I never knew you could do that sort of thing. 
DOCTOR: No. Neither did the person who hypnotised Victoria. 
JAMIE: What now? 
DOCTOR: Well, I'm tempted to ask her what happened, but I don't think I dare probe too deeply. The important thing is to get rid of this implanted fear. It's growing every minute. 
JAMIE: What if you can't? 
DOCTOR: Well, we shall just have to do as she asks and take her away. If we don't. 
JAMIE: Yes. 
DOCTOR: She'll go out of her mind. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: Well, that's the object of the exercise. To get us away from the monastery. But I'm not beaten that easily. 
JAMIE: Hey, you're taking an awful risk. 
DOCTOR: I know what I'm doing, Jamie. Victoria? Now, Victoria, you can hear my voice, can't you? 
VICTORIA: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Oh, good. Now I'm going to take you a little way back in the past, Victoria. You're in the cell with Thomni. Do you understand? 
VICTORIA: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Good. Now you're going to forget everything after that. You went to sleep. Is that clear? Good. Jamie and I have come back to the monastery and you are in the meeting room with us. You're feeling happy, but a little tired. Do you understand? 
VICTORIA: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Good. Now, when I count three, you're going to wake up. One, two, three. 
VICTORIA: (yawning) Oh, oh dear. Oh, I must have dropped off. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe you did. I've got work to do. 
VICTORIA: What are you grinning at?

[Courtyard]

(Travers is by the gates.) 
DOCTOR: Travers? Travers. 
TRAVERS: Yes, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: How are you feeling? 
TRAVERS: Oh, much better thanks. Look, I've been taking a look up the mountain. Those robots are still there. They're just standing, not moving. I don't like it. 
DOCTOR: Yes. I think things are coming to a head. 
TRAVERS: What are they up to? What are they waiting for? 
DOCTOR: Instructions. Travers, can you remember any more of what happened to you on the mountain? 
TRAVERS: I'm afraid not. My mind's a complete blank. 
DOCTOR: Are you prepared to risk it again? 
TRAVERS: I thought we're supposed to clear out. 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, the monks are, but I want to get back up the mountain. One more bearing and I shall know where the control centre is. 
TRAVERS: I see. You want me to help you. 
DOCTOR: Yes, if you will. 
TRAVERS: What about your young friends? 
DOCTOR: Oh, they're leaving with the monks, but I want to get out of here before anyone sees us. Will you help? 
TRAVERS: All right, I'm on. 
DOCTOR: Oh, good.

[Mountainside]

(The Doctor and Travers find two motionless Yeti. They hide behind a rock and the Doctor checks his tracking device.) 
DOCTOR: What's the matter? 
TRAVERS: I don't know. I've got a feeling I've done this before. Now, what do you want me to do? 
DOCTOR: I want you to stay here and take some readings. Those Yeti are not transmitting. I'm going over there to stir things up a bit. 
TRAVERS: I don't understand that thing. You'd better let me go. 
DOCTOR: Oh no, it's far too dangerous. I can't ask you to take that sort of risk. 
TRAVERS: Rot. I can take care of myself. Right. Now, wish me luck. 
DOCTOR: No, wait! 
(The Yeti move away.) 
DOCTOR: That's odd. 
TRAVERS: You got your readings Because if you've got the reading. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
TRAVERS: What's up?

[Courtyard]

KHRISONG: Is there any sign? 
RALPACHAN: No. Every room is empty. 
THOMNI: Mister Travers and the Doctor are nowhere to be found. 
KHRISONG: It as you wished. The monastery is deserted. 
SONGSTEN: This is well. I will ask a final blessing of our Master, Padmasambhava, then we will depart. 
VICTORIA: Padmasambhava! 
JAMIE: Try not to think about it. 
VICTORIA: But I think 
JAMIE: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Khrisong, I have found the control. 
KHRISONG: It is too late, Doctor, I can no longer help you. 
DOCTOR: But you don't understand. It's here, in the monastery. 
TRAVERS: What? That's impossible. 
THOMNI: But the monastery is empty. We are all here. 
DOCTOR: Are we? Are we all here? 
THOMNI: The Master! 
SAPAN: Songsten is with him. 
KHRISONG: Then he is in great danger. Stay where you are, all of you. 
TRAVERS: Songsten. I remember. Songsten, the Yeti, on the mountain. Yes, yes, it's all coming back to me. 
JAMIE: Well, tell us. 
TRAVERS: There was this cave.

[Cave]

(And the corporeal form of the Intelligence is spilling from the cave onto the mountainside.)

Episode Six

[Courtyard]

DOCTOR: It was Songsten who took this pyramid into the cave? 
TRAVERS: That's right. 
JAMIE: And the Yeti never harmed him? 
TRAVERS: No. 
DOCTOR: Songsten. He's the link I've been looking for. 
THOMNI: But Khrisong is with Songsten now. 
DOCTOR: Then he's in danger.

[Sanctum]

(Songsten is praying when Khrisong rushes in.) 
KHRISONG: Songsten! Danger. You are in great danger. Come away from this place. 
SONGSTEN: What madness is this? 
VOICE [OC]: Khrisong, whence came you by such foolish thoughts? 
KHRISONG: Don't try and frighten me. Who are you? I demand to know what is happening. 
SONGSTEN: Demand? You are in the presence of the Master. 
KHRISONG: Yes, a master who controls the Yeti. What is hidden in there? 
SONGSTEN: Forgive him, Master. 
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: Of course. But our brother must not be allowed to depart in the knowledge that I am other than what I am. 
VOICE [OC]: Songsten! 
KHRISONG: Why do you put him in a trance? 
VOICE [OC]: You understand, Songsten? 
SONGSTEN: I understand, Master. 
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: You may enter, Khrisong. 
SONGSTEN: One moment. You may not take weapons into the presence of the Master. 
VOICE [OC]: Are you afraid? 
(Khrisong gives his sword to Songsten and turns to the inner doors. Songsten stabs him.)

[Inner sanctum]

(Padmasambhava's face shows the battle for control of his mind.) 
VOICE: You have done well, Songsten. You will now. 
PADMASAMBHAVA: Why are you making me do this? Why? Release me, I beg of you. I am. 
VOICE: Songsten, you will now go forth with the monks. You will never return.

[Sanctum]

(During this, the door to the Inner Sanctum close again.) 
SONGSTEN: Yes, Master. 
JAMIE [OC]: Khrisong, where are you? 
THOMNI: Khrisong! What has happened? 
JAMIE: Khrisong. 
TRAVERS: We're too late. 
SONGSTEN: What have you done to Khrisong? 
TRAVERS: What have we done? Well, that's a bit cool, I must say. 
THOMNI: You have killed him. 
SONGSTEN: I? 
VOICE [OC]: Songsten, kill them! 
DOCTOR: Jamie, grab hold of him. His hands. 
(They overpower the Abbot and lead him away.) 
DOCTOR: Quick, get him out of here. 
KHRISONG: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: It's all right. Lie still. I'll get help. 
KHRISONG: Too late. My time has come. Closer. My brothers, they are not to blame Songsten. He was in a trance. 
DOCTOR: I understand. Now just try and 
KHRISONG: No. Leave. Leave me here. 
(Khrisong dies. When the room is empty, the demented laughter of the possessed Master rings out.)

[Courtyard]

THOMNI: My brothers. My brothers, Khrisong is dead. 
SAPAN: Dead? 
RALPACHAN: By whose hand? 
THOMNI: By the hand of our Abbot, Songsten. 
SAPAN: This cannot be. 
TRAVERS: Aye, it's true enough. 
SAPAN: No. What reason would he have to do such a vile thing? 
JAMIE: Obviously he thought Khrisong knew too much. 
SAPAN: Songsten, is this true? 
(Ralpachan raises his weapon with a cry.) 
JAMIE: Keep back! 
RALPACHAN: Do not interfere, stranger. 
THOMNI: No, leave him alone. There's been enough killing. 
VICTORIA: Jamie, no! 
THOMNI: Wait! Wait, my brothers. This is no time for rashness. 
DOCTOR: He is quite right. He is quite right. You listen to him. 
RALPACHAN: Well? 
SONGSTEN: Kill them. Kill them. Kill them. 
THOMNI: Look, is this our Abbot who loves peace? Surely you can see he was made to kill Khrisong. He is a helpless puppet. 
TRAVERS: But I saw him on the mountain. He was leading the Yeti. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but by command, unknowingly. Thomni is right. Songsten is merely a puppet. 
SAPAN: Who has done this to him? 
RALPACHAN: Is it you? 
THOMNI: No. I tell you I saw Songsten change. He was put in a trance by the Master. 
SAPAN: Have a care what you say. 
DOCTOR: Now listen to me, all of you. Your Abbot is not responsible. But neither is Padmasambhava. He too is controlled. Now do as you'd planned. Leave the monastery. There is great evil here. 
TRAVERS: No, Doctor, you're wrong. The evil is on the mountains. It's that hideous thing in the cave. 
SAPAN: Wherever it may be, what can we do to overcome such a force? My brothers, let us obey the Doctor. 
THOMNI: What of you, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I will stay here, Thomni. 
JAMIE: Oh, me too. 
VICTORIA: Why? 
DOCTOR: I have to. This things that's here, this evil, it will spread. It has to be stopped and I think I can do it. Thomni, will you help me? It will be dangerous. 
THOMNI: You can rid us of this evil? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I can. And if we succeed, the monks will be able to return. 
THOMNI: Then of course I will help. 
VICTORIA: Doctor, you're not going to send me away with the monks, are you? 
DOCTOR: Yes, Victoria. I think it best. 
VICTORIA: Well, I won't go. 
DOCTOR: No, I didn't think you would. 
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor. Songsten, he's unconscious. 
RALPACHAN: Sapan, tend our Abbot. 
DOCTOR: No. Wait. There are things I have to find out and only Songsten can tell me. 
JAMIE: What makes you so sure he's going to do that? 
DOCTOR: Sit him down here, Jamie. Over there. 
(Travers and Ralpachan are talking by the gate.) 
TRAVERS: The Doctor's got it wrong. I've seen that thing in the cave. That's what we've got to destroy. 
RALPACHAN: The Doctor thinks the evil is here, in 
TRAVERS: I know, I've seen it. He hasn't. He said himself that Padmasambhava was being controlled. And it's that thing that was doing it. I'm going to get at it. Are you coming with me? 
RALPACHAN: Very well. 
TRAVERS: Good man, come on. 
RALPACHAN: What do you plan to do? 
TRAVERS: I don't quite know yet. Got to get to that cave. The pyramid's the answer. I just have to take a shot at it with this. Come on. 
(Rifle in hand, Travers leads Ralpachan out to the mountainside. In the cave, the Intelligence continues to come from the pyramid. The Doctor has hypnotised Songsten.) 
DOCTOR: And the Yeti? 
SONGSTEN: They were designed to serve the Intelligence. 
DOCTOR: I see. Now, this Intelligence, it is confined to the cave? 
SONGSTEN: No. 
DOCTOR: No? 
SONGSTEN: It has broken its promise. Now it demands the whole mountain. 
DOCTOR: I see. Now, Songsten, I want you to help me. 
SONGSTEN: I want to help you. 
DOCTOR: Now these Yeti, they are controlled? 
SONGSTEN: Yes, by Padmasambhava. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but the control units, they were made somehow, somewhere? 
SONGSTEN: The Master laboured for nearly two hundred years. With the help of the Intelligence, he built the creatures and the other wonderful machines. 
DOCTOR: These small Yeti models. Their movements must be mirrored by the real robots? 
SONGSTEN: True. 
DOCTOR: But there must be a control. A machine that gives out the orders. Now, where is that control? 
SONGSTEN: The sanctum. 
DOCTOR: But I have seen the sanctum. 
SONGSTEN: Throne. Behind the throne there lies a hidden room. 
DOCTOR: How do I get into it? Songsten, how do I get into it? 
(The model is uncovered and two Yeti are being sent to the monastery.)

[Mountainside]

(It is now night. The men hide from two moving Yeti.) 
TRAVERS: That was a close one. Heading towards the monastery. 
RALPACHAN: Should we not return? 
TRAVERS: No, now we've come this far. Let's push on. Come on.

[Courtyard]

DOCTOR: Take care of him, Sapan. 
SAPAN: I will. He has suffered much. 
SONGSTEN: Is it time to leave? 
(Sapan takes Songsten away.) 
DOCTOR: Now, as soon as the monks have left, we must get into that control room. 
JAMIE: How do we get past Padma-thing-me? 
DOCTOR: I'll deal with him. But remember, as soon as we're in the sanctum, whatever happens, Thomni and you must smash the controls. 
VICTORIA: What do you mean, whatever happens? 
DOCTOR: Padmasambhava will use super-normal powers if necessary. For a start, he'll try to hypnotise you again. 
VICTORIA: Well how can I stop him? 
DOCTOR: Thomni, you'd better teach her the Jewel of the Lotus prayer. It'll give her something to concentrate on. 
THOMNI: Yes, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, where is Travers? 
JAMIE: Travers? 
DOCTOR: Well, he's not here. 
JAMIE: Perhaps he's deserted us. 
DOCTOR: No, I don't somehow think he's done that, but I'd like to know what he's up to.

[Mountainside]

TRAVERS: Well, we're going the right way. There's some sort of path along here. 
RALPACHAN: Look. 
(The whole mountaintop is lit up.) 
RALPACHAN: What is it? 
TRAVERS: It's that hideous light from the cave. It's spreading all over the mountain. 
RALPACHAN: It's blinding me. How can we reach the pyramid? 
TRAVERS: We can't. It's too late for that now, I'm afraid. 
RALPACHAN: But it will engulf the monastery.

[Courtyard]

SAPAN: Doctor, why will you not accept the aid of our warrior brothers? 
DOCTOR: Because they're needed to guard you and the lamas, Sapan. 
THOMNI: Besides brave hearts will not suffice for this battle. 
SAPAN: Protect them, Thomni. We shall pray for you. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. Don't worry, everything will be all right. When it's all over you can come back. I hope. 
(The monks parade out, chanting. When they have left, four Yeti take up position outside the monastery gates.) 
DOCTOR: Now don't forget. I will go into the sanctum first and deal with Padmasambhava. And, as soon as it's safe, make for the curtain behind the throne. That's where the control room is. 
THOMNI: But when we have destroyed the machine, what'll happen? 
DOCTOR: I haven't the faintest idea. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Jamie. It's going to be all right. 
JAMIE: Hey, we might all be blown to smithereens. 
VICTORIA: What am I supposed to do? 
DOCTOR: Well nothing, I hope, but one of us just might need help. Are we ready? Come on.

[Monastery gate]

(Travers and Ralpachan return to see the Yeti blocking their way.) 
RALPACHAN: What shall we do? 
TRAVERS: Looks as though we're well and truly cooked. 
RALPACHAN: Look. There below us, torches. The monks must have left. 
TRAVERS: Yes, but has the Doctor? 
RALPACHAN: How can we tell? We are trapped. 
TRAVERS: I don't know. 
RALPACHAN: We cannot enter the monastery. 
TRAVERS: Looks as though we'll just have to sit tight. 
RALPACHAN: Can we not try and join my brothers? 
TRAVERS: No. The Doctor may still be in there. I'm sure he is.

[Sanctum]

(Jamie and Thonmi take their positions either side of the inner doors as the Doctor tries to open them.) 
VOICE [OC]: Why are you here? Why did you not heed my warning? You are stubborn, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Who are you? 
VOICE [OC]: You know well it is I, the Master, Padmasambhava, who speaks. 
DOCTOR: Oh no, it isn't. I know Padmasambhava. He's my friend. Where have you come from? Why are you using his body in this fashion? 
VOICE [OC]: Such a brain as yours is too small to grasp my purpose. 
DOCTOR: Too small? 
VOICE [OC]: I am much power. 
DOCTOR: Much power? 
(One of the incense burners rises into the air.) 
DOCTOR: Just a simple levitation. A childish trick. Now stop playing games and open these doors. Or are you afraid to meet me face to face? 
VOICE [OC]: You are rash. 
(The inner doors open.) 
DOCTOR: Now, anything can happen now. Just trust me, and above all, don't panic. 
(The Doctor enters the Inner sanctum, and cries out in pain.) 
VICTORIA: No! No! The Doctor said to wait.

[Inner Sanctum]

(The Doctor is bent over, trying to reach the throne. Padmasambhava is in pain, but the Intelligence still has control. The Doctor struggles to stand, and a wind howls through the room. The supporting frame is torn down.) 
DOCTOR: Now! 
JAMIE [OC]: Come on, Thomni. 
(Jamie and Thomni are stopped by the Intelligence. The Doctor locks minds with it, and Jamie and Thomni can move again.) 
DOCTOR: Quickly. Into the control room. Smash the controls. 
JAMIE: To work, Thomni. 
(They smash panels and rip out wiring. There is a metal pyramid on an altar, about two feet high. Opposite it is a large sphere. Padmasambhava reaches for the model.) 
VICTORIA: Doctor, he's bringing the Yeti in! 
(The hand brings the Yeti into the monastery.) 
DOCTOR: Victoria, Victoria, I can't hold him. The models. Knock over the models! No, Victoria, don't let him. Jewel of the Lotus. Om mane padme hum. Om mane padme hum. 
VICTORIA: Om mane padme hum. Om mane padme hum. 
(But she was completely unable to move.)

[Monastery gate]

(The Yeti enter the courtyard.) 
TRAVERS: At last. Come on.

[Inner sanctum]

VICTORIA: Om mane padme hum. Oh, it's no good. I can't move. 
DOCTOR: You've got to. 
VICTORIA: I can't! 
DOCTOR: Jamie! Jamie! Jamie! Yeti's coming!

[Control room]

JAMIE: Yeti? 
THOMNI: But we have destroyed the machines. 
JAMIE: Well there must something else that controls them. The control unit. Of course, the sphere.

[Inner sanctum]

(The Yeti enter. Jamie smashes the sphere. There is a flash of light. The robot's chest units explode and they collapse.) 
VOICE [OC]: One stroke of fortune will not save you. 
(Travers and Ralpachan enter. Travers shoots at the old man, who catches the bullets in his hand.) 
VOICE [OC]: Stupid man. Did you not feel enough of my power when you met me in the cave? 
TRAVERS: The cave? 
DOCTOR: The cave. Jamie! There was a pyramid in the cave!

[Control room]

JAMIE: There's one here too.

[Inner sanctum]

DOCTOR: Destroy it! 
VOICE [OC]: No! 
(Jamie uses Thomni's stave to smash the pyramid and Padmasambhava screams. He falls from the throne, knocking over the model. Everything shakes as something in the distance explodes. It is the pyramid in the cave, which takes the top of the mountain with it in the blast.) 
VICTORIA: Look at him. 
PADMASAMBHAVA: At last, peace. Thank you, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Goodbye old friend. 
JAMIE: Are you all right, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. It worked. The Intelligence is destroyed. 
TRAVERS: Yes, well, it was most decidedly tricky for a minute or two. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Thomni, you can signal the monks they can return. 
(Thonmi and Ralpachan leave.) 
TRAVERS: Doctor, are you trying to tell me that that old man was responsible for all this? The Yeti? The cave? 
DOCTOR: Oh no, no. He was just a tool in the hands of a monstrous brain. It wasn't his fault. 
VICTORIA: It's horrible. Let's get away from here. 
JAMIE: Aye, come on. 
(The monastery gong rings out.)

[Courtyard]

(Dawn. The gong is still sounding as the travellers prepare to depart.) 
THOMNI: Please, Doctor. Our Abbot will be most grieved that he did not thank you personally. Will you not wait? 
DOCTOR: Ah no, Thomni, we're anxious to get back to the Tar. 
(Jamie coughs.) 
DOCTOR: We're anxious to get back. 
THOMNI: Goodbye, Doctor. 
TRAVERS: I'll see them safely up the mountain. 
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Thomni. 
JAMIE: Goodbye. 
VICTORIA: Bye, Thomni.

[Mountainside]

(They find the remains of a Yeti.) 
JAMIE: Aye, well those things won't bother us anymore, Doctor. 
VICTORIA: Those horrible things. 
DOCTOR: Ah, they were clever machines. Almost a pity to have had them destroyed. Well, at least you'll have something to take home from your expedition, Mister Travers. 
TRAVERS: I suppose so. But nobody'll believe me. They'd think I'd had it made. No, I'm afraid the expedition's over now. 
VICTORIA: Oh Doctor, look. 
JAMIE: Oh no. 
DOCTOR: It can't be. 
(A shaggy, bear-like creature is racing towards them. Then it sees them and runs away again.) 
TRAVERS: A Yeti. A real Yeti! At last! Excuse the haste. Goodbye and all that. Mustn't lose this one. 
JAMIE: Do you think he'll ever find his abominable snowman, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well, that we shall never know, Jamie. What's the matter with you? Are you cold or something? 
JAMIE: Oh it's all right for you in your home made Yeti kit. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose there is a little bit of a nip in the air. 
JAMIE: A nip? A nip? Just look at my knees. They're bright blue. 
DOCTOR: What a horrible sight. 
JAMIE: Could you not land us somewhere warmer next time? 
DOCTOR: Jamie, you never know, do you? 
(The Doctor plays his recorder as they walk up to the Tardis.)

[Ioniser control room]

(It is a land of glaciers, crevasses and massive icicles. In the hi-tech control room, workers in plastic tunics and knee-high boots rush around turning dials on the four curved control panels surrounding a circular central computer interface.) 
ANNOUNCER [OC]: This is a preliminary warning. Preliminary warning. Prepare phase one base evacuation procedure. Phase one evacuation. 
(Clent enters, leaning on a walking stick in his right hand. Say Hi to Peter Barkworth, everyone.) 
CLENT: Why has the ioniser been allowed to deteriorate to danger level? 
GARRETT: (woman) There was a power stoppage. I've done all I can to boost it. 
CLENT: Well, it can't be allowed to fall any lower. 
GARRETT: We still have time to evacuate. 
CLENT: We will certainly not evacuate. We've beaten its tantrums before. 
GARRETT: It's falling again. 
CLENT: Well, hold it! You must hold it steady. 
GARRETT: I can't. 
CLENT: Switch the stabilising circuits through to computer control. 
GARRETT: I have. It's still not holding! 
CLENT: All circuits, woman. All circuits! 
GARRETT: We're nearly there. 
CLENT: There's not enough power. 
GARRETT: It's slowing down. 
CLENT: Maybe it'll hold there. 
GARRETT: I doubt it. 
CLENT: Well, at least it gives us time. 
GARRETT: We need Scientist Penley. 
CLENT: He is no longer a member of this post. You will make this machine work. 
GARRETT: Yes, Leader Clent. 
CLENT: That's better. 
GARRETT: Emergency evacuation phasing set. 
WOMAN: Yes. 
GARRETT: Ioniser state fault check. 
WOMAN 2: Yes. 
GARRETT: Reactor safety sequence in operation. Good. 
CLENT: You'll make an Organiser First Class yet, Miss Garrett. 
GARRETT: I only follow your example, Leader Clent. 
(Clent sits at the central unit.) 
CLENT: What is the latest report from all other ioniser bases? 
COMPUTER: All bases are in phase. America, glaciers held. Australasia, glaciers held. South Africa, glaciers held. Asia, some improvement claimed. 
CLENT: They would. 
COMPUTER: Britannicus Base Europe, slipping out of phase. Glacial advance imminent. 
GARRETT: If we fail, the whole programme for glacier containment is in danger. 
CLENT: I'm fully aware of that fact. 
GARRETT: But in two hours the ioniser will be useless. 
CLENT: And then the glaciers will move again. Five thousand years of history crushed beneath a moving mountain of ice. 
ANNOUNCER [OC]: Phase two evacuation. Emergency. Phase two evacuation. Red state emergency. Red state emergency. 
CLENT: Priority override. 
GARRETT: Yes, of course. But Penley was the expert. 
CLENT: I've had enough of experts and their crazy ideas. Where's Arden? 
GARRETT: Still at the ice face, completing the instrumentation project. 
CLENT: Well, hasn't he been warned? 
GARRETT: We couldn't get through. Surface communication's impossible when 
CLENT: Well, we have to tell him immediately. I cannot lose any more men. Leader Clent to Scientist Arden at glacier face. Come in, Arden.

[Glacier face]

(These men are also dressed in plastic suits, but with metal helmets and goggles too. Very appropriate for arctic conditions I don't think.) 
ARDEN: Walters, drill here. Now clear that trench, Walters, while I prepare the seismograph probe. 
WALTERS: Sir. Get your drill ready, Davis. Sir! 
ARDEN: Yes? 
WALTERS: Come quickly, sir! 
(Walters rubs snow off a wall of clear ice.) 
WALTERS: I could swear there's something inside. 
ARDEN: Oh, not another mastodon. 
WALTERS: Well, look for yourself, sir. 
ARDEN: Is it a man? 
WALTERS: Perhaps it's an animal. 
ARDEN: Well, we'll soon find out. Davis, the heavy drill. 
DAVIS: Yes, sir. 
(Walter's wrist-com beeps.) 
WALTERS: Base calling, Sir. 
ARDEN: What do they want? 
WALTERS: There's nothing coming through. Poor reception. I suppose they 
ARDEN: They'll have to wait. This is more important. Come on, Davis. 
WALTERS: Well, what are we going to do, sir? 
ARDEN: Do? Excavate. This could be a brilliant discovery. 
WALTERS: But, sir, the computerised schedule. We must stick to that. 
ARDEN: Oh, must we? 
WALTERS: Leader Clent will be furious, sir. 
ARDEN: Well, that's just too bad. For once we'll do something on our own account, eh? 
WALTERS: There's not much base can do about it, sir. After all, we can't even ask permission, can we? 
ARDEN: Come on, Davis. Hurry, man! 
(ARDEN wipes away more of the snow)

[Ioniser control room]

CLENT: Arden, for heavens sake man, come in! This is urgent! 
(But the screen is full of static. He gives up.) 
GARRETT: Failing again. (something) is decreasing. Not far from total disintegration.

[Outside the base]

(Snow piles up against the modular base walls, and the remains of dead trees stick out of it. The Tardis materialises on its side on a pile of snow, then slides down with the roof pointing to the ground. There are screams and squeals from inside. Someone pushes at the doors.) 
JAMIE [OC]: Up you go. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Just got to get my hand there. 
JAMIE [OC]: You can. Now the other one. 
(The Doctor emerges, wearing his fur coat.) 
JAMIE [OC]: Argh! 
DOCTOR: What's the matter? 
JAMIE [OC]: You're on my head! 
(The Doctor falls back inside. Victoria squeals. The Doctor clambers out again.) 
JAMIE [OC]: Careful. 
DOCTOR: Up you come. There we are. Come on, Victoria. Give me your hand. 
(All three are leaning on the Tardis 'doorstep'. Victoria has put a fur-trimmed velvet cape over her tweed jacket.) 
DOCTOR: It was a blind landing. 
JAMIE: Is that what you call it? 
VICTORIA: Well, no broken bones. Hey, look at the snow. 
JAMIE: Oh no, not again. Tibet was bad enough, but I think you've put us down just further up the mountain. 
DOCTOR: Well, let's see, shall we? Very careful. I'm going to get out. It's quite a long drop. 
JAMIE: Up you go. 
DOCTOR: Come on, Victoria. That's right. 
VICTORIA: Hey, it looks like a great big wall of ice. 
(The Doctor's eyes pop out of his head.) 
JAMIE: What is it? 
DOCTOR: You're on my hand! 
VICTORIA: But Doctor, look. 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's not ice, that's plastic. 
JAMIE: Yes, and see how smooth it is, and curved. 
DOCTOR: Yes. It's a dome. A protective dome. 
(Jamie shuts the Tardis doors.) 
VICTORIA: It's so big. Can't see the end of it. Wonder what's inside. 
(A door in the dome opens and a scruffy man in furs comes out. The travellers duck down behind the Tardis. A second scruff comes out carrying boxes.) 
PENLEY: Don't worry. Those alarms weren't meant for us. I wonder what's wrong, though. 
(Everyone say Hi! to Peter Sallis.) 
STORR: (Scots) Aye, that's their problem. Come on. 
(The two men leave and the travellers go to the now-shut door. A wolf howls nearby. The Doctor waves his hand in front of a panel and the door opens. On the opposite wall is a picture of a street with colonnaded shops. They go in and the door closes behind them.)

[Ioniser control room]

GARRETT: Leader Clent, the video! Arden has made contact. 
CLENT: Arden, can you hear me? 
ARDEN [on monitor]: Yes. What is it? 
CLENT: You must return to base immediately. 
ARDEN [on monitor]: Well, don't panic. I've almost finished setting up the seismograph probes. Davis, hurry up. 
CLENT: Yes, but the ioniser's nearly at disintegration point. 
ARDEN [on monitor]: Oh, I wonder if Penley's ears are burning. 
CLENT: It's not a laughing matter, man! You know what it means. 
ARDEN [on monitor]: Yes. Cold weather ahead. I thought it felt a bit nippy. 
CLENT: There'll be a full enquiry into your delay, you realise that. 
ARDEN [on monitor]: Yes, and I've got a very good reason. A fantastic discovery in the ice. 
CLENT: Your task was to set up movement probes in the ice, not indulge in amateur archaeology. 
ARDEN [on monitor]: This is a man! 
CLENT: Oh, congratulations. Makes a change from fossils. Now leave it and return. 
ARDEN [on monitor]: I'm bringing the body back with me. 
CLENT: Arden. 
ARDEN [on monitor]: I'm sorry, I can't hear you. There seems to some interference. 
CLENT: Arden!

[Corridor]

(They could easily be in a stately house. A female torso statue in an alcove, ornate Regency-style chairs and side tables, portraits on the wall.) 
VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor, it's just like my home. 
DOCTOR: I know! 
JAMIE: We could be 
ANNOUNCER [OC]: Red state emergency. Evacuation phase three. Phase three evacuate. Transport section leaders report now. Phase three evacuation. 
DOCTOR: Something's wrong. 
VICTORIA: It seems safe enough. 
(A woman walks towards them.) 
DOCTOR: We're discovered. 
(She pins labels on the travellers.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. 
JAMIE: Thank you. Excuse me, miss, I'm Jamie McCrimmon, do you think you could tell us where we are? 
(The woman walks away.) 
DOCTOR: She doesn't want to know, Jamie. 
VICTORIA: Hey, this says we're on evacuation flight seven. 
DOCTOR: Rather inhospitable. We've only just arrived. 
JAMIE: Hey, and this tag, it says I'm a scavenger. And yours does too! Here, we're not beggars. 
DOCTOR: Hush, Jamie. 
VICTORIA: What is it Doctor? 
(The Doctor listens at a door.) 
DOCTOR: It sounds like electronic machinery. Like a computer. There's something wrong with it's pitch. 
VICTORIA: Oh, no. Now look, it might be dangerous. Now let's leave it. 
DOCTOR: No. 
VICTORIA: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Let's go in.

[Ioniser control room]

(Clent is making notes on a pad.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, there's something very wrong here. 
CLENT: Now is (something) still out of phase? Seven two point four. 
DOCTOR: Seven two point four? That's bad. 
(The Doctor follows Clent around the control desks.) 
CLENT: Now balance those gauges, Miss Henry. 17 degrees out of norm. 
DOCTOR: 17 degrees? Well, this is serious! 
CLENT: Miss (something), report to me 
GARRETT: level will you? Minus one seven degrees. 
CLENT: One three seven-nine. 
DOCTOR: One three seven nine? Excuse me, I 
CLENT: Who the blazes are you? Get these scavengers out of here, quick! 
DOCTOR: No! We're not scavengers! 
(General shouting as security try to grab the Doctor's coat.) 
DOCTOR: No! In two minutes thirty eight seconds, you're going to have an almighty explosion! The readings say so! 
CLENT: Well how can you possibly know that? I haven't even, I haven't even processed them through the computer yet! 
DOCTOR: I don't need a computer. 
GARRETT: If he's right it's already too late to escape. 
DOCTOR: No, it isn't. It doesn't have to happen. If you'll excuse me. 
(The Doctor runs round the control desks, giving instructions.) 
DOCTOR: Cut out the reactor link for a start! Uncouple the transformer unit. (something) the density phase and power. 
GARRETT: There's insufficient power for that. 
DOCTOR: Well, a quick short burst then from the reactor unit, now. Off! Now link the circuits with the reactor link. Now, bring in the computer stabiliser. Yes, that should hold it steady. It's not a perfect job, mind you. You ought to get an expert in, you know. 
CLENT: How did you? It was all a bluff, wasn't it, that two minutes thirty eight seconds to danger. 
DOCTOR: Oh no, it was near enough correct. Give or take a second. 
CLENT: Rubbish. 
DOCTOR: Check it on your precious computer then. 
CLENT: Miss Garrett, do so. 
(Garrett reads Clent's notes to the central terminal.) 
GARRETT: Ioniser fall rate, seven two point four. Ion compensator, minus one seven degrees. Ion flow rate, one three seven nine. Assessment please. 
COMPUTER: Immediate emergency. In two minutes thirty seven seconds, the reactor will explode. 
DOCTOR: Well, a second out. We can't all be perfect. 
GARRETT: We're at half power now, Leader Clent. 
CLENT: Why, even Penley couldn't have done better. Where on earth did you spring from? It doesn't matter. Now look 
(Clent wobbles and puts his hand to his head.) 
DOCTOR: What's the matter? 
GARRETT: Are you all right? 
CLENT: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No, no, it's nothing. It's just an emergency added to a ten hour duty spell. 
GARRETT: The vibro-chair. 
CLENT: Yes, you're right. Contact the Medi-Control centre the moment there's a further downward fluctuation. We'll talk at the same time, come with me. (he leaves the room) 
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, Jamie, (something) 
JAMIE: Ask him where we are.

[Glacier face]

(There's a sort of humanoid inside the ice, towering above the men.) 
ARDEN: A giant among prehistoric men. 
WALTERS: See the kind of armour he's got on? 
ARDEN: Yes, that's rather strange. He looks pre-Viking. But no such civilisation existed in pre-historic times, before the first ice age. 
WALTERS: Proper Ice Warrior, isn't he, sir? I reckon Leader Clent'll be interested. 
ARDEN: Yes. What'll the mighty computer make of it, ay? 
WALTERS: Sir, hadn't we better get back while the weather still holds? 
ARDEN: Good point, Walters. Davis, try bringing the air-sled a little closer, will you? 
(Davis walks out into the storm, watched by Storr and Penley, sheltering in another finger of the glacier face.) 
STORR: What are they up to? 
PENLEY: Arden's found something in the ice. Something to take back to Clent. It won't be appreciated. 
STORR: Aye, they ought to leave way alone. 
PENLEY: Arden was always a researcher. He wanted to be an archaeologist when I knew him. 
STORR: Archaeology. What good's that? 
PENLEY: It's good to know things, even when they're dead. 
STORR: Nothing's sacred to you, is it? 
PENLEY: I only ask questions. It's in my character, I suppose. 
STORR: Aye, you swore you'd give all that up. 
PENLEY: Discovery is as exciting to me as the hunt is to you. But with Clent, he uses scientists craniums as stepping stones for his ambitions. 
STORR: Aye, that's about all you lot are fit for. Door steps. 
PENLEY: Well we're not totally useless, surely? 
STORR: To me you are. Come one, we've got to move. Leave them to their stupid games. 
(Penley and Storr walk out into the storm, then take cover as Davies is coming back. He looks up as a wall of snow falls off the ice face above him.) 
WALTERS: Avalanche! Come on! 
PENLEY: Look out! Avalanche! 
(Davis is swept off his feet and down into a crevasse in front of the glacier face.) PENLEY: Storr, are you alright? 
STORR: Penley. 
PENLEY: What's the damage? 
STORR: My arm. It's gone, I think. 
PENLEY: Broken? 
STORR: Feels like it. 
PENLEY: Well, you're lucky. There's one down there who's staying on the mountain for good. 
STORR: They'll come looking for him. We must move out a bit. Unless you fancy trying to turn me over to your friends. 
PENLEY: Six weeks ago they were my friends, but not any more. Can you walk? 
STORR: Aye. Just you try and keep up. Come on. 
WALTERS: All clear, sir. 
ARDEN: Yes, but how about Davis? 
WALTERS: I'll go look for him. 
ARDEN: Well, let's hope he's safe. With another man gone, Clent'll skin me alive. 
WALTERS: Well, if he gets too difficult, you can always set your warrior on him, hey, sir?

[Medi-control centre]

(Clent is reclining on a chair. There is hi-tech equipment scattered around and bookshelves line the walls.) 
CLENT: But you've no valid proof of your qualifications? 
DOCTOR: Look, aren't we wasting time? If you want our help, why not tell us all about it? 
CLENT: All about it? All about what? Where have you been all these years? 
DOCTOR: Well, as a matter of fact, we've been in retreat. In Tibet. We are sanctifiers. 
CLENT: Oh, I see. In Tibet. Well, if you'll take a simple test, I'll soon know if you're up to our scientific standards. 
DOCTOR: I see. And if I fail? 
CLENT: You'll be evacuated with the other scavengers in due course. 
JAMIE: Oh, where to? 
GARRETT: The African rehabilitation centres, of course. 
VICTORIA: Oh, no, not Africa. 
DOCTOR: Very well, fire away. 
CLENT: I present you a problem. All the major continents are threatened with destruction under the glaciers of the second ice age. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
CLENT: How would you halt the ice surge and turn the climate back to normal? Forty five seconds starting from now. 
(Garrett starts the countdown.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, possible causes. The reversal of the magnetic field. 
CLENT: No such change has occurred. 
DOCTOR: Interstellar clouds obscuring the suns rays? An excessive burst of sunspot activity. A severe shift of the Earth's angle of rotation. 
VICTORIA: Come on, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: There aren't that many alternatives. Gigantic heat loss? 
CLENT: I asked for an answer, not a question. Twelve seconds left. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, well, in that case the answer's simple. A severe drop in the carbon dioxide level in the Earth's lower atmosphere. Is that it? 
I would use ionisation. 
(The timer goes ding!) 
JAMIE: Well, is he right? 
(Clent stands up.) 
CLENT: Yes, he is. 
VICTORIA: Oh. But I still don't understand. 
DOCTOR: Well, the carbon dioxide level in the Earth's atmosphere helps retain the sun's heat. Take that gas away, and there's a sudden freeze up. 
JAMIE: Oh, where does the gas go to? 
DOCTOR: Well 
CLENT: You know how efficient our civilisation is, thanks to the direction of the great World Computer. And you also know how we conquered the problem of world famine a century ago by artificial foods. 
(Clent gets himself one of these from a dispenser.) 
CLENT: On the land that was once used to grow the food we needed, we built up to date living units, to house the ever-increasing population. 
DOCTOR: Up to date? 
CLENT: Well, there were exceptions, of course. I mean, this house was classified as being of historic interest. So, the amount of growing plants on the planet, was reduced to an absolute minimum. 
DOCTOR: No plants, no carbon dioxide. 
CLENT: Then suddenly, one year, there was no spring. Even then it wasn't understood. Not until the ice-caps began to advance. 
JAMIE: But, what's this ioniser? 
CLENT: Miss Garrett. 
GARRETT: Ionisation is a method of intensifying the sun's heat onto the Earth, but into particular areas. 
DOCTOR: Yeah, it's like a magnifying glass, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Oh, aye. 
VICTORIA: You mean you can melt glaciers and change the weather? 
CLENT: When certain difficulties are overcome. 
GARRETT: Precise control is not easy. 
CLENT: We can't afford to make mistakes. Ionisation can produce temperatures intense enough to melt rock. 
GARRETT: Only by maintaining a perfect balance can we prevent widespread flooding. 
DOCTOR: Can't your computers solve the problem of control? 
GARRETT: Of course they can. 
DOCTOR: Well. 
GARRETT: When the imprint data is complete they will give us the solution. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. And when will that be? 
GARRETT: Soon, Doctor, soon. 
DOCTOR: What's the position now? 
CLENT: Well, we're barely holding the glacier in check. Now, there you see a world map of the situation at the moment. And there you see what's going on in our sector. But if we fail, then not only will Europe be swallowed up, but the balance of power will be ruined, and the whole world programme will go under. 
DOCTOR: And the glaciers will win. I see. 
CLENT: My senior scientist, Penley, is missing. I think you have the capabilities to join us here in this great mission. Will you help us? 
DOCTOR: Well I'm willing to try. 
CLENT: Jolly good. Jolly good. Miss Garrett will give you some background information. You've worked with computers, I presume? 
DOCTOR: Only when I have to. 
GARRETT: Well, Miss Garrett is our computer specialist. She'll help you. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I'll try and remember that. 
GARRETT: Here we are completely computerised. 
DOCTOR: Well, never mind. 
GARRETT: Every decision is checked to eliminate risk of failure. Because of course, all decisions, all actions, must conform to the common good.

[Corridor]

(Arden is leading the way, and the ice-encased Warrior is being brought along on a gurney.) 
ARDEN: This way, gentlemen, this way. Right. Now do be careful. Around here. Steady with her.

[Medi-control centre]

(Clent is on the vibro-chair when Arden brings his prize into the room.) 
CLENT: Is this what you call your full co-operation, Arden? How do you expect us to carry out this 
JAMIE: There's something in it. 
CLENT: Great heavens. 
ARDEN: Yes, I thought you'd be impressed Clent. Right, chaps. Let's have him over here. Curtain up. This way. Head this way, tail down there. 
VICTORIA: What is it? 
JAMIE: It looks like a Viking warrior. Look at the helmet. 
DOCTOR: Frozen for centuries in the ice. Perfectly preserved. Ooo, that's odd though. 
JAMIE: What? 
ARDEN: Who are you? 
CLENT: An addition to our staff, Arden. What's odd, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well the helmet, it's wrong. When this man was frozen to death only primitive cavemen existed. 
ARDEN: Well I say it's an undiscovered civilisation. Think of the implications. 
CLENT: Well, whatever the implications, it must still take second place to out ioniser project. We have our daily planning conference in three minutes fifteen seconds exactly. Come along, Arden! Play with your toy after the meeting. 
(Clent, Garrett and Arden leave.) 
JAMIE: Well, what's supposed to happen, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: You see, this fellow Arden has set the electricity so that the ice melts very slowly, allowing for the resistance. 
VICTORIA: It's working quite quickly. 
DOCTOR: Well, I suspect there are some impurities in the ice. I say. Look at that. 
JAMIE: What is it? 
DOCTOR: It's an electronic connection. I'm sure of it. 
VICTORIA: It can't be. 
DOCTOR: Now you wait here, and don't touch anything. 
(The Doctor turns a dial and leaves. The curtain comes back down blocking the ice off from the rest of the room.) 
JAMIE: What's got into him all of a sudden? 
VICTORIA: I don't know. Scientists are all alike. Eureka and all that. 
JAMIE: Aye. He could do with a go on this, maybe. 
(Jamie lies on the vibro-chair. Behind the curtain, chunks of ice are quickly falling off a very non-human figure with no fingers on its hands.) 
JAMIE: Victoria? 
VICTORIA: What? 
JAMIE: You see how those lassies were dressed? 
VICTORIA: Yes, I did. And trust you to think of something like that. 
JAMIE: Well, I couldn't help thinking about it. 
VICTORIA: Well, I think it's disgusting, wearing that kind of thing. 
JAMIE: Oh, aye, so it is, so it is. You don't see yourself dressed like that then? 
VICTORIA: Jamie! 
JAMIE: Oh, I'm sorry. It was just an idea. 
VICTORIA: We will now change the subject, please. I want to look at this man. 
(Behind the curtain, the warrior flexes his rubber claw, opens his mouth and moves his head. It's alive!)

Episode Two

[Medi-control centre]

VICTORIA: Jamie! 
(Hissing, the Warrior overpowers Jamie and takes Victoria away with him.)

[Ioniser control room]

CLENT: He took just forty five seconds to propose ionisation. No prior knowledge. 
ARDEN: Well, it took us and the Academy of Scientists years. 
GARRETT: The computer took three milliseconds. 
ARDEN: Yes, well, we had to programme it first. 
CLENT: Quite. Well, before I make a final decision, I want the computer's assessment on this Doctor. 
GARRETT: We must be absolutely sure. 
CLENT: State the work potential and community value of the Doctor. 
COMPUTER: More information is necessary for a full evaluation. High IQ but undisciplined for our needs. Present evaluation, to be used on research projects, but could be obstructive in certain situations. 
(The Doctor enters.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, there you are. 
CLENT: Doctor, would you mind 
DOCTOR: I've been looking everywhere. Why don't you label your doors? 
CLENT: Yes, this is a private meeting. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I realise that, and I'm sorry. 
CLENT: And we have not yet completed our business. 
DOCTOR: Look, I wouldn't intrude if I didn't think it necessary. What I have to say is extremely important. After all, you did ask me to help you, didn't you? 
ARDEN: Has something happened to the warrior? 
DOCTOR: Well, it has something to do with that, yes. 
CLENT: We have more serious matters on hand. 
DOCTOR: This is serious! 
ARDEN: Now let him tell us, Clent. Well? 
DOCTOR: Thank you. It's the, it's the helmet. It's not what we thought it was. 
CLENT: It's a prehistoric drinking cup. 
DOCTOR: No! It has electronic connections. 
CLENT: E? What are you talking about? 
ARDEN: But that's impossible. You must be mistaken. 
DOCTOR: No, I'm positive. You realise what this means? 
ARDEN: Well it must mean the civilisation he came from must be more advanced than we thought. 
DOCTOR: Yes, indeed. They even had astronauts, it appears. 
CLENT: How do you mean? 
DOCTOR: This headpiece is no warriors tin-hat. It's a highly sophisticated space helmet! 
CLENT: Aren't you jumping to conclusions, Doctor, for a scientist? 
ARDEN: But if this is true? 
DOCTOR: If this is true your project is in danger. 
CLENT: In what way? How can one preserved body, however old, effect us? 
DOCTOR: How did he get here? Well, he didn't walk, did he? 
CLENT: Well, if what you say is true, by spaceship. 
DOCTOR: Yes, and where is that spaceship now? 
ARDEN: In the glacier. Then it must still be intact. He had no signs of mutilation. He couldn't have crashed. He must of landed. Clent, can't you see the importance of such a discovery? 
CLENT: The propulsion unit of the spacecraft is probably 
GARRETT: Probably atomic powered. 
CLENT: Quite. And, er, if we use the ioniser at full power 
DOCTOR: This reactor pile could be exploded or be activated. 
CLENT: But if we don't 
GARRETT: The whole area will be contaminated. 
CLENT: But if we don't use the ioniser, what then? We are part of a world plan. Now, if we hold back that plan cannot go into operation. 
GARRETT: We could hold it at minimal power. 
CLENT: Not good enough. 
ARDEN: No, we daren't take the risk. The contamination level would last for five decades or more. 
CLENT: It merely makes the fine control of the heat level even more vital. 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I thought you ought to know. 
CLENT: Yes, you were right, thank you. I must inform the computer immediately for its decision. 
ARDEN: Well, we shall need more facts. 
CLENT: Well, furnish me with facts then! 
(Jamie enters.) 
JAMIE: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
JAMIE: The warrior's come alive! 
ARDEN: Alive? 
CLENT, DOCTOR + GARRETT: What? 
JAMIE: He's taken Victoria. I couldn't stop him! 
ARDEN: Alive. and I found it.

[Medi-control centre]

CLENT: Alive? 
DOCTOR: Strange. 
CLENT: How did it happen? 
JAMIE: Well, we were just talking, and I turned, and there he was standing right next to us. 
ARDEN: That's impossible. To be preserved, yes, but to come alive? Impossible. 
DOCTOR: For a human being, maybe. 
ARDEN: What, not human? 
DOCTOR: Look at this table. 
CLENT: Well, it's been burned. 
ARDEN: Well, I used a low voltage especially. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but a high current. 
ARDEN: Yes but it was quite safe. 
DOCTOR: But if that current passed through a low resistance. 
GARRETT: Extremely high temperatures. 
CLENT: The intense heat must have shocked him back into life. 
JAMIE: Oh look, I don't know what you're all talking about, but all I know is Victoria's in danger and what are we doing to save her? 
DOCTOR: Yes Jamie, you're right. Come on. She can't have gone far. 
JAMIE: Well, come on then.

[Ioniser control room]

CLENT: Danger red alert, danger red alert. Intruders within perimeter. Capture and control. Priority one. Repeat to all posts. 
JAMIE: But within a perimeter? But supposing they're way out of it? 
ANNOUNCER [OC]: Danger red alert, danger red alert. Intruders within perimeter. Capture and control. Priority one. 
CLENT: Well, that'll be just too bad. Obviously I can't release men for an extensive search outside the base. 
DOCTOR: But she may be in danger of her life! You can't take that decision! 
CLENT: Very well. You want an impartial opinion? I shall ask the computer. 
JAMIE: Oh, not the computer. 
DOCTOR: It's a waste of time asking the computer.

[Storage room]

VICTORIA: Who are you? 
VARGA: (hissing) Varga. 
(Believe it or not, that is Bernard Bresslaw underneath all that fibreglass.) 
VICTORIA: Where are you from? 
VARGA: From the Red Planet. 
VICTORIA: Mars? We thought you were dead and then you came alive. What happened? 
VARGA: Too many questions. 
VICTORIA: I'm curious, that's all. 
VARGA: I need answers from you. 
VICTORIA: I don't think I can help you very much. 
VARGA: Answers. 
VICTORIA: Is that a gun? 
VARGA: How long was I in the ice? 
VICTORIA: I don't know, I. One of the scientists said you must have been there since the first ice age. Thousands of years ago. 
VARGA: That cannot be true. 
VICTORIA: Were there others with you? 
VARGA: Yes. Our spaceship crashed at the foot of the ice mountain. As we came out to investigate, a great avalanche of snow buried us. 
VICTORIA: Then the others are still trapped in the glacier, then. 
VARGA: I will free them. Then we will return to the Red Planet. 
VICTORIA: How? You can't get them out by yourself. 
VARGA: You will help. How was I brought to life? 
VICTORIA: Let the scientists here on Earth help you. 
VARGA: Tell me! They would not help me. They would keep me as a curiosity, and they would leave my warriors for dead, or destroy them. 
VICTORIA: No. No, they, they wouldn't. 
VARGA: But with my men, I can talk from strength. Then we shall decide. 
VICTORIA: Decide? Decide what? 
VARGA: Whether to go back to our own world, or to conquer this.

[Ioniser control room]

CLENT: All relevant factors now presented. How should we act? 
JAMIE: Och, how's a machine to know? 
DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie, have patience. Give it a chance. 
COMPUTER: Ionisation programme should continue as planned. A limited number of lives are expected to be lost. 
JAMIE: What about Victoria, though? 
DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie. 
COMPUTER: However, the suspected presence of an alien spacecraft must be investigated, in case of potentially fissionable material. 
JAMIE: Spacecraft! Hey, do you reckon that's where the warrior's gone back to? 
DOCTOR: Well, he didn't come by Shetland Pony, Jamie. 
COMPUTER: In order to accommodate this priority the workload has been rescheduled to free one scientist investigator. 
CLENT: Who should be released? 
COMPUTER: Scientist Arden. 
CLENT: Well, Arden, do you think you could handle this ice giant single-handed? 
ARDEN: Well, I shall need at least one guard. 
JAMIE: Well, what about me then? I could go with him. 
DOCTOR: Yes, he's a capable lad. 
CLENT: Well, the computer said one investigator only. 
DOCTOR: That was from your staff, Jamie's extra. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
GARRETT: The mission must be carried out. The computer has ordered it. 
CLENT: As the Doctor has agreed to help us with the ioniser. Yes, very well, the boy can go. 
DOCTOR: Oh good. 
CLENT: But you must leave immediately, because the sooner we know whether there is a reactor buried inside that glacier or not, the better. 
JAMIE: Aye, maybe, but Victoria's important too, you know. 
CLENT: You don't seem to realise, boy, the fate of the world could be at stake. The girl must take her chance.

[Plant museum]

STORR: What ye trying to do? Cripple me? 
PENLEY: You know the trouble with you. Storr? You're just stupid. 
STORR: How was I to know it would get infected? 
PENLEY: If you'd listened to me in the first place. 
STORR: Aye, you'd have stuffed me to the eyeballs with anti-this and anti-that. I'd have been flat on my back for weeks. 
PENLEY: Where as now, you're fighting fit. 
STORR: Ach, well, someone has to do things. 
PENLEY: Mmm. Well, that someone isn't going to be you. 
STORR: Ach, it's nothing. I'll pull through. 
PENLEY: Yes, I'm rather afraid you will. But if you don't do what I say you'll soon be in a coma, which at least would give me a bit of peace. 
STORR: Don't try scare me with all that scientific guff. 
PENLEY: I'm just telling you, Storr. You got a headache? 
STORR: Ach, it's nothing. 
PENLEY: What I like about you is if a polar bear got you you'd give him indigestion. Feeling fuzzy in the head, eh? 
STORR: I will not let it beat me. Is it going to be bad? 
PENLEY: You won't know much about it. 
STORR: My mouth's dry. 
PENLEY: Here's a what do you call it? A tomato. It's nearly ripe. 
STORR: Ach, you shouldnae have done that. I've been waiting weeks for that to ripen properly. 
PENLEY: Take it, it'll do you good. 
STORR: Ach. 
PENLEY: Well, there are advantages to living in a plant museum, even this close to the glacier. 
STORR: Ah, so even a scientist can appreciate it then? 
PENLEY: Well, there's warmth and food. Selected ancient food plants. Tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, strawberries. A world out of Atlantis. 
STORR: Aye, helps me picture how it was before they killed off all the plants. There was spring then, and flowers. You could pick the fruit off the trees. Now you rotten scientists (coughs) drop down dead. 
PENLEY: Even so it's not the nicest way to live. 
STORR: Aye. 
PENLEY: An avalanche waiting on your doorstep. 
STORR: Not leaving here until I have to. 
PENLEY: Granted. 
STORR: You're not going out after food, are you? You wouldn't know what to do without me. Where are you going, anyway? 
PENLEY: Well I've learnt enough from you to take care of myself, and it's for your idiotic sake that I'm going. 
STORR: Where to? 
PENLEY: The base. 
STORR: You're going to hand me in to rehabilitation. Africa. Never trust anybody. 
PENLEY: I'm going for drugs. And if I don't get them, you're as good as dead.

[Storage room]

VICTORIA: It's, it's, it's, it's a 
VARGA: Go on. 
VICTORIA: It's a black box with wires. They connected it to you, and you came alive. I, well, I don't know how! 
VARGA: A power source. Resistance. A great heat and then life. This room we came from. We will go back to it. 
VICTORIA: I'll tell you how to get there. 
VARGA: You will take me there. Without that power unit, my warriors are lifeless. 
VICTORIA: But we have to go down the corridors. Supposing someone sees you? 
VARGA: I shall kill them. And you. 
VICTORIA: Me? 
VARGA: If you call for help. 
VICTORIA: What is that? 
VARGA: Sonic gun. It will burst your brain with noise.

[Glacier face]

JAMIE: There's no one been here. There's not a mark. 
ARDEN: Well, we didn't pass them on the way. Now, stand aside lad, will you? 
JAMIE: We were wrong, then. He's lost out there somewhere, Victoria with him. 
ARDEN: I can't get a reading. There's something inside there, but all it's doing is creating havoc with this radiation sensor. Arden calling Leader Clent. Arden calling Leader Clent, answer please. 
CLENT [on screen]: Clent here. Report. 
ARDEN: There's no sign of the fugitive or the girl. They didn't, couldn't have come this way. 
CLENT [on screen]: That was not the purpose of your mission. Please report correctly. 
ARDEN: No reading obtainable. The sensor is being jammed by some sort of a screening device. I can't make head nor tail of it. 
CLENT [on screen]: But something is in there. 
ARDEN: Correct. 
CLENT [on screen]: Well, come on then, man! Don't waste time. Go in and find out what it is! 
ARDEN: Well, not with the equipment I have with me now. 
CLENT [on screen]: Very well then, return at once. The mission will be repeated with the correct equipment. 
ARDEN: But this is the proper equipment for the job. 
CLENT [on screen]: Obviously not. Don't waste time. Return immediately. Out. 
JAMIE: A nice boss you've got there. 
ARDEN: Yes. The trouble with Clent is that he's not a proper scientist, he's an organiser. He should've been born a robot. 
JAMIE: Let's go on.

[Corridor]

VICTORIA: No, no, it's not in there. It's further down the corridor.

[Medi-control centre]

VARGA: The black box. Find it, quickly.

[Ioniser control room]

GARRETT: It's still on half power, but it's holding well. 
CLENT: Good. Well? 
DOCTOR: Well, I still think you ought to get in an expert. Why can't you get one? 
CLENT: I choose not to. 
DOCTOR: But why? 
CLENT: You're not here to question me. 
DOCTOR: No, I'm here to help you, if I choose. 
CLENT: This is the most important job I've ever had. Now, every other project I've handled with ease. Nothing has failed. I was chosen because I never fail. When I handpicked the team, I made one vital mistake. 
DOCTOR: This chap Penley. 
CLENT: Best man in Europe for ionisation studies. As it turned out, hopelessly temperamental. 
DOCTOR: Temperamental or individual? Creative scientists have to be allowed some head you know. 
CLENT: Creative? Poppycock. When he walked out of here he proclaimed himself to be criminally, criminally irresponsible. 
DOCTOR: It couldn't have been just a simple gesture of protest? 
CLENT: He was always protesting. This is a team, a team with a mission. If we fail, others cannot succeed. 
DOCTOR: And your name will suffer. That's important. 
CLENT: I lead the team. I depend on the experts I picked. My judgement was sound. Others won't see it that way. 
DOCTOR: So you do need Penley. 
CLENT: No, I do not need Penley. But I do need an equivalent brain. But it would be months before anyone else could pick up the knowledge that Penley acquired here. Just isn't time, that's the pertinent issue. 
DOCTOR: Well, I'll try and help you, but I do think you might try trusting human beings instead of computers. 
CLENT: I trust no one, Doctor. Not any more. Human emotions are unreliable. I'll just go and see that the working area reserved for you in the Medi-Control Centre is ready.

[Medi-control centre]

VARGA: The power pack. 
VICTORIA: I'm looking! 
(Something falls and she jumps.) 
VICTORIA: Yes, yes, they look like the one. Yes, yes. 
VARGA: You are coming with me, to the ice mountain. 
VICTORIA: No, please. 
(Clent enters.) 
CLENT: Who are you? 
(Varga knocks out Clent.) 
VICTORIA: You killed him! 
VARGA: Come. 
(Varga and Victoria leave. Penley comes out of hiding and the Doctor enters.) 
PENLEY: I er, I was going to give him this. 
DOCTOR: Oh, that's disgusting. It's just the thing. Did you do this? 
PENLEY: I've come very close to it at times. I've never seen him look so peaceful. 
DOCTOR: Oh, he'll be all right. Did you see who did do it? 
PENLEY: Yes. A monstrous looking creature. I didn't like the look of him at all. 
DOCTOR: Was there a girl there? 
PENLEY: Yes, she seemed scared stiff. 
DOCTOR: Well, why didn't you try and stop them? 
PENLEY: Well, I came here to get some drugs for a man who is sick. I couldn't run the risk of getting caught. 
DOCTOR: But she's only a young girl! 
PENLEY: She's alive. My friend will die if I don't get back. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I see. 
PENLEY: Are you going after them? I can take you part of the way. 
DOCTOR: No, no, they're searching already. There's a red alarm all over the base. 
PENLEY: Well, I've got what I want. I'm off. 
DOCTOR: Penley? 
PENLEY: You know about me then. My escapades in computer-land. 
DOCTOR: They need you here, you know. They need you desperately. 
PENLEY: Needing isn't getting. I'm free of their problems for good. 
DOCTOR: They're your problems too, you know. It's your world. 
PENLEY: My world is up here. Private and no admittance. Well, I'm going to go then. 
DOCTOR: I expect you know what you're doing. 
PENLEY: You know it's nice to meet one that they haven't got at yet. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. 
PENLEY: Goodbye. 
DOCTOR: Goodbye. 
(Penley leaves. The Doctor puts the smelling salts under Clent's nose.) 
GARRETT [OC]: They're in here. 
(Garrett, Jamie and Arden enter.) 
DOCTOR: Where's Victoria? 
GARRETT: Leader Clent! 
ARDEN: What's happened? 
CLENT: Where are they? 
GARRETT: I've just had a message from the perimeter gate. He smashed his way through, taking the girl with him. 
CLENT: He knocked me out with a power pack. 
DOCTOR: With a power pack? You mean the one that you used to unfreeze him? 
CLENT: Yes. And he and the girl have many more. 
ARDEN: To revitalise others like himself. 
CLENT: Others? What do you mean. We don't know that there are others. 
JAMIE: Well now, he'll head for the glacier. Let's get way after him. 
DOCTOR: No. That's what he wants us to do. That's why he's taken Victoria with him as a hostage. No, we must let him show his hand first. 
JAMIE: But we can't just stand around waiting? 
DOCTOR: We're not going to. Only until morning. That'll be time enough. 
CLENT: No, now! Must I remind you of the mission that you have yet to accomplish? 
ARDEN: Oh no, Clent, not at night. Not for you or anybody. You've never been out there at night.

[Glacier face]

(Varga uses a tracker to find his men in the ice.) 
VARGA: I have located my warriors. When your friends come after us, they will find a surprise. 
VICTORIA: What are you going to do? 
VARGA: You'll see. Don't try to run away. 
VICTORIA: I was only going to watch you. 
VARGA: You are going to help me. 
(Varga uses his sonic gun to melt the ice.)

[Plant museum]

PENLEY: Twenty four hours and you'll be your old animal-like self again. And while you're undergoing repairs, Storr, old chap, I'm going to do a bit of hunting myself, up on the glacier. Something strange is happening, Elric Penley, honoured sir. That warrior, that girl, that funny, scruffy looking chap. Something strange indeed. Something disturbing. Something to do with the ice. And if what that particular chap has said is true, if they really need me, it may mean the parting of the ways for us.

[Glacier face]

VARGA: It's done. They are free. And now, to bring them back to life.

Episode Three

[Glacier face]

VARGA: See, it is working. Zondal is coming to life. Zondal. Zondal. Zondal.

[Ioniser control room]

JAMIE: Wish me luck, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: You take care of yourself, Jamie, and keep an eye on Arden. I don't think he quite realises how dangerous this creature is. 
JAMIE: After what's happened here? He must be blind. 
DOCTOR: Well, he's a scientist and a bit inclined to have his head in the air. You know what they're like. 
JAMIE: Aye, I certainly do. 
ARDEN: Are you all ready, lad? 
JAMIE: Aye, let's away. 
DOCTOR: Good luck. 
ARDEN: Now we don't know how many of them there are, so we'll have to tread carefully. 
CLENT: You will not expose yourself to any unnecessary violence, Arden? 
ARDEN: Now listen, Clent, we both know that I'm responsible for what has happened. If I hadn't brought that creature back here in the first place, none of this would have occurred. I also caused the death of Davis. I can't forget that, either. 
CLENT: Well, you just remember your mission, that's all. And no wild sorties after the girl. It's vital that you get your information back to us immediately. 
JAMIE: Look, we'll not leave Victoria to the warriors, if that's what you mean. If there's half a chance of us two 
CLENT: You will take your orders from Scientist Arden! Act according to your priorities, Arden. 
ARDEN: Come along, boy. 
CLENT: Arden? 
ARDEN: Yes? 
CLENT: Don't be to too hard on yourself. Scientists must question, you know. I mean, if I'd been in your shoes I think I'd have done the same. I'd have, I'd have brought it back. So, anyway, good luck. 
DOCTOR: Good luck, Jamie! 
JAMIE: And you, Doctor. 
(Arden and Jamie leave.) 
CLENT: Well, Doctor, let's see you go into action. I'll just get Miss Garrett to take you over the set-up here. 
DOCTOR: Miss Garrett? Oh, no, no. There's no need to go into formalities. 
CLENT: Miss Garrett? I like things done properly. Where is she? 
DOCTOR: Now Clent, just remember I am not a member of your staff. I'm just a working guest, as you might say. 
CLENT: Yes, of course. But this is a formal establishment, and our regulations 
DOCTOR: Your regulations do not apply to me. I work in my own way, freely. 
CLENT: I see. Like Penley. Regulations seemed to bother him, too. Probably caused his eventual breakdown, in fact. 
DOCTOR: Breakdown? I thought you said he defected? 
CLENT: Did I? Well, one thing lead to another, naturally. He was under a great deal of pressure. Just too much for him, that's all. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I see.

[Plant museum]

STORR: A creature growing out of the ice! Bah! 
PENLEY: I assure you that what I saw was very real. And terrifying. 
STORR: You've been out on the mountain too long. It takes some people that way. Especially the brainy ones. 
PENLEY: Hmmm. Very well, don't believe me, but I still intend to find out. 
STORR: Ah well, you can leave me out of your fun and games. I've got enough troubles of my own. 
PENLEY: You're fit enough now. To do the cooking, at least. Thanks to science. 
STORR: Science! Och, it wasn't science, it was just good plain doctoring. And if you smirk again like that, I'll crack your head open with this. 
PENLEY: Yes, you're definitely back to your normal witty self. What's the matter? 
STORR: Someone's outside. 
PENLEY: They must have tracked me here from the base. Hide yourself. We don't want you carted off to Africa yet. You! 
GARRETT: I followed you. It's all right, I'm alone. 
PENLEY: What do you want? 
GARRETT: Elric, we're in desperate trouble at the base. You're the only one who can help us. 
PENLEY: Clent doesn't need me. All he wants is a mirror. Preferably rose-tinted. 
GARRETT: He does need you to make the ioniser work again. 
PENLEY: Is that all? 
GARRETT: No. He's faced with having to report the full situation to World Control. 
PENLEY: Oh well, now we're coming to it, aren't we? The great Clent would have to admit failure. That's it, isn't it? Poor old Clent. He never could face the music. Here, what about this creature at the glacier?
GARRETT: That's only part of our trouble. The real problem is the ioniser. Will you come? 
PENLEY: It's typical of him to send you, instead of armed guards. 
GARRETT: He doesn't know I'm here. I'm asking you. 
PENLEY: I won't come. 
GARRETT: But you can't just step aside. A man like you, living like a scavenger? It's utterly wrong. Civilisation needs you. 
PENLEY: Jane, I chose this existence. I chose it because I refuse to be sucked into that computerised ant-heap you call a civilisation. I'm a man, not a machine. I will not return. 
GARRETT: Not even to save the world? 
PENLEY: Save the world? Well, that has a fine Clentian ring to it. No thanks, no. It'll take more than me to do that. But don't you worry, you don't get rid of my sort all that easily. Machines corrode and rust, but mankind goes on. You'll find Clent one of these days in a museum, like that ancient stove, with an inscription round him. Robotised human mark two, now extinct. But you'll find others like me still alive. 
GARRETT: Surely, Elric, that's all the more reason to come back. To change things. 
PENLEY: Don't you understand, Jane? Clent's just a talker. He's a glib political animal. Even if I did change things, the Clent's of this world would still come out on top. Running things according to their own whims and indulgences. And the pity of it is, they believe they're right. 
GARRETT: Then you leave me no alternative. You will come, and now! 
PENLEY: You must be desperate. But tranquillising me isn't going to make it any easier. You'd never be able to carry me all that way. 
STORR: Oh no you don't! 
GARRETT: Who's this? 
PENLEY: Just a friend. Now what are you going to do? 
GARRETT: Return to base and wait for the inevitable disaster. 
STORR: Oh no, you don't. I'm not having you set the dogs on me. I'd as soon put an end to her game. Give me that. 
PENLEY: Storr, no. She won't put us away. 
GARRETT: No, I won't. 
STORR: I don't trust any of them. 
GARRETT: Please trust me enough to come with me to safety. Apart from the danger of the glacier, these creatures. 
PENLEY: Oh yes, your ice warriors. Well, we shall just have to take our chance. No, I won't return. And now you must go. But if Sir Genius does have trouble with the ioniser, look up my notes on the Omega factor. 
GARRETT: Thank you for that at least. 
(Garrett leaves.) 
STORR: This ice warrior. It's real then. 
PENLEY: Oh yes. And I'm going up there again. 
STORR: But why, man? 
PENLEY: Because I must know. Now, put this knife to more sensible use.

[Glacier face]

VARGA: If you value life, obey, and do not anger us. 
VICTORIA: I want to go back to my friends. 
VARGA: Perhaps later. For the moment, you are useful to us. Zondal. 
ZONDAL: Commander. 
VARGA: You will locate our buried spaceship without delay. 
ZONDAL: That will not be difficult. 
VARGA: You will excavate sufficient space to form a cave. 
ZONDAL: A cave. 
VARGA: To act as a trap. 
VICTORIA: A trap? Who for? 
VARGA: Do not interfere. Your friends may attack us. 
VICTORIA: But they don't want to attack you. They could help you. 
VARGA: We do not need help. 
VICTORIA: You'd still be frozen and dead if it wasn't for us. 
VARGA: You are a child. 
VICTORIA: Oh, why won't you listen? 
VARGA: Commence. 
VICTORIA: What are you going to do with me? 
VARGA: Bait. Bait for the trap. 
ZONDAL: Activate direction sensors. Steady. Sonic stalls ready. Set to wide impact. Take aim. Continuous fire!

[Ioniser control room]

DOCTOR: If I was to reverse the sequence to give a density ratio. Where did I? Yes, here we are. If I reverse the sequence to give a density ratio. Excuse me. Excuse me! Yes. 
CLENT: Genius at work, I see. Good morning Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Mmm? Yes. 
CLENT: Well, this is all very impressive, Doctor, but don't you think it'd be simpler to use a computer? 
DOCTOR: Four. What computer? 
CLENT: The base computer. 
DOCTOR: Six. Yes, they're useful for digital analysis, but I very rarely use them, except when I have to. There is one thing you could do for me which would be very important. 
CLENT: Yes, yes, anything. What is it? 
DOCTOR: Lend me a pencil. Oh, that would be even better. 
CLENT: Doctor, would you mind explaining just what it is that you are 
DOCTOR: Now, this is wrong, this is wrong. It's not right. There's something missing. 
CLENT: Would these figures help? 
DOCTOR: Supposing I? What are they? 
CLENT: Data readings from the other bases. 
DOCTOR: Oh, computer checked, I hope? 
CLENT: Of course. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank heavens for that. 
(Garrett enters.) 
GARRETT: Doctor, I've found something here that I think you might 
CLENT: Where have you been, Miss Garrett? Your instructions were to help the Doctor, were they not? 
GARRETT: Yes, Leader Clent. I have been looking up Scientist Penley's notes. These. Could these help? 
DOCTOR: What are they? Omega. Well, what does he mean? Omega. What does he? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Yes! Yes, of course. The Omega Factor! There and here and there. Yes! Ha ha! Your friend Penley is very clever. 
CLENT: Is that it? 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's it! 
CLENT: That's fantastic. 
DOCTOR: Oh, when you've been at it as long as I have it's nothing. 
GARRETT: Do you think it could possibly work? 
CLENT: It's very possible. 
DOCTOR: Possible? It's perfect! Well, it's nearly perfect. 
CLENT: We shall see. 
DOCTOR: Oh, it'll work, all right. 
CLENT: The computer will confirm that, I'm sure. 
DOCTOR: Computer? 
GARRETT: Well, everything's checked. 
DOCTOR: I resent that! 
CLENT: Just normal practice, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: It should be the other way round. 
CLENT: We have to be quite sure. It'll only take a matter of seconds. Copy all this down, Miss Garrett, and then we can feed it through the computer and do a simulator run. I'll just go and set it up. 
DOCTOR: I shall demand an apology, you know. 
GARRETT: We may not have time for that. 
DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad you had time to look up Penley's notes. 
GARRETT: I thought it might be useful. 
DOCTOR: Pity that he turned traitor. 
GARRETT: Oh, Clent might call him that, but he's still the most brilliant scientist we have. 
DOCTOR: Oh? Oh, it's nice to see he still has some friends in the base.

[Glacier cave]

ARDEN: Glacier task unit. Leader Clent, please. Leader Clent, please.

[Ioniser control room]

CLENT: Clent here. Report. 
ARDEN [on monitor]: We've arrived at the glacier site. There's something strange. 
CLENT: What is? 
ARDEN [on monitor]: The ice face. It's been excavated into a cave. 
DOCTOR: How? 
ARDEN [on monitor]: By some kind of tool, I think. 
CLENT: Is there any sign of a spacecraft? 
ARDEN [on monitor]: Yes. 
DOCTOR: There is? Where? 
ARDEN [on monitor]: Well, at the back of the cave, there's what looks like a metal door in the ice.

[Glacier cave]

ARDEN: The place is apparently deserted. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Well make sure you don't go too near. 
CLENT [on monitor]: Excuse me. Take the necessary readings, and leave quickly, Arden. 
ARDEN: I'll take care. 
JAMIE: What readings? 
ARDEN: Radiation, magnetic field and ion density. Won't take long. 
JAMIE: I don't fancy this place. 
ARDEN: There's never been such a discovery as this. All my life 
(An ice warrior shoots Arden and Jamie.) 
VICTORIA: No! Oh Jamie, no! What have you done to him? You killed them! 
VARGA: It was necessary. 
VICTORIA: Oh, you're monsters! 
VARGA: Remove her inside. 
VICTORIA: Oh, leave me alone! Oh, please. Haven't you done enough? Please, leave me alone! I want to go back! Please! 
ZONDAL: There may be more of them. 
VARGA: If more of them come, we will destroy them. If no more of them come, we will know there are not enough of them to resist us. 
ZONDAL: Let us destroy the girl now. 
VARGA: They came after her. She is obviously of some value to them. 
ZONDAL: Then they will try again. 
VARGA: We shall be ready for them. But first, Zondal, you have a task to complete. The propulsion unit. It must be made to function. Time is vital. You must succeed. 
ZONDAL: Yes, Commander. 
VARGA: Come. 
(Penley creeps out of hiding and drags Jamie away.)

[Ioniser control room]

CLENT: We've just finished programming the computer. We shall have the result very quickly. 
DOCTOR: Isn't it about time that Arden and Jamie reported again? 
CLENT: Yes, that's true. But you know what Arden is, with his scientific curiosity. 
DOCTOR: Yes, very human. I'm worried about them too. 
CLENT: Yes, I'll do it if you don't mind. Leader Clent calling Scientist Arden. Arden? Do you receive me? 
DOCTOR: He's not answering. Perhaps something has happened to them. 
CLENT: It looks as if he's. Arden. For heaven's sake man, come in!

[Glacier cave]

DOCTOR [on monitor]: Jamie, answer me! Jamie, what's happened? Jamie! Jamie!

[Ioniser control room]

DOCTOR: I will never forgive myself if anything's happened to Jamie. 
CLENT: What about this project with Arden missing? 
DOCTOR: Oh, your ioniser will work all right. 
CLENT: I hope so. I'm not sure that I trust your judgement yet, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: What do you mean, I'm only human? Well as a matter of fact 
(Garrett enters.) 
GARRETT: It works! 
DOCTOR: I told you it would. 
GARRETT: The equation works! 
DOCTOR: I told you it would. 
CLENT: Good. Good. Jolly good. Success is at last possible. Inform all ioniser bases, Miss Garrett. Thank you, Doctor. It's a triumph. 
DOCTOR: Very likely. But somewhere, out on that ice face, are two young people for whom I have considerable affection. That is no triumph! 
CLENT: I appreciate your feelings. I, too, have lost a colleague. 
DOCTOR: They're not colleagues, they're friends. 
CLENT: We cannot be sentimental in this situation, Doctor. Our mission continues. We must all play our part. 
DOCTOR: I've played mine. It's finished. 
CLENT: What a triumph. Europe saved. Science the victor over nature, and it happened in my sector. Well, it's not the first time. 
GARRETT: Now we can go ahead. It only needs programming. 
DOCTOR: Aren't you forgetting something? 
CLENT: I'm sorry, but some lives are bound to be lost. 
DOCTOR: No, no, I don't mean that. Arden. He's not yet completed his mission. 
GARRETT: Oh yes, of course. The spaceship reactor. We daren't proceed until we've heard from Arden. 
CLENT: Where is he? Where is he? Where is he?

[Plant museum]

STORR: What did you have to bring him back here for? Another mouth to feed. 
PENLEY: You may hate scientists, Storr, but there's no need to hate all human beings. 
STORR: I don't trust anyone from Clent's base. 
JAMIE: Who are you? Where's Arden? What happened?! Oh, my head. 
PENLEY: Now you must rest. You're suffering from severe shock. Now just lie still. 
JAMIE: Well, where am I? 
STORR: Ah, never you mind. Somewhere safe. 
JAMIE: Well, what happened to me and Arden? 
PENLEY: Arden's dead. You were both shot down by the warriors. 
JAMIE: Arden dead? 
PENLEY: They used some sort of ray gun. 
JAMIE: So we failed. 
STORR: You came to rescue the girl? Is that it? 
JAMIE: You've seen Victoria? Is she still alive? 
PENLEY: Yes, she is alive. 
JAMIE: Then we can still save her! You will help me, please! 
PENLEY: Now you're not yet well enough. We'll discuss it later. 
JAMIE: No, it'll be to late then. They might. Oh, my head. No, you must help me save Victoria. It'll be too late.

[Glacier cave]

(Victoria finds the wrist communicator.) 
VICTORIA: Doctor, if only I could make this thing work. This is Victoria calling the Doctor or Leader Clent. This is Victoria. Please answer me.

[Spacecraft]

ZONDAL: The girl, Commander. She will betray us. 
VARGA: She has courage. But she is also very stupid to think that we would not watch her every move. 
ZONDAL: She must be stopped.

[Ioniser control room]

DOCTOR: It's Victoria! Victoria, where are you? 
VICTORIA [on monitor]: I

[Glacier cave]

VICTORIA: I don't know

[Ioniser control room]

VICTORIA [on monitor]: Some sort of cave. 
DOCTOR: Are you all right? 
VICTORIA [on monitor]: Yes, but, oh Doctor, something terrible's happened! 
DOCTOR: What? 
VICTORIA [on monitor]: They, they've shot Jamie and Arden! 
DOCTOR: What? Well, is he dead? Is, is he wounded? Is he badly wounded? 
VICTORIA [on monitor]: I don't know. 
DOCTOR: What do you mean? 
VICTORIA [on monitor]: Well, he's gone.

[Glacier cave]

VICTORIA: Arden's body's still here and he's dead, but the warriors are from Mars, and. Oh, Doctor, it's horrible! 
CLENT [on monitor]: Keep calm, girl. We want facts. Tell us about the spacecraft first. 
VICTORIA: No, please, please listen to me. Arden's dead, and Jamie's disappeared. 

[Spacecraft]

VICTORIA [on monitor]: Don't you understand? They're ruthless killers and they'll stop at nothing. Now please, listen to me. There's no time to lose. 
ZONDAL: Ready to fire.

Episode Four

[Spacecraft]

(Varga throws a switch and the weapon turret retracts.) 
VARGA: Not yet. 
ZONDAL: She has betrayed us. She must be destroyed. 
VARGA: Let her talk first. 
ZONDAL: They will know our numbers. 
VARGA: They will also know she is alive. She is the bait.

[Ioniser control room]

DOCTOR: Victoria, tell us more about the warriors. 
VICTORIA [on monitor]: They're from Mars. 
CLENT: They're not important. Have you seen the propulsion unit of the spacecraft, girl? 
VICTORIA [on monitor]: Propulsion unit? 
CLENT: The engines. 
VICTORIA [on monitor]: Oh, yes. They're busy repairing them now. 
CLENT: What kind are they? It's vitally important. 
VICTORIA [on monitor]: I have no idea. 
CLENT: Well, reactor turbine? Ion jet? Anti-gravity? Think, girl! 
DOCTOR: Can you describe them to us, Victoria dear? 
VICTORIA [on monitor]: Yes, yes, I think so. 
CLENT: Well hurry, girl! 
VICTORIA: Look, it isn't easy. Now I have to have time to think. 
(The screen fills with static.) 
DOCTOR: Victoria? Victoria, what's happened? Are you all right? Answer me! 
VICTORIA [on monitor]: I'm all right.

[Glacier cave]

VICTORIA: It's the glacier. It's moving all the time. 
DOCTOR [OC]: You're not hurt? 
CLENT [OC]: The engines. Tell us about the engines.

[Spacecraft]

VARGA: She has told them enough. Bring her in. 
ZONDAL: Destroy her. 
VARGA: You are wrong, Zondal. She must answer some questions first. Why are they so interested in our engines? Why are they afraid?

[Ioniser control room]

VICTORIA [on monitor]: There's someone coming. 
DOCTOR: Victoria. Victoria. Can you see the base from where you are? 
VICTORIA [on monitor]: Yes. Yes, I can. 
DOCTOR: Do you think you can get back to it? 
VICTORIA [on monitor]: I can give it a try. 
DOCTOR: Well, get in contact again as soon as you can. Good luck.

[Glacier cave]

(The spacecraft door opens and an Ice Warrior comes out. Victoria runs off into the maze that is the business end of the glacier.)

[Ioniser control room]

DOCTOR: Yes. This is an automatic chemical dispenser, is it not? 
GARRETT: Yes. 
DOCTOR: How does it work? 
CLENT: Well, you choose the category of the article that you want by indicating it on one of these little chaps here. Jolly good. And now you dial the precise chemical formula that you want there. 
DOCTOR: May I? There's something I need rather desperately. 
(The Doctor dials in a short formula. The machine dispenses a sealed plastic cup. The Doctor removes the seal.) 
CLENT: Oh, what's that? 
DOCTOR: Water. 
(The Doctor drinks it.) 
CLENT: Indeed. 
DOCTOR: Ah, that's better. Now then, let's see. Jamie has vanished. 
(The Doctor does more dialing.) 
DOCTOR: Victoria's on her way back to the base. And neither of them can help us with our main problem. 
(The Doctor takes a phial from the dispenser.) 
DOCTOR: An exact description of the spacecrafts propulsion unit. 
GARRETT: That will? 
DOCTOR: I will. 
CLENT: With the help of ammonium sulphide? 
DOCTOR: We know these creatures come from Mars, don't we? What do we know about their planets atmospheric conditions? 
GARRETT: Chiefly nitrogen, with virtually no oxygen or hydrogen. 
DOCTOR: Then they're not going to enjoy this little concoction much, are they? 
CLENT: What? You mean you intend to use it as a kind of toxic gas? 
DOCTOR: Well, if I'm going to an alien spaceship it may come in handy. 
CLENT: Now don't be ridiculous. We've lost Arden already. 
DOCTOR: Arden fell into a trap. I know what to expect. 
CLENT: I refuse to allow you to go! 
DOCTOR: Splendid! You go instead then! 
GARRETT: No one can be spared. Least of all Leader Clent. 
DOCTOR: I can be spared. I've done all I can here. The ioniser will work without me. I'd start getting it ready if I were you. 
CLENT: But if anything goes wrong with the countdown? 
DOCTOR: Oh, you'll manage. 
CLENT: No. 
DOCTOR: It's as simple as this. Someone has to get to the spacecraft, find out what sort of propulsion unit it has, and bring the information back to you, or we can't use the ioniser. Now, who better than me?
CLENT: I've come to regard you as Penley's replacement, and. All right, all right. But it's strictly under protest. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
GARRETT: How will you get the information back to us? 
DOCTOR: Ah. Now I don't suppose you have a small radio transmitter? 
CLENT: No, our video links are the only communicators available. Pure sound is no longer in use. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, you won't see me, but you'll hear me. As soon as I get to the glacier face I'll switch it on and you'll overhear. I hope. 
GARRETT: Is that all you're taking? 
DOCTOR: Why, what else do I need? 
CLENT; But the Warriors are armed. 
DOCTOR: But I'm not going to fight a duel. 
GARRETT: But you must be in a position to defend yourself. They'll try to kill you out of hand. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so. This is my defence. 
CLENT: But how can you rely on that? They've already proved themselves to be utterly ruthless. 
DOCTOR: I think they'll listen to me. 
GARRETT: You mean you're going to let them take you prisoner? 
DOCTOR: That is exactly what I'm going to do.

[Glacier]

(The ice warrior has found Victoria so she runs deeper into the glacier maze. But it catches up to her again. Victoria screams and runs into what seems to be a dead end. She breaks through a thin ice wall but loses the wrist communicator. Going back for it, she just manages to hide as the ice warrior makes the hole big enough for itself to walk through and past her, almost treading on the communicator as it goes. Victoria goes to pick it up and she is caught. Then an avalanche pours snow down upon them.)

[Plant museum]

PENLEY: He's going to wake. His pulse isn't too good. 
STORR: His fever's gone. 
PENLEY: Well, his body is young. It will heal. 
STORR: Then why you looking so worried? 
PENLEY: I don't know yet. The weapon they used on him. Peculiar. 
STORR: Aye, scientifically designed, of course. 
PENLEY: This is no time for debates. 
STORR: Aye, it's easily said. I'll away and fetch a fresh drink. 
JAMIE: You'll not keep me prisoner! 
PENLEY: Stay still! 
JAMIE: No, get away out of it! 
PENLEY: Storr! 
STORR: Do not fight us. 
JAMIE: You'll not keep me! 
PENLEY: We you're friends! 
STORR: We saved your life. 
JAMIE: Oh, oh my head. 
(Penley puts a compress to Jamie's forehead.) 
JAMIE: What are you doing to me? 
PENLEY: I'm going to try and ease your pain with this tranquilliser pad. 
JAMIE: I don't believe you. 
PENLEY: Now you must trust us. We know about your friend. We may be able to help. 
JAMIE: Victoria? Well, where is she? 
PENLEY: In the alien spaceship. 
JAMIE: Alien? 
PENLEY: These warriors are not of our time, nor of this planet. 
JAMIE: Well, how would you know all that? 
STORR: Ah, because he's a scientist. He can produce an explanation for anything. 
JAMIE: And you? 
STORR: I'm a loyalist. 
JAMIE: A loyalist. 
STORR: Ah, they've told you, have they? 
JAMIE: Aye. But there's no time to talk. I came here to rescue Victoria. 
PENLEY: You're in no state 
JAMIE: Oh, just you try me. Here, give me a hand. 
(Storr helps Jamie to stand.) 
STORR: He's no as bad as you say, Penley. 
JAMIE: No, scientists aren't always right. 
STORR: You hear that, Penley? But your legs are still weak. 
JAMIE: My legs! I can't feel them. I can't stand! 
STORR: Oh, is this what your stupid drugs can do? 
PENLEY: Don't be a fool, Storr. Of course it's not the drugs. 
JAMIE: Well, what is it then? 
PENLEY: Well, their weapons must have affected your central nervous system. 
JAMIE: You mean I'm paralysed?

[Spacecraft]

(Zondal enters.) 
VARGA: Where is the girl? 
ZONDAL: Turoc has not yet returned. 
VARGA: He must find her. 
ZONDAL: Why? 
VARGA: We need her to draw an intelligent being from the base. 
ZONDAL: To find out the kind of reactor they use. 
VARGA: Yes. Without the mercury fuel elements we are helpless. 
ZONDAL: And if they have them? 
VARGA: We shall take them. 
(Two ice warriors enter.) 
VARGA: Is the fuel completely run down? 
(A warrior nods.) 
ZONDAL: If these scientists succeed in melting the ice? 
VARGA: There will be floods. 
ZONDAL: No hope for our engines then. 
VARGA: Or for us. 
ZONDAL: The gun is our only chance.

[Glacier]

VICTORIA: Help! Oh, somebody help me! 
(Victoria is held fast by the ice warrior's 'hand'.) 
VICTORIA: Help! Somebody! 
(More ice falls nearby. Victoria screams, which can't help its stability at all.) 
VICTORIA: Oh please! Help me, somebody! Please help me!

[Plant museum]

PENLEY: Well, there's little more I can do for him. That's the last of the tranquilliser pads. 
STORR: Do ye understand his illness? 
PENLEY: No, and I've no way of knowing the cause. 
STORR: Well, there's one way we can save him. 
PENLEY: How? 
STORR: To befriend the aliens. 
PENLEY: Oh, don't be a fool, Storr. 
STORR: Oh, they'll help us. I'll talk to them. They'll understand. 
PENLEY: But they're warriors, trained to kill. 
STORR: Ach, only in self-defense, surely. 
PENLEY: Oh, rubbish. No. We've got to get the boy back to the base. 
STORR: No! 
PENLEY: For the boys sake. 
STORR: Oh, ye're trying to trap me. There's no return for me to the civilisation that Clent represents. This is where I stay. 
PENLEY: Do you think the aliens are any better? They killed Arden. 
STORR: Ach, they were afraid. 
PENLEY: They're ruthless. They place no value on human life. 
STORR: Well, I'll talk to them. Someone has to. 
PENLEY: We don't know what they're capable of, or why they're here. 
STORR: Well, I'll ask questions first, then act. 
PENLEY: It may be too late then. 
STORR: We'll see. 
PENLEY: No, wait, Storr. Look, you don't know what you're running into. 
STORR: Now don't try and stop me. You look after the boy.

[Glacier]

PENLEY [OC]: Storr! Storr! Storr! Storr! 
(Storr picks up a lump of ice to use on Penley, then - ) 
VICTORIA: Can you hear me! Help! Oh! I'm trapped! 
(Storr leaves. Penley arrives and dodges an icefall then goes in the opposite direction. Further on he finds -) 
DOCTOR: Oh, it's you again, is it? 
PENLEY: Has anyone passed this way? 
DOCTOR: No. Are you looking for someone? 
PENLEY: A rather ragged fellow like me. 
DOCTOR: No, nobody. Not even like me. 
PENLEY: Then I'm too late. There's nothing I can do. 
DOCTOR: Can I help you? 
PENLEY: Well, you've helped me once already. Why didn't you give me away or stop me at the base? 
DOCTOR: Well, why should I? I don't believe everything Clent tells me. 
PENLEY: This boy. He's your friend. 
DOCTOR: You know where he is? Is he hurt? 
PENLEY: Come this way. 
(Meanwhile, elsewhere.) 
VICTORIA: Help me, please! Who are you? 
STORR: Ach, never mind about that now. 
VICTORIA: Would you release me please? 
(Storr pries open the ice warrior's hand.) 
STORR: What happened? 
VICTORIA: I run away and the warrior caught me. The ice fell 
STORR: You ran away? But why? 
VICTORIA: The warriors, they're evil. They killed Arden. I think they want to destroy the base. 
STORR: They are against the scientists? 
VICTORIA: I know, but they won't listen. They think the ioniser is a weapon against them. 
STORR: Aye, it's true. A weapon of destruction. 
VICTORIA: Only to destroy the ice. 
STORR: Ach, it will destroy civilisation. 
VICTORIA: Anyway, thank you. Where were you going? 
STORR: Well, your friend, the boy. 
VICTORIA: Jamie? Jamie is alive? Oh, is he all right? 
STORR: Ah, he's desperately ill. I'm going for help. 
VICTORIA: But where? 
(More ice falls.) 
STORR: We'd better move out of here quickly.

[Glacier cave]

VARGA: Is it ready? 
ZONDAL: We are checking the motivator. Reline harmonic frequencies to target point. When do we attack the base? 
VARGA: Soon, Zondal, soon. Has Turoc returned? 
ZONDAL: Not yet. 
VARGA: The ice, it is alive. 
(The ice warriors conceal themselves.) 
VICTORIA [OC]: The spaceship! 
STORR [OC]: Aye. 
VICTORIA [OC]: You came here on purpose? 
STORR [OC]: Of course! 
VICTORIA: I'm not coming with you! 
STORR: Oh, but you must. We must. We'll be safe. They'll listen to me. 
VICTORIA: But they won't. You can't trust them. 
STORR: Ah, they're against the scientists and the ioniser. That's good enough for me. 
VICTORIA: Is that your reason? I think that's wicked! 
STORR: They'll understand. 
VICTORIA: Let go of me! 
(Storr pulls Victoria forward, straight into Varga.) 
VICTORIA: Oh! 
VARGA: Where is Turoc? 
VICTORIA: He was crushed by the ice. 
VARGA: I give you your life. You run away. Because of that, one of my men is dead. 
VICTORIA: Honestly, it wasn't my fault. 
VARGA: Take her inside. 
VICTORIA: You're not going to kill me, are you? 
(Victoria and an ice warrior leave.) 
STORR: My name is Storr. I'm a scavenger. A loyalist. 
VARGA: You are from the base? 
STORR: No, I'm against the scientists. 
ZONDAL: You know nothing of their machines? 
STORR: No, I don't want to. Their intentions are evil. I want to help you destroy the scientists. 
ZONDAL: You. What good are you to us? 
STORR: Oh, well, I know the land around here. I've lived here all my life. 
VARGA: You are not a scientist, only a local native. 
ZONDAL: Useless and unnecessary. 
STORR: But, but I want to help you. 
(Varga and Zondal fire their wrist guns and kill Storr.) 
VARGA: Now to question the girl.

[Plant museum]

DOCTOR: Yes, there we are. 
JAMIE: It's good to see you again, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Ah, won't be long before you're on your feet again, Jamie. 
JAMIE: How long? 
DOCTOR: Well, that depends. You've had some sort of shock to your brain. It's affected your nervous system. 
JAMIE: I will walk again though? 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, of course you will. It's just a matter of time, that's all. 
JAMIE: Aye, well I'll take your word on that. 
PENLEY: What can we do for him? 
DOCTOR: Well the base is the only place he can be treated. 
PENLEY: Yes I know that, but he can't get there alone. 
(A pane of glass breaks and ice falls in.) 
PENLEY: That's the glacier. It's moving forward even faster. 
DOCTOR: Yes. It'll flatten this place in no time at all. 
PENLEY: All right. I'll help you take him back. 
DOCTOR: Well, that's just it, you see. I can't go. There's something I must do. 
PENLEY: You don't expect me to face Clent alone? That mouth piece of the computer? He's got a printed circuit where his heart should be. 
DOCTOR: He's a man with a mission. I don't think he can afford to reject you. 
PENLEY: Well, that's not the point. Anyway, what are you going to do? 
DOCTOR: I must speak with the warriors. 
JAMIE: No, Doctor! 
PENLEY: What can you do alone? 
DOCTOR: I have to see whether Victoria got away safely, and I must find out whether this spacecraft is a danger to the ionisation programme. I admit it won't be easy. 
JAMIE: Doctor, if you go to the warriors you'll be their prisoner. 
DOCTOR: Their guest I hope, Jamie.

[Ioniser control room]

CLENT: Look, Miss Garrett, look. The glacier moving. That's the fifth surge today. The ioniser just isn't holding it anymore. 
GARRETT: But we daren't increase power beyond the minimal. 
CLENT: Well, I know the risk if the spaceship explodes. Cobalt radioactivity level. We'd only replace one disaster with an even greater one. 
GARRETT: But you must make a decision soon. 
CLENT: No decision to be made yet. Computer can act only when given adequate information. We still don't know enough about the alien reactor. 
GARRETT: But suppose we never know? Suppose the Doctor never returns? 
CLENT: We'll face that if and when we have to. 
GARRETT: But you must have a plan in mind, surely? 
CLENT: I'm pinning all my hopes on the Doctor. He must succeed. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Here we go, Clent old chap. Wish me luck.

[Glacier cave]

(There is more ice falling as the Doctor arrives outside the spaceship. He knocks on the entrance hatch.) 
DOCTOR: Anyone at home? 
(The Doctor sees the weapon by the hatch. It comes out of the bulkhead so the Doctor ducks underneath it and returns to the hatch.) 
DOCTOR: Open up. Come on. Open up, I say! Very well, I shall count to ten. One, two, three. Ah!

[Airlock]

(The hatch opens and the Doctor marches in.) 
VARGA [on monitor]: Who are you? 
DOCTOR: I never answer questions until I'm addressed properly. 
VARGA [on monitor]: You will answer now. Very well. You are standing in the airlock of this spacecraft. Unless you answer my questions within ten seconds, I will take atmospheric pressure around you down to zero. 
DOCTOR: But if you do that my body will explode. 
VARGA: One, two, three, four 
(The pressure gauge on the wall drops rapidly.)

Episode Five

[Airlock]

DOCTOR: All right, all right! I don't think much of your hospitality. 
VARGA [on monitor]: Identify yourself. 
DOCTOR: Me? I'm a scientist. I've come to talk with you.

[Spacecraft]

DOCTOR [on monitor]: To help you. 
VARGA: A scientist? 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Yes. Yes, you could call me that. 
ZONDAL: You do not look like a scientist. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Looks aren't everything, you know. 
VARGA: You look more like a scavenger. We killed him. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Well if you kill me, you'll ruin any chance you may have of escape. 
ZONDAL: Do you think he can help us? 
VARGA: He cannot afford to lie. Allow him to enter. 
(The Doctor enters.) 
DOCTOR: Ah, thank you very much. That's very civil of you. Oh, my word! 
(The Doctor tries to leave but the door has shut.) 
VARGA: You claim to be able to help us. 
DOCTOR: No, I am sure I can help you. On certain conditions. 
VARGA: You are our prisoner. It is we who set conditions. 
(The spacecraft shakes.) 
DOCTOR: On the contrary, it is you who are the prisoner, and I can help you. 
VARGA: Not on your terms. Bring in the girl. Now we will have two hostages. 
DOCTOR: Well, what good will that do? You are buried alive in the heart of this glacier. Time is desperately short. You've got no time to bargain over hostages. 
VARGA: Inside our spaceship, we are safe. And with you here, your base will dare not use their secret weapon against us. 
DOCTOR: Weapon? But the ioniser is not a weapon. 
VARGA: You know how it works? 
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. It'll melt the ice and set you free! 
VICTORIA: You're hurting me! 
DOCTOR: Victoria! 
VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor! Oh dear, but they've got you too. 
DOCTOR: It's all right. We are not beaten yet. 
VICTORIA: What about Jamie? 
DOCTOR: He's alive. 
VARGA: If what you say is true, why have you not freed us before? 
DOCTOR: Well, there are difficulties. 
VARGA: What are they? 
DOCTOR: Well. 
VARGA: You will tell us.

[Snowfield]

(Wolves howl as Penley drags Jamie on a travois through the remains of a forest. It gets stuck.) 
PENLEY: You're caught on a bough or something. Well, it's not much farther now, lad. 
JAMIE: How far are we? 
PENLEY: Well, we're at the edge of the woods fringing the camp perimeter. 
JAMIE: Can we not rest a while? 
PENLEY: I think so, but a couple of minutes, no more. 
JAMIE: Aye, you're right. The Doctor needs help right away. 
PENLEY: I wasn't thinking only of the Doctor. 
JAMIE: Wolves. 
PENLEY: Yes. Here we're more or less safe, but the last stretch is open country. 
JAMIE: I don't help much, do I? 
PENLEY: Well, I'm not exactly a man of action myself. Storr should be here now. I miss him. 
JAMIE: Have you no weapons? 
PENLEY: Arden's tranquilliser gun, that's all. 
JAMIE: Aye, it's not much. 
PENLEY: Storr was a huntsman. An expert with a bow and arrow. 
JAMIE: It's no good wishing. 
PENLEY: Well, I'd better carry on. 
JAMIE: Aye, lead on McDuff. 
(A bear comes through the trees.) 
PENLEY: Keep very still.

[Spacecraft]

VARGA: So you are afraid of us. 
DOCTOR: No, but of your ship. If the ioniser sets off a nuclear holocaust, it will all have be in vain. 
VARGA: That is good. In that case you dare not act. 
ZONDAL: But if you thought there would be no explosion? 
VARGA: Well? 
DOCTOR: Well, in that case we'd have no choice. 
VARGA: You would use the ioniser. 
DOCTOR: But it wouldn't harm the ship. It would release it. 
ZONDAL: There would be floods. 
VARGA: Our engines would be useless. 
ZONDAL: We would be at your mercy. 
VARGA: Why did you come here? 
ZONDAL: To spy? To betray us? 
VARGA: But you could not hope to escape to tell the tale. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I always live in hope. 
VARGA: You have some kind of communicator. 
DOCTOR: You do realise, don't you, that after a certain point, my base will

[Ioniser control room]

DOCTOR [on monitor]: Have to activate the ioniser regardless of the consequences? 
VARGA [on monitor]: And destroy you and themselves as well?

[Spacecraft]

DOCTOR: Is that what would happen? 
VARGA: Give it to me. 
(The Doctor gives Varga the communicator.) 
VARGA: Ah, they would never know.

[Ioniser control room]

VARGA [on monitor]: They would never know. 
GARRETT: The Doctor. You heard what he said. 
CLENT: Regardless of the consequences. Yes. Yes, he's telling us to take the risk. 
GARRETT: But we can't give the computer the information it needs. It can't instruct us. 
CLENT: Can the ioniser hold? 
GARRETT: At present power it's steadily losing ground. But we dare not increase. 
COMPUTER: Summary of orders to all World Ioniser Stations. The new equation originated from Brittanicus Base will be adopted to conditions prevailing in each sector. All bases will prepare to use full ioniser attack on the ice in concerted action. Zero hour in six hours exactly. Report readiness one hour. 
CLENT: We can't do it. 
GARRETT: But if we don't the whole plan must fail. 
CLENT: But if we act and there is an explosion, apart from destroying this base the contamination could easily 
GARRETT: We must state our problem to World Control, now. 
CLENT: No, wait! We'll give our computer all the information we have. 
GARRETT: It isn't enough. 
CLENT: It may be. It may be. 
GARRETT: I know what the computer will say. 
CLENT: No, no, no, no, no. Let the computer speak for itself. 
GARRETT: There's only one answer it can give. 
CLENT: Come on, quickly. Put the situation to the computer. Do as you're told!

[Snowfield]

PENLEY: He's sizing us up. 
JAMIE: Can you not run for it? 
PENLEY: I don't intend to leave you here as hors d'oeuvre, laddie. 
JAMIE: Well, the gun. Use the gun. 
PENLEY: I couldn't hit the side of the mountain. I'm a scientist, not a gladiator. 
JAMIE: Well, at least you can try. 
PENLEY: All right. Well, cross your fingers. Here goes. 
(Penley fires and the bear comes towards them.) 
JAMIE: Quick, get me out of here. I'll tackle him. Get a hold of yourself, man. 
PENLEY: He's charging now! 
JAMIE: Quick, he's nearly on us! 
(The bear is just about on top of them when Penley fires again.)

[Ioniser control room]

COMPUTER: Set up all circuits to new equation and wait. Further information essential before decision can be taken. Prepare to notify World Control in event of emergency. 
CLENT: Of course, the computer's right. We must be prepared, and we must wait. 
GARRETT: It is the answer I expected. 
CLENT: But you don't realise why it made this choice, do you? 
GARRETT: Because it is the most logical answer in the circumstances. 
CLENT: Of course. And because it's so logical, it can't gamble. It can't take risks. 
GARRETT: That is its function. To be totally impartial. To serve the community. 
CLENT: Exactly. And one more aim in its life, to survive. 
GARRETT: It has given us its decision. 
CLENT: It is no decision. The computer is playing for time. Now listen, all of you! We risk destruction either by a radioactive explosion or by the slow grind of the glaciers. Now there you see that the ice has advanced one hundred metres today. Now either way 
GARRETT: The computer is destroyed. 
CLENT: So that, by demanding a decision, we are asking it to commit suicide. 
GARRETT: It can't do that! 
CLENT: Then what is the answer? 
GARRETT: We can escape. There's still time to evacuate. 
CLENT: Perhaps you could face world opinionata. I couldn't. 
GARRETT: You must notify World Control eventually. The other bases will be waiting. 
CLENT: I will decide exactly when. For now we do as the computer says. Prepare the ioniser and wait. Now, complete data check please, Miss Garrett. Miss Curtis, report to me the moment marker four reaches one five oh oh. One three seven nine, now. Well, what do you feel about all this, Walters? Bet you didn't think you'd have ice monsters and things like that to deal with when you volunteered for the job, did you? Well, did you? 
WALTERS: I didn't volunteer. 
CLENT: Ah, yes. Well, good man, anyway.

[Snowfield]

JAMIE: Penley! Penley, are you all right? 
PENLEY: If I can get out from under this brute I will be. 
JAMIE: You sure you're all right? 
PENLEY: Well he's clawed me, that's all. 
JAMIE: Now we'd better get away, quick. He won't be any friendlier when he wakes up.

[Spacecraft]

VARGA: Close engine room. Well? 
DOCTOR: It's an ion reactor, isn't it? Hmm. It could be dangerous, but it wouldn't necessarily explode. 
VARGA: True. But your friends do not know that. 
DOCTOR: Now why don't you let us help you? 
VARGA: We can get what we want without your help. 
DOCTOR: But what else do you need, apart from escaping from the ice? 
VARGA: We have had enough of your questions. Now you will give me answers. 
DOCTOR: Well, I've told you all I can about the ioniser. 
VARGA: That is only a toy. The base. What is its power source? 
DOCTOR: Why on earth do you want to know that? 
VARGA: Answer. 
DOCTOR: Oh, so that's what you need, is it? 
ZONDAL: Answer the Commander's questions. 
(Zondal has his gun at Victoria's head) 
DOCTOR: Fuel! Fuel for your reactor! And suppose I don't tell you? 
VARGA: The girl dies now. 
VICTORIA: Doctor, don't tell them. 
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll find what you need at the base. 
VICTORIA: You shouldn't have! 
DOCTOR: But you won't find Leader Clent easy to persuade. He's a very obstinate man. 
VARGA: He will listen to our sonic cannon. 
ZONDAL: We must act quickly, Commander. 
VARGA: Isbur and Rintan, wait for me at the entrance to the cave. Zondal, you will man the sonic gun. 
VICTORIA: You won't succeed. You can't be so inhuman. 
VARGA: We only fight to win.

[Ioniser control room]

GARRETT: Ion density reading at 1000. 2000. 3000. 4000. 5000. Operate. 
WALTERS [on monitor]: Reception check point to Leader Clent. 
CLENT: Yes, what is it? 
WALTERS [on monitor]: Two new arrivals, sir. 
CLENT: Well, I don't wish to be disturbed by trifles! 
WALTERS [on monitor]: These aren't scavengers, sir. It's the lad that came with the Doctor and Scientist Penley. 
CLENT: What? 
PENLEY [on monitor]: Clent, I must talk to you. I have news of the Doctor. 
CLENT: Walters! Bring the arrivals to me at once. 
WALTERS [on monitor]: Sir. 
GARRETT: Density compensator setting, please. 
COMPUTER: Density compensator setting, zero three nine seven seven seven zero one. Sequence ends. 
GARRETT: Take all systems up to this level. Everything seems to be proceeding satisfactorily. 
CLENT: Is it? 
GARRETT: What's wrong? 
CLENT: Penley's come back. 
GARRETT: Of his own choice? 
CLENT: Apparently. 
GARRETT: But why? 
CLENT: We shall soon see. If he tries to start any trouble 
GARRETT: Well, he can't be allowed to interfere with the programme. Not at this stage. 
CLENT: No. I no longer need to be tolerant with him because he's no longer my equal. He's an outsider. 
(Walters and Penley carry Jamie in.) 
WALTERS: Come on then. 
PENLEY: Put him over here. 
WALTERS: Take it easy. 
PENLEY: Rest on that, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Thank you. 
WALTERS: All right there, lad? 
JAMIE: Thank you. 
CLENT: No, stay, Walters. You may be needed. 
PENLEY: I'm not liable to be violent. 
(Penley hands over his little weapon.) 
CLENT: What do you want? 
PENLEY: Well, I brought this lad. He's in desperate need of medical supervision. 
GARRETT: We are not a first-aid centre. 
PENLEY: He's paralysed. 
CLENT: How did it happen? 
PENLEY: He was shot down by the warrior's guns. 
CLENT: Well, thank heaven their weapons don't deal fatal blows. 
PENLEY: Well they killed Arden. 
JAMIE: Look, you've got to help. 
CLENT: Yes of course, boy. Walters will take you to the Medi-Control Centre. 
JAMIE: No, I didn't mean me. I meant Victoria and the Doctor. Look, they're inside the alien spaceship. You've got to help them! 
CLENT: That isn't possible. 
JAMIE: Well it must be. You've got to do something. 
CLENT: No, we lost contact with the Doctor over an hour ago. I'm afraid there's no hope. 
PENLEY: You mean hope happens to be inconvenient. You've got to stick to your precious schedule, is that it? You've got to wave your splendid ioniser about to prove that it works and never mind about human beings. 
GARRETT: The computer has decided. 
PENLEY: The computer? Override it. Let the ioniser wait. The computer isn't going to fall apart because it has to mark time for an hour. 
CLENT: We are marking time. We're not using the ioniser under instructions from the computer itself. 
PENLEY: Why? 
GARRETT: The spaceship may contain a reactor system that could wipe us off this island if we cause it to explode. 
PENLEY: So what are you going to do? 
CLENT: We obey the computer. We will wait. 
PENLEY: Wait? But that's suicide. The glacier's practically on top of us. 
CLENT: We still have time in hand. 
JAMIE: Yes, but if the Doctor, if he's still 
CLENT: No. 
PENLEY: If the Doctor doesn't contact you, then what hope is there? 
CLENT: There is hope. 
PENLEY: Oh don't be a fool, Clent. You're not a man, you're just a machine slave. 
CLENT: Don't you spit your stupid liberty in my face, Penley. We know your kind of freedom. Freedom to run away from responsibilities, from service, from moral judgement. I may be a physical coward, Penley, but you're a coward in the mind. 
PENLEY: Well at least I have a mind and not a transistorised junction box. I would act, but you daren't. And so you're going to be destroyed along with your mechanical master. 
JAMIE: Look, you've got to help us, man. 
PENLEY: Jamie, I don't think you're 
(Jamie takes hold of Clent's arm. Clent starts shouting and Walters enters and shoots Penley and Jamie.) 
CLENT: There! Now, get them out of here! 
GARRETT: You'd better take them to the Medi-Control Centre. Get someone to look at the boy. Make sure there's a guard for when they come to. 
WALTERS: Right. Send two guards to control. 
CLENT: Penley. He's nothing. 
GARRETT: Our trust is in the great computer. With its aid, we cannot fail.

[Spacecraft]

VARGA [on monitor]: I am now outside their base. Stand by, gun control. Take target readings. 
(The sonic gun protrudes from the ship's hull again.) 
ZONDAL: Ready. Vertical bearing minus point nine. Lateral bearing three five. 
(The cross hairs are now in the centre of the dome.) 
ZONDAL: Prepare to charge to frequency three five. 
WARRIOR [OC]: Frequency three five. 
(The Doctor gestures Victoria to cry.) 
DOCTOR: It's all right Victoria, don't cry. It's all right. There's nothing to be afraid of. 
ZONDAL: Wait until Varga returns triumphant. Then you will have cause to cry. 
DOCTOR: Come along, Victoria, blow. Blow. 
(The Doctor makes the nose-blowing sound.) 
DOCTOR: That's better, that's better. (sotto) We can try and escape with this. 
VICTORIA: (sotto) What is it? 
DOCTOR: (sotto) Ammonium sulphide. 
VICTORIA: (sotto) Ammonium sulphide? It's only a stink bomb. 
DOCTOR: (sotto) Yes, you've had the benefits of a classical education. Yes, it is what you'd call a stink bomb. 
VICTORIA: (sotto) What use is that? 
DOCTOR: (sotto) You'd be surprised. Harmless to humans, but to aliens very possibly deadly! 
ZONDAL: The gun is fully ready, Commander. 
VARGA [on monitor]: Good, Zondal. We will now contact the scientists. On my command you will fire once. Do you understand? 
ZONDAL: Yes, Commander. 
VARGA [on monitor]: Good. 
VICTORIA: Zondal. Zondal, look! 
ZONDAL: What is it? 
VICTORIA: Look! 
ZONDAL: Do not try any tricks. 
(Victoria points to the bottom of the airlock door as the Doctor sneaks up behind Zondal.) 
VICTORIA: There's, there's water, seeping into the ship. Just there. 
DOCTOR: I can't get it undone. 
VICTORIA: Look, over in the corner there. 
(Victoria goes to help the Doctor.) 
VICTORIA: Let me. 
ZONDAL: You tricked me. There is no water. What is that? Let me have it. Give it to me at once. 
VARGA [on monitor]: Zondal. 
(Victoria throws the ammonium sulphate into Zondal's face.) 
VARGA [on monitor]: Zondal, fire. Fire now. Zondal, fire. Zondal fire. Fire now. 
(Zondal tries to reach the firing switch as he collapses. The Doctor struggles to keep his hand away from it.)

Episode Six

[Ioniser control room]

GARRETT: Co-ordinates for area red one. Oh oh eight one nine three vertical, eight five eight one eight oh lateral. Parallel lateral shift. Controls are set. 
CLENT: (unintelligible under the rising sound of the ioniser.) 
(The chandelier drops part way and ceiling plaster falls.) 
WALTERS: The records wing! It's gone! It's demolished! 
CLENT: We're under attack! Report! 
VARGA [on monitor]: Leader Clent, surrender or die! 
CLENT: What in the blazes? 
VARGA [on monitor]; Surrender now or I will blast your base to fragments. 
CLENT: No, I refuse! You can't destroy us! 
VARGA [on monitor]: You do not believe me? Very well. Must I fire again? 
GARRETT: We must play for time. 
WALTERS: The building won't stand much more of this bombardment, sir. 
CLENT: Then we must talk. Who am I addressing? 
VARGA [on monitor]: My name is Varga. Do you surrender? 
CLENT: Now frankly, you'll gain nothing by destroying us, Varga. We both have urgent needs. I will agree to talk but nothing more. 
VARGA [on monitor]: No treachery. If I come in peace there must be trust between us. 
CLENT: Very well. There will be no traps, or conditions. 
VARGA [on monitor]: See that you keep to that, for if you lie. 
(Transmission ends.) 
GARRETT: What does he want? 
WALTERS: Our guards won't stand a chance against weapons like that, sir. 
CLENT: You heard what he said. No treachery, only trust. 
GARRETT: But can we trust him? 
CLENT: I'm afraid we have to. He's got the best argument on his side. That gun, or whatever it is. 
GARRETT: We can bluff him though. 
CLENT: How? 
GARRETT: He doesn't know the computer's command to wait. We can threaten to destroy the glacier and his ship with it. 
CLENT: Yes, yes. Yes possibly. 
WALTERS: Well why can't we do it, sir? It's our only chance for survival. 
GARRETT: You know the computers decision and its reasons. 
WALTERS: I know all about that. But it doesn't exactly give much thought to us, does it? 
GARRETT: The computer thinks of everything, considers all the facts. 
WALTERS: And it's supposed to come up with all the answers, isn't it? Well, a fat lot of good it's doing us now. Wait, it says, wait! With glaciers on the one hand, and warriors on the other! Well, what price your computer now. 
CLENT: Walters! 
WALTERS: What we need is someone like Penley, or that Doctor. Somebody who can think. Not with a machine. And what good's your precious computer done anyway? Nothing! Nothing but trouble! And it's time somebody put a stop to it. 
(Walters raises his arms to smash a panel with a piece of debris, and Garrett shoots him.)

[Spacecraft]

VICTORIA: That's Varga's voice. 
DOCTOR: Shush. 
VARGA [on monitor]: We are going in now. 
VICTORIA: We must escape. 
DOCTOR: It's not just a question of escape, Victoria. We've got to take some action. It's this gun that's given Varga control of the base. Without it he'd be helpless. 
VICTORIA: What can we do? 
(The Doctor opens up a panel by the gun control.)

[Ioniser control room]

(Three ice warriors enter.) 
CLENT: Well now, gentlemen, you said no traps and we for our part have made utterly sure, that there are no traps 
VARGA: I made no promises. I merely warned you not to trick me. 
GARRETT: How can we help you? 
VARGA: I will tell you what I want and you will give it to me. 
CLENT: Oh, come now, Varga. That's not the way to talk. We're both of us in a very difficult situation and at times like this it beholds us both to proceed with mutual respect and, because the whole world could be 
(Walters has woken and is reaching for his weapon. An ice warrior kills him.) 
VARGA: So much for your word. 
CLENT: That was, that was not planned. 
VARGA: I have one major requirement. The mercury isotopes for my ships reactor. You will give them to me. 
CLENT: But we don't use mercury isotopes. 
VARGA: The Doctor stated that you had them here. 
CLENT: Well, he was wrong. We have none. 
VARGA: You are lying. 
CLENT: What good will it do me? 
VARGA: Tell me what will happen if we halted your reactor in order to remove the fuel elements we need. 
GARRETT: You can't do that! 
VARGA: Why? 
CLENT: That reactor gives us light, heat and power. 
GARRETT: And it powers the ioniser. 
VARGA: So that without it, you would be completely helpless. 
CLENT: In Arctic conditions like these we'd soon perish. 
VARGA: Whereas we would not. 
CLENT: You'd be wasting your time. This reactor does not use mercury. 
VARGA: I do not believe you. 
CLENT: But you must.

[Spacecraft]

VARGA [on monitor]: There is only one way to find out. Where are the reactor controls? Tell me now. 
VICTORIA: Did you hear that? Making them shut down the reactor. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Now this is Varga's main weapon. There's just a chance that I can turn it against him. 
VICTORIA: What? 
DOCTOR: If I can open these doors. There we are. Come on.

[Glacier cave]

DOCTOR: Now careful. Just stay there. How does this gun operate? 
VICTORIA: Oh, hurry, Doctor, hurry.

[Ioniser control room]

CLENT: You've got to believe me! 
VARGA: So you say. 
CLENT: Listen, Varga, the power source is locked in directly with the ioniser. Now if we cut the power before it is safe, the feedback effect could blast this building into a state of ion flux. 
VARGA: What's its temperature range? 
CLENT: It can melt rock. Don't interfere with it! It's fully primed. 
VARGA: It can melt rock. What a weapon. 
GARRETT: It is not a weapon. It is a scientific instrument. 
VARGA: I see it differently. 
CLENT: It's still a highly dangerous machine. 
VARGA: Then run is carefully down to safety level. But no tricks. You do it now. 
GARRETT: It will take some time. 
VARGA: Does it matter? You dare not use it anyway. 
CLENT: What? 
VARGA: Your Doctor friend talked. I know your fear of my spaceship. That it will explode if the heat is too great. 
CLENT: Would it? 
VARGA: Close it down or you die. 
CLENT: She's the only person qualified to disconnect the ioniser safely. 
VARGA: What are your qualifications for existence? 
CLENT: I'm the leader here. 
VARGA: You have less value to me than your colleague, who has certain skills. 
CLENT: But she doesn't know everything. I have the answers that you require. 
VARGA: I know all I need to know. If I killed you, it would be no great loss to me. 
GARRETT: No, please! 
VARGA: Then you will do as I say. Run down the machine as quickly as is safely possible. No more tricks. At once.

[Glacier cave]

(The Doctor has got into the gun's circuitry.) 
VICTORIA: What is it you're trying to do? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's a little difficult to explain, Victoria. Oh. Oh dear. Hold this for me, will you? This gun works on the basis that sound waves produce reverberations in the objects in their path. 
VICTORIA: The objects vibrate in sympathy. Well, I know. My father told me once. 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. Well if you can produce unsympathetic vibrations, damage results. 
VICTORIA: Damage? Oh, like a singer breaking glass. 
DOCTOR: Yes. But I want to be able to get at the warriors without it affecting the scientists too much. Now, if we change this to frequency seven. 
VICTORIA: What will that do? 
DOCTOR: Well, primarily it affects fluids. 
VICTORIA: What good is that to us? 
DOCTOR: Well, I believe that Varga and his warriors have a far greater fluid content than human beings. There. 
VICTORIA: If it works, what happens? 
DOCTOR: That's just it. I don't know. 
VICTORIA: Oh now look, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: But I do know that whatever effect it has on the scientists, it'll have a far greater one on the warriors.

[Spacecraft]

VICTORIA: Well, how's that? 
DOCTOR: Well, apart from the fluid question, their helmets will trap and intensify the soundwaves. 
VICTORIA: You mean, it'll knock them out and leave the scientists a bit dizzy. Well, is that it? 
DOCTOR: Well, that's what I'm hoping, but there is just a vague risk that it'll kill everybody. Clent and Penley included. 
VICTORIA: And Jamie?

[Medi-control centre]

(Jamie and Penley are lying on trolleys. Penley wakes and checks Jamie, then leaves. Jamie wakes.)

[Ioniser control room]

GARRETT: It's done. 
VARGA: It is safe now? 
GARRETT: Yes. Just ticking over. Not even holding the ice in check at all. 
VARGA: Disconnect it completely, now. Now we must move quickly, before the glacial surge does too much damage. 
CLENT: You'll regret this, Varga. 
VARGA: At least I will live to regret it. Now, the reactor. Shut it down, quickly. 
(Penley is watching through the open doorway. He crosses to the thermostat in the corridor.) 
PENLEY: Perfectly at home in ice age conditions. Well, we'll soon change all that. 
(Penley moves temperature to maximum, oxygen to minimum and humidity to maximum.) 
VARGA: Shut it down at once. The heat. What is happening? There is something wrong. 
(A heat haze rises.) 
VARGA: You are trying to trick me again. For that you will die.

[Spacecraft]

VICTORIA: No, no, no. It's too dangerous! 
DOCTOR: It's a risk we must take, Victoria! 
VICTORIA: Oh! 
DOCTOR: Now, cross your fingers. Here we go.

[Ioniser control room]

(The sonic gun is fired, and everyone clutches their head in pain. Clent screams. The ice warriors beat at their helmets as the humans pass out.)

[Spacecraft]

DOCTOR: Varga, this is the Doctor. Are you going to retreat, or shall I fire again? The trouble is I dare not use it again. If it hasn't killed them all already, another firing most certainly will. Varga! Answer me or I fire again!

[Outside the Ioniser control room]

(The ice warriors stagger out.) 
VARGA: You will die for this.

[Spacecraft]

VICTORIA: What are you doing now? 
DOCTOR: Get well back, Victoria. 
VICTORIA: What? 
DOCTOR: Stand by for fireworks. Here we go. 
(The Doctor touches two wires together and the sonic gun control panel explodes.) 
DOCTOR: Now, quickly. Let's get out of here before they come back. (Later, while all the humans are still out cold, Zondal wakes.) 
VARGA: The gun is useless.

[Outside the Ioniser control room]

DOCTOR: Victoria, see if you can find Jamie. 
VICTORIA: Doctor, Jamie's in there. He's alive! 
DOCTOR: Oh thank goodness for that. Now you get back to the Tardis, and close the doors. 
(The Doctor waves the remains of the ammonium sulphate under Penley's nose. It wakes him.) 
DOCTOR: Sorry about that. Up you get. Come along. 
PENLEY: What happened? Did you do that? 
DOCTOR: No time for questions. Come along.

[Spacecraft]

VARGA: So, you allowed them to trick you. 
ZONDAL: I await your punishment, Commander. 
VARGA: We have no time. Everything depends on being ready to break free from the ice as soon as they evaporate it.

[Ioniser control room]

DOCTOR: Up you get. Come along, Miss Garrett. There you are. 
GARRETT: Oh, the ioniser. They made me disconnect it. 
DOCTOR: Then it must be switched on again immediately. 
GARRETT: I don't take orders from you. 
CLENT: Miss Garrett, if we are to obey Computer Control, it must be reconnected. Do so, please. 
GARRETT: Yes, of course. 
DOCTOR: Clent, their spacecraft is powered by an ion reactor. 
CLENT: Well, that means we dare not use the ioniser at full force. That's our last chance gone. 
PENLEY: Why, for heavens sake? 
CLENT: Because of the risk, man. You know what would happen. 
DOCTOR: Of course there's a risk, but it's a risk we must take. It's the only way! 
PENLEY: Exactly. 
CLENT: The computer says no! 
PENLEY: The computer 
CLENT: Is our supreme advisor. 
PENLEY: And what sort of advice is that. Do nothing? 
GARRETT: We must obey! 
PENLEY: And be destroyed? Has the computer considered that? 
CLENT: The computer considers everything. 
DOCTOR: But that's why in this case you cannot rely on its judgement! 
GARRETT: We trust the computer. It is our strength and our guide. 
DOCTOR: Not this time. 
JAMIE: Well, why not? 
DOCTOR: Because Jamie, the computer is faced with an insoluble problem. Either way it risks destroying itself and this it cannot do. It must play safe. 
JAMIE: Aye, but if it does nothing that's just as bad. 
DOCTOR: I'll explain to you another time, Jamie. 
PENLEY: There's only one way out. 
CLENT: What? 
PENLEY: We must over-ride the computer. 
GARRETT: You can't do that! 
PENLEY: We must. This is a decision for a man to take, not a machine. The computer isn't designed to take risks, but that is the essence of man's progress. We must decide. 
CLENT: But if you do that you'll soon ruin the world plan. All the ioniser bases must act together through World Computer Control! If we act too soon it's as bad as being too late! 
PENLEY: Yes, I know that, but the other bases haven't got a glacier right on top of them and apart from that what about these ice warriors? If they live they threaten our entire civilisation. 
DOCTOR: A decision must be taken, and quickly! 
CLENT: I can't. 
GARRETT: I daren't. 
DOCTOR: Penley, it's up to you. 
PENLEY: Well, Clent? 
CLENT: I reserve the right to consult the computer. 
PENLEY: Go ahead. 
CLENT: Problem. Alien spacecraft is powered by an ion reactor. Dare we use the ioniser? What are the alternatives? Answer. 
(The computer spins and gibbers.) 
JAMIE: It's as though it's gone mad! 
DOCTOR: Well, Penley? 
PENLEY: We will use the ioniser at full strength to turn back the glacier. Miss Garrett, inform World Control. 
JAMIE: But the spaceship, if you release it from the ice? 
PENLEY: At full strength the ioniser will melt rock.

[Spaceship]

ZONDAL: Commander, the glacier is breaking up. Soon we will be free. 
VARGA: What use is our freedom if we are helpless? Our engines must still dead. 
ZONDAL: I have not given up yet. 
VARGA: Nor I. There must be some life left in the elements. 
ZONDAL: Commander, power. 
VARGA: What? The ice is our friend. We still have power. 
ZONDAL: Shall I increase it? 
VARGA: Carefully. We must time full take-off boost perfectly. 
ZONDAL: And when we are free and in flight, we will be invincible.

[Ioniser control room]

CLENT: Instrument readings on the glacier face show a steady rise in temperature. Now near to maximum. 
JAMIE: Well, do will we know? 
GARRETT: The instruments on the ice face have the highest heat and shock resistance known to man. When they cease to function, everything about them will be destroyed. 
CLENT: You're wrong! You're wrong! We'll all be killed! 
PENLEY: It is a risk I willingly take. 
(Penley slides the control down past generator, circuit lock, energy feed to activator)

[Spacecraft]

(The spacecraft is full of smoke.) 
VARGA: It was not power in the engines, Zondal, it was heat. Heat from the ioniser. 
(The instruments burst into flames.)

[Ioniser control room]

(The seismograph shows a small blip.) 
GARRETT: Only a minor explosion. We're safe! 
DOCTOR: Oh. Goodness me! 
PENLEY: Set all circuits to automatic, Miss Garrett, and tie in with the World Ioniser instrumentation. Clent, will you check these readings with me? And you've a report to prepare, haven't you? 
CLENT: Yes, yes, yes, I have. Penley, you are the most insufferably irritating and infuriating person I've ever been privileged to work with. 
PENLEY: Thank you. 
CLENT: Can't write a report though, can you? Something I've got to do for you. Well don't worry, it's something that I've been trained to do. 
PENLEY: Without the computer? 
CLENT: Now, Penley, I've always written my own speeches and my own reports. 
PENLEY: Are you going to include? Well, where's the Doctor? 
(We hear the sound of the Tardis dematerialising.)

Episode One

[Beach]

(The Tardis materialises on a golden beach.) 
JAMIE: Where are we, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: We're by the seaside, that's where we are. That's all that matters. 
JAMIE: Aye, but where? 
VICTORIA: Yes Doctor, we must know. 
DOCTOR: Oh, stop fussing, you two. Come on. 
(The Doctor goes for a paddle in the sea.) 
DOCTOR: Come on, you two. No, wait a minute. See if there's any buckets and spades in the Tardis. 
JAMIE: Buckets and spades? Is he going to dig for worms? 
VICTORIA: No, he wants us to play sand castles. 
JAMIE: Sand castles? What does he think we are, a couple of children? 
(The Doctor plays in the surf, then notices a hovercraft moored further along the shore and waves at it.)

[By the hovercraft]

(The man doesn't wave back. He and his young colleague are Australian.) 
ANTON: Hey, Rod, pass me those binoculars. 
ROD: Now what's biting you? 
ANTON: Some crazy nut dancing a jig. 
(He looks through the binoculars.) 
ANTON: Hey, wait a minute. It can't be. 
(Curly comes out of the hovercraft.) 
ANTON: Get below fast, both of you. 
ROD: What's the matter? 
ANTON: Move!

[Beach]

(The Doctor is down to his long-johns in the surf.) 
DOCTOR: Come on in, the water's lovely. You don't know what you're missing. 
VICTORIA: Doctor! You'll catch your death.

[Hovercraft]

ROD: Well, what do you know? You're right, it is him. 
ANTON: What are we going to do? 
(Anton picks up a handset and sets the dial.)

[Kent's office]

ASTRID: (blonde woman) Yes. 
ANTON [OC]: This is Anton. 
ASTRID: Where are you? 
ANTON [OC]: Ten miles west of Cape Harod. Now listen. 
ASTRID: Wait a minute. What are you doing there?

[Hovercraft]

ANTON: What do you think we're doing, fishing? 
ASTRID [OC]: I shouldn't be surprised. 
ANTON: Oh yeah? Well this time we've caught a whale. He's here!

[Kent's office]

ASTRID: Well, that's physically impossible. 
ANTON [OC]: It's him all right. There's no shadow of doubt about it. 
ASTRID: Oh no, you're making a mistake, you must be.

[Hovercraft]

ANTON: Now listen, there are three of us here. We've all had a look.

[Kent's office]

ASTRID: Well, if you're that definite I'll contact Giles. 
ANTON [OC]: No! We'll take care of this ourselves. 
ASTRID: Listen, Anton, you'll do nothing without Giles' agreement. 
ANTON [OC]: There isn't time!

[Hovercraft]

ASTRID [OC]: Make time. 
ANTON: If you think I'm going to pass up a chance like this, you're crazy.

[Kent's office]

ASTRID: Well, at least wait till I get there. 
(Transmission ends.) 
ASTRID: Anton! Anton! 
(But Anton is handing out guns.) 
ASTRID: Giles, that's just what I said. How could it be him? 
KENT [on monitor]: It's a mistake, it must be. 
(Played by the BBC's resident Australian, Bill Kerr.) 
ASTRID: Yes, I know, but he was definite. He's going to kill him. 
KENT [on monitor]: I don't care. Get after them, stop them! 
ASTRID: But Giles what can I do? 
KENT [on monitor]: Look, I don't care what you do, Astrid, but stop them!

[Beach]

(The Doctor has got dressed again.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, there's nothing like a dip to freshen you up. 
JAMIE: Hey, that's a funny looking boat. 
DOCTOR: It's not a boat, it's a hovercraft. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
DOCTOR: It's a hovercraft. It floats on the air instead of the sea. 
JAMIE: Oh, yes? Yeah, I'm too old for fairy tales. 
DOCTOR: No, it's true, Jamie. 
VICTORIA: What a terrifying thing. It's like a sea monster. 
JAMIE: Oh, we'll soon get a closer look. It's coming nearer. 
(The hovercraft is coming straight for them.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes. I don't think I like the look of this. Let's go. 
VICTORIA: Why, what's the matter? 
DOCTOR: Come on, run. 
JAMIE: But Doctor 
DOCTOR: Don't argue, run. Come on. Come on! 
(Curly aims at the travellers as they run for the sand dunes, and fires as the hovercraft moves onto the beach. The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria hide in the grassy dunes.) 
JAMIE: If only we had a gun. 
VICTORIA: But why would they want to harm us? 
DOCTOR: Why indeed? Well, what now? 
VICTORIA: Look, Doctor, can't we go back to the Tardis? 
DOCTOR: No, we'd never make it. There's not much cover here. 
VICTORIA: Perhaps we've landed in a world of mad men. 
DOCTOR: They're human beings, if that's what you mean, indulging their favourite past time. Trying to destroy each other. 
(The hovercraft stops and the men disembark with their guns.) 
DOCTOR: Time we went, come on. 
(The travellers sneak amongst the dunes. Anton sends Curly off to the right whilst he and Rod go left. The travellers meet up with Curly. Jamie knocks him out.) 
JAMIE: Creag an tuire! 
VICTORIA: Oh, well done. 
(Anton and Rod see a helicopter coming in to land.) 
JAMIE: What's that? 
ROD: I know those markings, that's Astrid's runabout. What's she doing here? 
ANTON: Interfering. We've got to get to him before she does. 
(The helicopter comes in to land close to the Doctor. Astrid is flying it.) 
JAMIE: What is it, Doctor? 
VICTORIA: Oh, I'm frightened! 
ASTRID: Over here! Run! 
VICTORIA: I can't! I can't! 
DOCTOR: You must, it's our only chance. 
ASTRID: Hurry! 
DOCTOR: Come on! 
(The three get aboard as Anton and Rod come into firing range.) 
ANTON: Leave it. 
(The helicopter takes off in a shower of bullets.)

[Helicopter]

DOCTOR: A very timely and welcome rescue. 
ASTRID: Don't speak to me for a moment, please. 
JAMIE: But what is this thing, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: It's a helicopter, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Huh? 
DOCTOR: A chopper. You know, a whirly bird. 
JAMIE: He say's it's a bird. 
DOCTOR: No, no, no. It's a primitive form of flying machine. 
VICTORIA: Well, at least we're safe now, aren't we? 
ASTRID: Depends on what you mean by been safe. They've shot a hole in the fuel tank. We might blow up any minute. 
(Anton and Rod half-carry Curly back to the hovercraft, then they head back onto the water and follow the helicopter as far as they can. Later, Astrid flies them inland to a lone bungalow.) 
ASTRID: Here we go.

[Outside the bungalow]

DOCTOR: Wait. You're hurt. 
ASTRID: It's nothing. We're lucky to be still alive. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, give her a hand.

[Astrid's living room]

DOCTOR: Come along inside. 
ASTRID: I'm all right. 
DOCTOR: Now let's have a look at it. You're not, and please don't argue. Victoria? Bring some warm water will you. 
VICTORIA: Well, where's the kitchen? 
ASTRID: Through the arch. There's a medical kit in the bathroom, through there. 
DOCTOR: Go and fetch it, will you, Jamie? 
JAMIE: Right. 
DOCTOR: Come and sit down. 
ASTRID: It's nothing. It's just a scratch. 
DOCTOR: We'll see. Oh, yes. 
(Astrid has a bad wound on her arm.) 
ASTRID: Who are you? 
DOCTOR: You mean you don't know? 
ASTRID: No, why should I? 
DOCTOR: Well you went to such a great deal of trouble to save us. Ah, there we are. Thank you, Jamie. 
ASTRID: Do you know how to use those things? 
JAMIE: Oh, don't worry, the Doctor will fix you up just fine. 
VICTORIA [OC]: Jamie! 
ASTRID: Oh, you're a Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well, not of any medical significance. 
ASTRID: Doctor of law? Philosophy? 
DOCTOR: Which law? Whose philosophies, eh? 
ASTRID: Oh, I see. You're determined to be mysterious. 
DOCTOR: Am I? 
ASTRID: Doctor of science? 
DOCTOR: Septic spray. That should be right. 
ASTRID: A Doctor of divinity, then? 
DOCTOR: You'll run out of Doctors in a minute. Now, you haven't told us your name yet. 
ASTRID: Astrid Ferrier. 
DOCTOR: Ah, Miss Ferrier, this is Victoria and this is Jamie. 
JAMIE: Hello. 
DOCTOR: Now, this won't take a minute. I just want to clean it off. Be as gentle as I can. There we are. Who are these men? Why are they so determined to kill us? 
ASTRID: Kill you. They hate you. 
DOCTOR: Me? I'm the nicest possible person. 
ASTRID: Or at least I should say they hate the person that they think you are. Passionately and completely. 
VICTORIA: Can't we tell them they've made a mistake? 
ASTRID: There wouldn't be time. 
DOCTOR: They seem remarkably dedicated. 
ASTRID: They are. 
DOCTOR: There. 
(The Doctor finishes dressing the wound.) 
DOCTOR: Tell me, Miss Ferrier, do you hate me? 
ASTRID: Far from it. To me you're the most wonderful and marvellous man that's ever dropped out of the skies. Will you do something for me? 
DOCTOR: Anything, anything at all. 
ASTRID: It'll probably cost you your life. Oh, but it would be worth it. 
DOCTOR: Oh, that's comforting, anyway. What is it that you want me to do? 
ASTRID: Let me take you to the man I work for, Giles Kent. He'll explain everything you want to know. 
DOCTOR: I don't think so, Miss Ferrier. No, I'm sorry. 
JAMIE: Can we not just listen, Doctor? There's no harm in that. 
DOCTOR: There's a great deal of harm in it. You don't suppose Miss Ferrier saved our skins for our sakes, do you? Now what is it you want us for? 
ASTRID: You resemble very closely a man who's determined to be dictator of the world. A man who will stop at nothing. 
VICTORIA: A dictator? Like Napoleon? 
DOCTOR: Who is he? 
ASTRID: Salamander. 
DOCTOR: Salamander? 
ASTRID: I know it's surprising. Let me take you to Giles Kent. 
(The hovercraft arrives outside.) 
VICTORIA: Oh, you're not going to agree? 
ASTRID: The back door! Hurry! 
DOCTOR: It's too late! 
ASTRID: In there! 
(They hide as Rod comes in through the back door. As he comes through the arch to the living room, Astrid grabs him and throws him against the wall.) 
ASTRID: Run for it! 
JAMIE: Come on! 
(Shots are fired through the window.) 
JAMIE: Miss Ferrier, come on. 
(Rod has been shot dead as Anton and Curly come in through the front.) 
CURLY: But I. He was framed against the window. I saw him, he was trying to get out! 
ANTON: No time now. They'll get away! 
CURLY: There they are! 
(Curly fires through the window.) 
ANTON: Wait! If we can get up in the air above them we can finish this. Now let's get to that helicopter!

[Outside the bungalow]

(The Doctor, Astrid, Victoria and Jamie hide in a ditch, and watch Anton and Curly run to the helipad.) 
ASTRID: The helicopter.
(It takes off, leaking fuel.) 
ASTRID: It'll blow up! (And so it does.)

[Kent's office]

KENT: Incredible. Absolutely incredible. 
DOCTOR: I'm not a specimen in a glass bowl, you know. 
KENT: I'm sorry. Do sit down. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. 
KENT: It's just so astonishing. You are Salamander. 
ASTRID: You see what I mean? 
KENT: But surely you know how alike you are? After all, Salamander is a world figure. 
DOCTOR: Well, my friends and I, we've been out of touch of civilisation for a while. We're visitors, so to speak. On ice, shall we say. 
KENT: I see. Where shall I start? 
DOCTOR: At the beginning, please. We've been subjected to a number of attacks because I look like this Salamander of yours. 
KENT: I'm not surprised. I'll show you why. I have a video wire of Salamander addressing the United Zones Conference on World Food. 
REPORTER [on screen]: And meanwhile, over at the United Zones General Assembly, from all over the world delegates were flocking in, eager to hear the latest report from Leader Salamander. 
(A swarthy black-haired man stands at a dais. He speaks with a Mexican accent.) 
SALAMANDER [on screen]: The progress, Mister President, of the Sun Conservation establishment at Kanowa, in the Australasian Zone, is, I'm delighted to report, highly satisfactory. But we cannot yet guarantee good summer holidays for all. However, we have now in orbit the Mark Seven Sun Catcher, and already we have been able to concentrate the sun's rays into much needed areas. The great Canadian wheat plains are safe. And now, Mister President, Ukraine, the grain field of the planet. That unfortunate area between Bucava and Kirovograd devastated by the elements two short years ago. What have I to say to you about that? I can tell you that on both banks of the Dnieper river the corn is ripening in the sun! And ten-thousand robot harvesters are moving down to gather in fifty million tons of flour! 
VICTORIA: There's nothing there to say he's a bad man. 
DOCTOR: I quite agree, Victoria. He seems to be a public benefactor. Quite a speaker too and remarkably handsome, didn't you think so Jamie? 
KENT: He's one of the most popular men on the planet. Many people call him the shopkeeper of the world. The saviour, in fact, some of them. 
JAMIE: Well, what's he saved the world from? 
ASTRID: Starvation. Too many people, too little food. 
KENT: Until Salamander invented his Sun Store. But surely you've heard? You must know? 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, well of course, we've heard something. 
KENT: The Sun Store collects the rays from the sun and stores them in concentrated form. 
JAMIE: Oh, like the ioniser, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes, a rather different principle, I think, Jamie, but 
VICTORIA: Well, never mind how it works. What's it for? 
KENT: Salamander can force grow three, sometimes four, crops in one summer. 
JAMIE: Well, why do these men want to kill him? I mean, one minute you say he's saving the world, the next 
KENT: For his own ends. Step by step he's taking control of this planet. 
DOCTOR: You have proof of this? 
KENT: Some, yes. I was once a high official in the World Zone Authority. Deputy Security Leader for North Africa and Europe, but Salamander discredited and ruined me because he realised I was beginning to get suspicious. 
DOCTOR: But you could be making up stories about Salamander out of revenge. 
KENT: Yes, I suppose so. Then you can judge for yourself. You remember Michael Assevski? He was Controller of the Eastern European Zone. He was drowned at sea a mile from shore. 
(A series of pictures come up on the screen.) 
KENT: Hockingham, murdered. All of them were seen with Salamander, or a man known as his deputy, shortly before their deaths. 
ASTRID: All of them were replaced by men known to be in Salamander's power. 
DOCTOR: Known by who? 
KENT: By me, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Well, why don't you tell the authorities, the police or whatever? 
KENT: Because I'm discredited, don't you see? Because Salamander is so popular and also because the man that took my place, a man named Donald Bruce, has since risen to become overall Security Chief. 
DOCTOR: Surely there is someone you can take your story to? 
KENT: Oh, yes. Helvig believed me. So did Assevski. And they're dead. However there is one other man, a man named Alexander Denes, but none of them will do anything until it's too late. 
VICTORIA: I'm surprised. Well if Salamander is everything you say he is, then why hasn't he tried to 
KENT: Dispose of me? 
VICTORIA: Yes. 
KENT: Well, he has, but he's afraid. You see the testimony of a dead man still holds legal weight. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. Well, it seems we have a problem on our hands whether to believe Mister Kent or not. 
KENT: Well there is one way that you can find out for yourselves. 
DOCTOR: Oh, how? 
ASTRID: Impersonate Salamander. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I thought that's what we were leading up to. 
JAMIE: Well, I must admit, Doctor, you do look like him. 
VICTORIA: Exactly like him. 
DOCTOR: Yes, there's more to it than that. What about the voice? 
ASTRID: Well, it's nearly the same pitch. Only the accent 
DOCTOR: Only the accent? My dear young lady. Oh, dear. Now what was it he said. (tries an imitation) We still cannot guarantee good summer holidays for all. No. Guarantee. No, no. Guaran. Guarantee. You see, it's very difficult. Of course I always was interested in phonetics. Holidays. Summer. Summer. He must have come from Mexico. Quintana Roo or Yucatan I shouldn't wonder. 
KENT: That's incredible, Doctor. He was born at Merida, state capital of Yucatan. 
DOCTOR: Yes, there are other very strong influences though. Oh, I could do it in time. But what if I did? What then? 
KENT: You could walk into Salamander's research station at Kanowa. Find out how he's getting control of the separate World Zones and then bring out absolute proof. 
(The phone buzzes. Kent listens.) 
KENT: Yes. I see. How long did you say it would take you to master Salamander's accent? 
DOCTOR: I didn't. It would take three weeks, perhaps four. 
KENT: Well, while we've been talking the Security Chief I told you about, Donald Bruce, has since cordoned off this entire area. He's coming here himself, now! I'd say you've got about two minutes, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: But that's out of the question! 
KENT: You know what he'll do as soon as he sees you, a man who resembles Salamander so closely? 
VICTORIA: Oh, that's not fair! 
KENT: Will you please listen! You'll be under arrest for impersonation as soon as he sees you. I mean it. 
DOCTOR: But isn't there another way out of this? 
KENT: Only one, be Salamander. 
VICTORIA: But the clothes! 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
KENT: Yes, there are some in here. 
(Kent opens an inner office door.) 
KENT: A little less eccentric, but do the best you can. 
DOCTOR: I won't! I can't! 
KENT: Your friends, Doctor, do you want them to suffer? Because they will, you know. 
DOCTOR: No, no, wait a minute! Why is a man like Bruce coming here? 
KENT: Don't push me. There isn't time. 
DOCTOR: You sent for him, didn't you? You tipped him off! 
KENT: I couldn't miss an opportunity like this. Now please, come on. 
(Kent pushes the Doctor into the inner office.) 
ASTRID: Giles, for heaven's sake, what have you done? It's far too risky. 
(A security guard enters with a gun. A tall, heavy man walks past him.) 
BRUCE: Hello, Kent. Doing some recruiting, are you? A bit young for killers, aren't they? 
VICTORIA: What do you mean? 
KENT: All right, what do you mean by stepping in here like this? 
BRUCE: Anytime, Kent. I've got the right and you know it. Anytime I like. 
KENT: All right, what do you want? 
BRUCE: That's better. You're ex-security, you know the way it's got to go. We might as well be nice and civil about it, mightn't we? That bungalow in Cedar District. In your name, right? 
ASTRID: Why? 
BRUCE: Do I have to tell you? There's been an awful nasty mess out there. Someone has got himself shot in your living room. And who are you two? 
JAMIE: Jamie McCrimmon. 
BRUCE: And? 
JAMIE: Victoria Waterfield. 
BRUCE: What's the matter, can't you speak? 
VICTORIA: Don't shout at me. 
BRUCE: Oh, very good. The outraged public citizen. Do they know who I am? 
KENT: Yes, they do. 
BRUCE: A pity. I like to hear you say it. Now listen to this, all of you. One of your men was murdered in a bungalow rented to you. The remains of two others were found in what was left of a helicopter. You were in that bungalow at the time and there were three other people with you. Two youngsters and a man, right? Now, there was another man, wasn't there? So we'll deal with that first. Where is he? 
(The guard opens the inner office door. A man comes out in a black roll neck pullover, black hair combed to the side. Bruce's jaw hits the floor.) 
DOCTOR: (mexican) Why, hello, Bruce. What are you doing here, huh?

Episode Two

[Kent's office]

BRUCE: I was under the impression you were in the Central European Zone, Leader. 
DOCTOR: (mexican) That's what you were meant to believe. 
BRUCE: Why? 
DOCTOR: I do not care to be questioned by my own security! 
BRUCE: But that's just it. How can I possibly maintain security when you behave like this? I'm at least entitled to know your movements. 
DOCTOR: You have a policeman's mind, Bruce. 
BRUCE: That may be, but only a few days ago you questioned me about this man and his activities and we agreed that he was dangerous. Now I find you in his office. 
DOCTOR: Sometimes I like to deal with matters in my own way. 
BRUCE: They're not holding you here? 
DOCTOR: Holding me? 
BRUCE: Under some threat or other. 
DOCTOR: No one threatens Salamander! 
BRUCE: I still think I deserve an explanation, Leader. 
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, you shall have it. But not now. When I return from the Central European Zone. 
BRUCE: Very well. Now, what about the dead man found in your bungalow. He was one of your lot, wasn't he? ASTRID: Yes. He was trying to protect me. The other two wanted to kill me. 
BRUCE: Now why should they want to do that to a nice young girl like you? 
ASTRID: Well I 
KENT: Obviously they thought I was there. 
BRUCE: You? 
KENT: Yes, Bruce, just like you a lot of people don't like me. 
BRUCE: Don't get clever with me, Kent. I've a good mind to 
DOCTOR: I am prepared to accept his story. 
BRUCE: Well, I'm not. 
DOCTOR: That's interesting, but not important. I accept it, that's all that matters. 
BRUCE: It's beginning to look as if these people are working for you now. Is that right? 
DOCTOR: You still dare to question me! They have information. I shall get it. I will see you on my return. Now leave me. 
BRUCE: McCrimmon, you said? 
JAMIE: Aye. 
BRUCE: Well, you just watch your step, that's all. 
(Bruce and his guard leave.) 
JAMIE: I never said a word. 
DOCTOR: (normal) Must be the way you look, Jamie. 
VICTORIA: You were splendid, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
ASTRID: That was a dangerous game to play. 
KENT: It paid off. All right, are you with us? 
DOCTOR: I don't know where you stand, Mister Kent, but you and this Salamander are obviously on opposite sides. That at least is clear. But which side is good? Which side is bad? And why should I interfere? 
ASTRID: Well, you're the only man who can help save the world. 
VICTORIA: But isn't that what Salamander's trying to do? 
ASTRID: Don't you understand? Salamander 
DOCTOR: Just a moment. Jamie, you're unusually quiet. What do you think? 
JAMIE: Well to save the world, aye, well it sounds grand, but. Oh, we couldn't turn our back on a chance like this, Doctor. Well at least I know you wouldn't. 
VICTORIA: We don't know anything about these people. 
JAMIE: Astrid saved our lives. She was wounded because of it. 
VICTORIA: Oh, but Jamie, you don't think 
JAMIE: Look, she was 
KENT: Look, we're right about Salamander. It won't take you long to find out for yourselves. 
DOCTOR: How do you propose we do that? 
JAMIE: He'll be well guarded for a start. 
VICTORIA: We can hardly steal into his study and go through his papers. 
DOCTOR: That man, Bruce, said that he was in the Central European Zone. 
VICTORIA: It's a long way from Australia. 
ASTRID: It's only two hours by rocket. 
KENT: You could leave almost at once. 
DOCTOR: Well, what then? 
ASTRID: I've had a plan for infiltrating into Salamander's inner circle for some time. Well, I could adapt it for your two friends. 
KENT: I can arrange three travel warrants and visas. Everything you need. 
JAMIE: Just three? 
KENT: Well one for Astrid, one for you and 
VICTORIA: Victoria. 
KENT: Of course. 
DOCTOR: Oh that's very clever of you. How can you do that? I thought you said you had no official position? 
ASTRID: We have a contact there. 
DOCTOR: He must be a very important person. 
ASTRID: He is. Denes, Controller of the Zone. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. What about me? 
KENT: I think we better have a look at Salamander's research station at Kanowa. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, but from a safe distance, of course.

[Benik's office]

(The Kenowa Research Station is a cluster of low buildings inside a perimeter fence.) 
BENIK: What is all this? I'll just give you a couple of minutes. I have a meeting. 
BRUCE: This is important, Benik. 
BENIK: I hope so. Well? 
BRUCE: Salamander's left you in control of the research station? 
BENIK: Yes. 
BRUCE: Did he go on the rocket for the Central European Zone? 
BENIK: Yes. 
BRUCE: Did you see him go aboard? 
BENIK: Hasn't been an accident, has there? 
BRUCE: Did you see the rocket take off? 
BENIK: Do you mean did I stand there waving my handkerchief? Hardly I had too much to do. 
BRUCE: You're not a very funny man, Benik. Not to me. Now answer me! Did you actually see him leave? 
BENIK: What is all this? 
BRUCE: I've just driven straight here from having spoken to Salamander, not two hundred miles away. 
BENIK: That's impossible! 
BRUCE: I don't lie, even to someone like you. He was with Giles Kent. 
BENIK: But he hates Kent. 
BRUCE: Exactly. 
BENIK: Kent wasn't holding him by force, was he? 
BRUCE: No, I thought of that. Salamander was a wee bit odd, I admit. Not quite his usual self, but he was perfectly in control. All he had to do was bat an eyelid and I'd have knocked off everyone in sight. 
BENIK: Oh well, I don't understand it. 
BRUCE: Now Salamander suggested that he was on his way to the Central European Zone. Now you're in radio contact with him. I want you to talk to him, make sure that Kent hasn't got some hold over him that we don't know about. 
BENIK: He instructed me not to bother him until the conference was over. 
BRUCE: Well, I'm countermanding that instruction. 
BENIK: I'm telling you, Bruce, he won't answer. Not till the conference is over. It's too important. 
BRUCE: How long will it last? 
BENIK: How should I know? They last three hours usually. 
BRUCE: All right, that'll have to do. Let me have a report as soon as you've spoken to him. Is that clear? Is that clear? 
BENIK: Yes. 
(Bruce leave, slamming the door. Benik picks up a handset.) 
BENIK: I want a direct channel link to Leader Salamander, Ariel TLXKZ. Notify me as soon as he is able to accept transmission. That's all.

[Palace terrace]

(In the Central European Zone, Salamander is sitting at a table with two colleagues.) 
DENES: (East European) This is dreadful news, Salamander. I still can't believe it. 
FEDORIN: Terrible, terrible. 
SALAMANDER: I don't say it will happen. I say it can happen. Your Zone is in danger, Denes. Here, here and here. 
FEDORIN: We've had no trouble for years in those mountains. 
SALAMANDER: You don't imagine I make it up? 
FEDORIN: No, no, of course not. 
DENES: Those volcanoes have been dead since sixteenth century. Fedorin is right to doubt. 
(The intercom buzzes.) 
SALAMANDER: A volcano is a strange thing, my friend. I tell you the truth. It's like a man in the hot sun, sleeping, still, lifeless. Then boom! He wakes full of energy! I know volcanoes. 
DENES: Isn't there a possibility of a miscalculation for a few degrees. 
SALAMANDER: I'm never wrong. Every one of my predictions has been accurate. 
DENES: Yes. Your record is good. I don't deny that. 
SALAMANDER: You are too kind. Now will you listen to me! 
(The buzzing continues. A black African woman enters.) 
FARIAH: Leader, the communications 
SALAMANDER: I know! I know! I told you I was not to be disturbed. 
FARIAH: Yes, Leader. 
SALAMANDER: No, wait! No, wait Fariah, huh? You like some refreshment, perhaps? 
FEDORIN: Thank you. 
DENES: No, no, not for me. 
SALAMANDER: Oh, you're going so soon? 
DENES: I must consult my scientific advisors. 
SALAMANDER: You still don't believe me. 
DENES: I believe you sufficiently to want to have your information checked before I alarm my people unnecessarily. 
SALAMANDER: Your scientists won't help you. They don't know. They are amateurs. 
DENES: No, Salamander, they are not amateurs. They are very clever men dedicated to their work. But they are men, capable of human error like anybody else. 
SALAMANDER: Do what you wish. Captain! 
(A guard enters.) 
CAPTAIN: Sir! 
SALAMANDER: Controller Denes is leaving. 
CAPTAIN: Yes, sir. 
SALAMANDER: You will soon see that I am right. (to Fedorin) Oh, you will stay, huh? Have a drink. We have a great deal to talk about, you and I. Fariah, see to him. 
(Salamander follows Denes indoors.)

[Public Gardens]

(Jamie and Victoria are seated on a park bench. They have suitcases with them.) 
JAMIE: Are you sure this is the right one? 
VICTORIA: I'm not sure of anything after that rocket. But Astrid said it was the third bench on the south walk of the large gardens. Well, here it is, I counted. 
JAMIE: Here we are. 
(Astrid arrives.) 
ASTRID: It's all arranged. Salamander's in residence in the President's Palace. 
JAMIE: What's the card? 
ASTRID: That'll get you through the front gate. Find the terrace facing west. 
VICTORIA: Good luck, Jamie. 
ASTRID: Yes, keep your wits about you. 
JAMIE: Right. 
(Jamie leaves. Astrid takes out a communicator.) 
ASTRID: Hello. Hello! Australasian Zone? How much longer? Look, don't talk to me about sun spots. What? Well, the Central European Zone. Please don't worry about procedure. This is urgent. Connect me!

[Kent's office]

KENT: That might be her now. Yes. 
ASTRID [OC]: Hello, Giles? This is me, Astrid. 
KENT: Right, let's have it. What's happening? 
ASTRID [OC]: Everything's gone fine so far. 
KENT: Speak up. We can't hear you very well.

[Public gardens]

ASTRID: Oh, it's these spots.

[Kent's office]

KENT: Oh, she's having spot trouble. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes. 
KENT: Right, how is the plan working so far? 
[Public gardens]

ASTRID: It's gone fine. The rocket arrived right on time in Hungary, and Jamie's got his entrance pass and has started phase one. 
KENT [OC]: Do you think the boy can handle it? 
ASTRID: Well I hope so. My goodness, they're a pretty odd lot though, aren't they?

[Kent's office]

KENT: Well actually the Doctor's with me right now. 
ASTRID [OC]: Oh, I am sorry. Oh, I know I'm sure they'll be fine. 
KENT: What news of Denes? We must keep him posted as to what is happening.

[Public gardens]

ASTRID: It's all right. We've contacted and we've arranged to meet.

[Kent's office]

KENT: Be careful, he's pretty well known. 
ASTRID [OC]: Oh, don't worry. I suggested that we meet under a disused jetty by the river. 
DOCTOR: Disused Yeti? 
KENT: No, no, no, no. Jetty, jetty. Ah, anything else to tell us?

[Public gardens]

ASTRID: No. If the plan goes through I'll try and contact you again. 
KENT [OC]: Right. Goodbye, good luck.

[Kent's office]

DOCTOR: Good luck, Astrid. Jamie and Victoria will look after you. 
KENT: Astrid, are you there? We're. She's gone. And I'm not surprised after that last remark. 
DOCTOR: Well, I'm sorry.

[Palace terrace]

(Fariah pours a drink for Fedorin.) 
FEDORIN: Why don't you sit down? 
FARIAH: No! 
FEDORIN: Why not? 
FARIAH: I have never sat out here. 
FEDORIN: Salamander won't mind. 
FARIAH: I would never sit down here. 
FEDORIN: If you don't like him why do you work for him? 
FARIAH: He has a way of persuading people. 
FEDORIN: Yes, I can imagine that. 
FARIAH: Brehau. 
FEDORIN: What? If only I knew what he wanted to talk to me about. Would you know? 
FARIAH: Salamander talks to many people. Some only once. 
FEDORIN: Well, I shall know soon enough, I suppose. What exactly do you do here? 
FARIAH: I serve. 
FEDORIN: Yes, but you're obviously not an ordinary servant. 
FARIAH: No, I'm not. 
FEDORIN: What then? 
FARIAH: Would you like some more refreshment? 
FEDORIN: No, I'll get it myself. 
(Fedorin pours another drink.) 
FEDORIN: Oh, that's good. 
FARIAH: Is it? I'm very glad to hear that. 
FEDORIN: What? 
FARIAH: I am Salamander's food taster. 
FEDORIN: Does he need one? 
FARIAH: There have been many attempts to poison him. 
FEDORIN: Dangerous job. 
FARIAH: That's why it's very nice to have help for a change. 
FEDORIN: You mean? You mean you haven't? 
FARIAH: No. I didn't have time. Still taste good? Nothing bitter? 
FEDORIN: No. I, I don't think so. 
FARIAH: You would know by now, I think. 
FEDORIN: Oh. Oh, you, you had me worried for a moment. But what on earth made you take a job as a food taster? 
SALAMANDER: She was hungry. Only thing is, now she has all the food she needs, she's lost her appetite. Give me a drink. 
FEDORIN: You are well protected. 
(Salamander clicks his fingers and a guard enters, pointing his gun at Fedorin.) 
SALAMANDER: Very well protected. Be calm. Sit down. Drink your drink. 
(A figure jumps down onto the terrace from a high wall, knocks out the guard and takes his gun.) 
JAMIE: Thank you for calling the guard. I was wondering what to do about him. Now don't move for that box! Not if you value your life. Now all of you, back over there! That's it. 
(Jamie takes the intercom and throws it over the wall.) 
JAMIE: Not as well protected as you think you are, hey? Now when I say duck. 
(Jamie throws the intercom over the side of the terrace.) 
JAMIE: Duck! Get down! (Astrid triggers a detonator and there is an explosion. As Salamander gets to his feet, Jamie puts the gun on the table. Two guards rush in to shoot Jamie.) 
SALAMANDER: Halt! What do you do, boys, huh? Read? Sleep? It's a fine thing. Here we have an attempt to destroy me and where are you? It's not so good, boys. It's not so good. I'm watching you. Look after him. 
(The guards carry their colleague away.) 
SALAMANDER: Better still, get rid of him. What's all this about, huh? 
JAMIE: I heard two men talking. They said they'd planted a bomb of some kind in your radio telephone. I tried to warn them at the gates, but they wouldn't pay any attention. 
SALAMANDER: So you break in? How you break in? 
JAMIE: Ah well, I'm here on holiday with a friend. She's very pretty, so the guard didn't see me slip past him. 
SALAMANDER: Why didn't you call out and warn me? I nearly used the radio telephone several times. 
JAMIE: Ah you'd have had me shot, most like. 
SALAMANDER: Why you risk your skin to save me? 
JAMIE: Well, without you the Earth hasn't much of a chance, has it? 
SALAMANDER: You like to work for me, huh? You like that? 
JAMIE: Oh no, you don't have to do that. I mean, you owe me nothing. 
SALAMANDER: You're quite right, boy. 
JAMIE: And I'm on holiday. 
SALAMANDER: You won't find what I pay you disappointing. 
JAMIE: Aye, there's my girlfriend too though. 
SALAMANDER: Oh we might be able to find something for her, hey Fariah? 
FARIAH: Yes. Your chef could use an assistant. 
SALAMANDER: See to it. What do you say, huh? 
JAMIE: Well, I'll give it a go. But I'll say this though. Your security system's rotten. There'll have to be changes. 
SALAMANDER: What a boy, huh? Fariah, see he gets some proper uniform instead of this skirt. And bring him and his girlfriend to see me. 
FARIAH: Come along then. 
(Jamie and Fariah leave.) 
FEDORIN: What an extraordinary young man. 
SALAMANDER: I prize loyalty very highly, my friend, and I repay it very generously like I do the girl Fariah, huh? 
FEDORIN: Can I... Can I ask you something? 
SALAMANDER: What is it? 
FEDORIN: What does Brehau mean? 
SALAMANDER: It's a word we use in Mexico for sorcerer. Why? 
FEDORIN: Nothing, nothing. 
SALAMANDER: You stay for dinner, huh?

[Public gardens]

(Victoria is sitting on the bench, while Astrid sits at the other reading a book.) 
ASTRID: Here comes Jamie. 
JAMIE: Everything's fine. 
VICTORIA: Oh good. 
ASTRID: Careful, you might have been followed. 
JAMIE: Oh don't worry, they think I've saved his life. Hey he's offered me a job. To you as well. 
VICTORIA: That's perfect. 
ASTRID: Well done, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Well it was nothing. Is it all right your end? 
ASTRID: Yes. But it was nothing. 
VICTORIA: Jamie. Jamie! 
JAMIE: What? 
VICTORIA: Does he look like the Doctor? 
JAMIE: Aye, it's so uncanny. 
ASTRID: Careful. 
JAMIE: What's the matter? 
VICTORIA: What is it? 
(Astrid leaves. Fariah approaches with the guard captain.) 
JAMIE: She must have eyes in the back of her head. So he's offered the both of us a job. 
VICTORIA: Oh, good. 
CAPTAIN: Who was that? 
JAMIE: Who? 
CAPTAIN: The other girl who was sitting there? 
FARIAH: Why don't you leave them alone? Do you have to treat everyone as if they're criminals? 
CAPTAIN: He had no right to leave the Presidential Palace. 
FARIAH: He had every right. He came to fetch his girlfriend. Salamander ordered it. 
CAPTAIN: I didn't hear Salamander order it. 
FARIAH: Very well, go and ask him. No? Perhaps you're wise. 
(The Captain leaves.) 
FARIAH: He would follow me. I am Fariah. How do you do? 
JAMIE: This is Victoria. 
VICTORIA: Hello. 
FARIAH: Hello. Jamie tells me you're studying the arts of the kitchen. 
JAMIE: Aye, she's a great dishwasher. 
VICTORIA: I like eating, and I'm hungry. 
FARIAH: Then let's see if we can't find you something to do. You can work with me if you like. 
VICTORIA: Thank you.

[Disused jetty]

(Astrid checks that she's not being watched then goes underneath the structure. Someone crawls towards her and she takes out her gun.) 
DENES: I used to love to do this sort of thing when I was a boy. 
ASTRID: I'm sorry. It was the safest place I could think of. 
DENES: Oh, it's all right. I'm still fit enough. 
ASTRID: Thank you for getting me the necessary documents. 
DENES: Have you been successful? 
ASTRID: So far. Salamander's swallowed it. 
DENES: I thought he would. 
ASTRID: The boy's very confident. The girl, not so much. 
DENES: See the point is that I'm near enough to him to pick out something. This was the first time I met Salamander. I must say that you were right about him, Astrid. We must get rid of him. He must be stopped. 
ASTRID: He will be stopped. I'm returning to Giles Kent. Can you wait til we can take action? 
DENES: Oh, with a bit of luck, yes. 
ASTRID: Fedorin. Can you trust him? 
(There are footsteps overhead.) 
ASTRID: Oh, I've been followed. I thought I'd thrown them off. 
DENES: No! There is enough violence as it is. Besides, Salamander mustn't get suspicious. You kill his men and he will begin to think. 
(More footsteps join the first set.) 
GUARD [OC]: You understand that strangers are to be picked up. There's been an attempt on Salamander's life. Very well, return to your patrol. 
ASTRID: It's all right. Fedorin, would he betray you in some way? 
DENES: I'm trying to think of some reason why he should.

[Palace terrace]

(Night is falling. Fedorin is reading a dossier.) 
FEDORIN: But these are all lies, Salamander. Lies, I assure you. 
SALAMANDER: So you say. 
FEDORIN: What are you going to do? My family, my friends. 
SALAMANDER: My dear man. My dear Fedorin. You don't suppose I intend to make your swindling public, huh? This is, this just an insurance, hmm? Sit down, forget it. I tell you what I'm going to do for you.
FEDORIN: What? 
SALAMANDER: You are going to replace Denes as controller of this Zone. But, don't say anything. I'll know you'll accept. 
FEDORIN: What do you want? 
SALAMANDER: I tell you. There will be disaster in this Zone. I cannot stop the disaster, but I can come to the aid of this Zone when it's happened. 
FEDORIN: And take over? I see. The Zone would be yours. 
SALAMANDER: Oh, ours, Fedorin, ours. It's a partnership I'm offering you. Either you have half of everything, or you have nothing. 
FEDORIN: But there's Alexander Denes. 
SALAMANDER: Oh yes, the popular, well beloved Denes. What a pity. 
FEDORIN: Pity? 
SALAMANDER: Oh, didn't I tell you? Denes is going to die mysteriously. An assassin. Terrible. 
FEDORIN: I can't do that. You can't ask me! 
SALAMANDER: I think I can ask you to do anything I want. 
(The terrace trembles.) 
SALAMANDER: My predictions are accurate! 
(Salamander picks up a pair of binoculars.) 
SALAMANDER: The entire Eperjest Tokyar ranges are in eruption. Fedorin, come and look. It's very pretty. The history of Hungary is about to be rewritten. 
BRUCE: Salamander. 
SALAMANDER: What are you doing here, Bruce? 
BRUCE: I had a report there was trouble here. An attempt on your life. 
SALAMANDER: It was nothing. Come and look. 
(Bruce takes the binoculars.) 
BRUCE: Terrible. Those poor people. 
(Denes rushes in.) 
DENES: Salamander! What have you done? 
SALAMANDER: I warned you. 
DENES: You couldn't have known. You've done this somehow yourself! 
SALAMANDER: The man is mad! Worse still, he is incompetent! I warned this man that this Zone was in danger of natural disaster and he did nothing! Issued no cautions to the public. You deliberately allowed your people to suffer and die! You're a traitor! 
DENES: You're a traitor! You contrived this for your own ends. 
SALAMANDER: Bruce, I order you to arrest this man. 
DENES: But this is nonsense. Fedorin, you were here. You know this is nonsense. 
SALAMANDER: Denes, you are too naive. At your trial Fedorin will be the chief witness against you.

Episode Three

(From the Lost in Time DVD)

[Palace terrace]

(A guard in rubber suit and helmet stand either side of the man in the grey suit, Denes. Jamie is also in a guards uniform.) 
CAPTAIN: Prisoner's escort, halt! 
SALAMANDER: Bruce, you are head of World Security. I hold you personally responsible for this man Denes. 
BRUCE: Why? Don't you trust your own security? 
SALAMANDER: Do I have to insist? My name carries some weight in the councils of the world. 
BRUCE: Of course it does. 
SALAMANDER: Well, do as I ask. 
BRUCE: Very well. 
SALAMANDER: Fedorin, come with me. We must make a report to the World Authority. 
DENES: They won't believe a word you tell them. 
SALAMANDER: We shall see. Fedorin. 
(Salamander and Fedorin leave.) 
BRUCE: I'll do what I can for you, but I don't want any trouble. 
DENES: Don't worry. I'm looking forward to facing Salamander in public court. I won't run away.

[Salamander's office]

(Salamander turns the dial on a wall safe.) 
SALAMANDER: You've done very well so far, Fedorin. 
FEDORIN: It's nothing but a blackmail. 
SALAMANDER: Blackmail? What have I threatened you with? Nothing. 
FEDORIN: No. But you would if I refused to. 
SALAMANDER: Fedorin, I keep on telling you, this is just a form of comprehensive insurance, huh? It's nothing for you to worry about. Oh, my dear man, I've done nothing but praise you ever since we first met. I said you should be European Controller. I said I would support you. 
FEDORIN: You found out things about me, lies that would damage me. 
SALAMANDER: On the contrary, I'm doing you a good turn. I'm actually suppressing facts about you. 
FEDORIN: Lies, I tell you! 
SALAMANDER: Lies, truth, who knows. But we wouldn't like to put him to the test, would we, huh? 
(Salamander puts the dossier in the wall safe, then gives Fedorin a small case.) 
SALAMANDER: There. 
FEDORIN: What's this? 
SALAMANDER: Used in the right way, at the right time, it can dictate your own future, and the future of Alexander Denes. 
FEDORIN: Poison?

[Palace terrace]

BRUCE: I want you to take a message. McCrimmon. What are you doing dressed like this? 
JAMIE: Leader's orders. 
BRUCE: Well, as you're here, I've got some questions I want to ask you. 
JAMIE: I've better things to do, thank you. 
BRUCE: I want to know what Salamander and Giles Kent were discussing when I saw you last. 
JAMIE: It's not for me to tell you that. 
BRUCE: I'm concerned with Salamander's safety. Giles Kent is supposed to be his bitter enemy. 
JAMIE: Look, if Salamander wishes you to know that, I dare say he'll tell you himself. You'll get no confidences out of me.

[Palace corridor]

DENES: Well, how much longer am I to be kept here? You choose to be insolent? 
JANOS: We're waiting for the security hovercar. The volcanic eruptions have disrupted everything. 
(The Captain approaches.) 
DENES: You, Captain. Isn't there a room I could wait in? 
CAPTAIN: I'm simply obeying orders. 
DENES: Perhaps you might interpret your orders differently, huh? 
CAPTAIN: Mister Denes, what can I do? You are no longer the Controller. You're a prisoner here. 
BRUCE: Captain? Why is Mister Denes being kept in the corridor here? 
CAPTAIN: It's easier to guard him here. 
BRUCE: Are you all right? 
DENES: Yes, thank you. 
BRUCE: Something to read, perhaps? 
DENES: That would be a comfort, yes. 
BRUCE: The Controller is not to be treated as a convicted man before his trial. See he has whatever he wants. 
(Bruce leaves.) 
CAPTAIN: What can I get for you? 
DENES: Well, if we are to wait, something to eat and drink. 
CAPTAIN: Very well. 
JANOS: Prison rations, Captain? 
CAPTAIN: Certainly not. Nothing but the best for Controller Denes. From our Leader's own kitchens. 
JANOS: Sir. 
CAPTAIN: And to read? 
DENES: Well, something light. A book about foreign travels perhaps?

[Palace kitchen]

GRIFFIN: So you reckon you know about cooking? 
VICTORIA: Yes, I used to do lots at home. 
GRIFFIN: All right, give me a menu. 
VICTORIA: What, now? 
GRIFFIN: Yeah, now. 
VICTORIA: Soup. Fish. Meat and pudding. 
GRIFFIN: Dessert. 
VICTORIA: Yes. 
GRIFFIN: Go on. What else? 
VICTORIA: Oh. 
GRIFFIN: Yes, you're a bit too smart for me. All right then, let's have a recipe. 
VICTORIA: What, now? 
GRIFFIN: Yeah, now. 
VICTORIA: Oh, yes! Yes! We used to have a lovely pudding at home, with lots of almonds, eggs, lemon peel, candied peel, oranges, cream and, oh it was lovely! 
GRIFFIN: You wouldn't know how to make it? 
VICTORIA: Oh it's quite simple, really. You sort of whoosh it up all together. 
GRIFFIN: Well that sounds easy. What's this whoosh-up called, then? 
VICTORIA: Kaiser pudding. 
GRIFFIN: Oh that's great, just great. Yes, I've got a job for you, all right. Peel those spuds, yeah, now. 
FARIAH: Is that the best you can do for her? The girl must learn. 
GRIFFIN: Back at school, are we? Well, I suppose there are worse things. The place could be overrun with rats gnawing holes in the gas pipes so the ovens catch fire and burn the building down. 
FARIAH: It isn't that bad, Griff. 
GRIFFIN: Look, I'm only trying to help with the. See? There, you see? This chicken's browning too soon already. It'll be as tough as rubber. 
FARIAH: Oh, Griff. 
GRIFFIN: Now the soup's boiling. Did I put any salt in it? Dinner tonight's going to be national disaster. My mother was right. 
VICTORIA: What? 
GRIFFIN: She wanted me to be a dustman. Here, look, you want to do something useful? 
VICTORIA: Oh yes, please. 
GRIFFIN: Well sit down and write out the menus. First course interrupted by bomb explosion. Second course affected by earthquakes. Third course ruined by interference in the kitchen. I'm going out for a walk. It'll probably rain. 
(Griffin leaves.) 
VICTORIA: He doesn't like me. 
FARIAH: It isn't you. He's the same with everyone. 
VICTORIA: Even Salamander? 
FARIAH: Listen. You must go away from here. Don't get caught up in Salamander's world. 
VICTORIA: Why? What do you mean? It sounds as if you don't like him. 
FARIAH: Like him? I 
(Jamie enters.) 
JAMIE: Oh, hello there. 
FARIAH: Finish writing those menus. 
(Fariah leaves.) 
VICTORIA: Did you hear that? 
JAMIE: Aye. Work on her. I have a feeling she can tell us something about Salamander. 
VICTORIA: All right. As soon as I can. What have you been doing? 
JAMIE: I managed to slip out and tell Astrid everything that's happened. 
VICTORIA: Oh, you might have told me, Jamie. 
JAMIE: There wasn't time. She's trying to get Denes away. 
VICTORIA: And take him to the Doctor? He'd believe Denes. 
JAMIE: Aye, he would. 
VICTORIA: But how can she get in? Salamander's got guards everywhere. 
JAMIE: She's got friends here. They're going to arrange passes and the right sort of uniform. 
VICTORIA: What sort of uniform? 
JAMIE: Don't know. Messenger delivery or something. Shh!

[Outside the kitchen window]

GUARD: Controller Denes has been arrested. I can't make up my mind whether Fedorin is to be regarded as the new Controller or not. 
GUARD 2: The burden of office is heavy, my friend. I remember when I was

[Kitchen]

JAMIE: All right, they're gone. 
VICTORIA: Astrid and Giles Kent were quite right, Salamander is an evil man. I can somehow sense it from all the people here. 
JAMIE: Aye, he's bad all right. He's had Denes arrested, and he's got this man Fedorin eating out of his hand. 
VICTORIA: Why should he do that? 
JAMIE: Remove the honest man and put a weaker man in his place, but somehow have a hold on him. That way Salamander can take over the territory. 
VICTORIA: Oh, I see. And when everything's in a turmoil because of the earthquakes. 
JAMIE: Aye, and that's lucky to say the least. 
VICTORIA: But you don't really believe that Salamander could cause earthquakes, do you?

[Kent's trailer]

(Outside the Kenowa Research Station, they are watching the eruptions and lava flows on television.) 
KENT: I'm certain Salamander's causing the earthquakes, Doctor, and I'm sure your friends Jamie and Victoria will tell you just how bad he really is. 
DOCTOR: But why make earthquakes? 
KENT: Years ago, Doctor, when one country wanted to invade another it set about attacking the confidence of that country, throwing it into confusion, making it weak. Then it was right for takeover. Now isn't that exactly what's happening here only in a different way? 
DOCTOR: What you're saying is that Salamander's found a way of harnessing the natural forces of the earth. It's a little difficult to accept. I'm not saying it's impossible, mind you. You say it's coming from the research station. Salamander's research station, eh? 
(The Doctor looks at it through a pair of binoculars.) 
KENT: That's what I believe, in spite of. Shush! Wait a minute. 
(Kent looks outside.) 
KENT: In spite of a number of reasons. He invented the sunstore, a brilliant advance. He found a way of directing conserved energy to areas starved of sun. 
DOCTOR: What made you suspicious? 
KENT: All the money he was spending at the research station. The materials involved, the food stores. It didn't make sense. I had all the papers, all the requisition orders. 
DOCTOR: But that's valuable evidence! 
KENT: All destroyed, and new ones appeared, and I was made out to be the criminal. All by suggestion, of course. I was discredited. And every accusation I made against Salamander was put down as an attempt to throw suspicion off myself. 
DOCTOR: A sort of Jekyll and Hyde character, perhaps, our Mister Salamander. It'll be interesting to see what report Jamie brings back. 
(Vehicles with sirens are heard outside.) 
KENT: Security. Quick! Here. 
(Kent lifts the lid of a blanket box. The Doctor gets in.) 
DOCTOR: I hope there's plenty of air in here. 
KENT: Yes, yes, yes. 
(Kent goes to the sink just as Benik enters.) 
BENIK: So. It's you. I might have known. 
KENT: Do you have any authority? 
BENIK: You're on research station territory. 
KENT: Not quite. Have a look at the boundary lines. 
BENIK: That's very clever. Well, what are you doing here? 
KENT: I don't have to answer your questions. 
(Benik picks up the binoculars.) 
BENIK: Bird-watching, no doubt? 
KENT: Perhaps. 
BENIK: Yes, there's a perfect view of the research station from here. 
KENT: Really? 
(Benik takes a photograph off the wall.) 
BENIK: Well, well, well. A memento of the old days. 
(Benik smashes the photograph.) 
KENT: You have no right to 
BENIK: Guard! 
(A guard enters, weapon ready.) 
BENIK: It was just an accident. Now then, you won't be staying in this vicinity, will you. 
KENT: You can't make me leave here. 
(The guard goes to the sink and smashes the crockery.) 
KENT: Hey now, watch that! 
(Kent is pushed back, and the guard wreaks havoc on the cupboard contents too.) 
BENIK: All right. That's enough. 
(The guard leaves.) 
BENIK: Well, there's not much point in your staying here now, is there. Oh, I wouldn't complain to anyone about this if I were you, Kent. After all, nobody would believe you, would they? 
(Benik leaves. Kent helps the Doctor out of the blanket box.) 
KENT: Come on. Now do you believe the sort of people we're up against? 
DOCTOR: Unpleasant, yes, destructive, but not necessarily evil. 
KENT: Why won't you believe me? 
DOCTOR: It is too important. I must be sure. Oh dear. What pretty crockery this is. Sad really, isn't it? People spend all their time making nice things, and other people come along and break them. 
KENT: That's what I'm trying to tell you about Salamander. He's trying to destroy the world! 
DOCTOR: Facts, Kent. I must have facts. That's what I hope Jamie's going to bring back.

[Palace corridor]

JANOS: Halt! Why are you running? 
ASTRID: I have an urgent message for Leader Salamander. 
JANOS: Your pass? You have not been here before. 
ASTRID: No. 
JANOS: I thought so. Next time do not run. It is dangerous to run here. 
ASTRID: I'll remember. 
JANOS: Wait! You like wine? My name is Janos. We drink wine together tonight? 
ASTRID: I have to go and deliver my message. 
JANOS: Yes, but later you will come back? 
ASTRID: Oh yes. Yes, I'll come back. 
CAPTAIN: Just a moment! 
ASTRID: I have an urgent message for Leader Salamander. 
CAPTAIN: Yes, I heard you. Where is it? 
ASTRID: It's private and personal. 
CAPTAIN: I don't want to read it. Keep still. 
ASTRID: I have to deliver this to Salamander personally. 
CAPTAIN: You do have a message? 
ASTRID: Of course. 
CAPTAIN: Then show me. 
(Astrid hands over some folded paper.) 
CAPTAIN: Very well. I know you from somewhere. 
(Denes drops his book. Janos picks it up.) 
DENES: Oh, I think I must have dropped off. Thank you. 
(Astrid has left.)

[Palace kitchen]

(Jamie is eating at the kitchen table and Victoria is laying a trolley with cutlery for a meal when Astrid enters.) 
ASTRID: Sit down. Go on with what you're doing. We've got to rescue Denes. Get him away from the building. 
VICTORIA: There are guards everywhere. 
ASTRID: Yes, I know, but we must try. 
JAMIE: It's a pity we can't get him to the Doctor. 
ASTRID: That's exactly where I intend to take him. 
JAMIE: Well, what's your plan then? 
ASTRID: Look, I want you to, well, cause a diversion. 
JAMIE: What do you want me to do? 
ASTRID: Well, anything. But do it at eleven o'clock precisely. 
JAMIE: Eleven o'clock, right. 
ASTRID: I see, the second corridor on the right, thank you so much. 
(Astrid leaves because Griffin has entered.) 
JAMIE: Er, yes. 
GRIFFIN: Now we're a travel agency. I haven't met you before. What's wrong? It's bound to be something serious. 
VICTORIA: This is a friend of mine, Griff. 
GRIFFIN: He's not a cook like you, I hope? 
VICTORIA: No. 
GRIFFIN: Oh, well that's all right then. Well, I suppose this is as good a place as any for meeting friends. Come one, come all, I say! How's the food? Terrible. Terrible. I'll get the sack tonight, I swear I will. Maybe they'll shoot me. I won't have to worry anymore. No, they wouldn't do that, the firing squad'd miss me. 
FARIAH: How are you getting on with the food for Mister Denes? 
GRIFFIN: Well it's ready, such as it is. Now we don't want too much of a crowd in here. 
JAMIE: Well, I'll be on my way, then. 
GRIFFIN: No, no. You stay. I'll go. I'm only the chef here. 
(Griffin leaves.) 
FARIAH: Now, what can we give Mister Denes? 
JAMIE: Er, do you like working for Salamander, Fariah? 
VICTORIA: It must be wonderful travelling all over the world with him. 
FARIAH: I don't enjoy travelling. (She tastes the soup.) Oh, this is good. That Griff's a genius. 
JAMIE: Why travel then? 
FARIAH: Sometimes we do what we have to do, not what we want to do. 
JAMIE: You don't have to work for Salamander. 
FARIAH: Don't I? Don't I? What do you know about it? 
JAMIE: Sorry, I was just 
FARIAH: To you, Salamander is a god, isn't he? The saviour of the world. That's why you work for him. You saved his life, didn't you? 
JAMIE: I 
VICTORIA: Don't you protect his life every day? 
FARIAH: Yes! As I say, sometimes we do what we have to do, not what we want to do.

[Palace terrace]

(Nighttime. Salamander is writing.) 
BRUCE: Nevertheless, whatever he's done or not done, he should be treated according to rank. 
SALAMANDER: He will be moved soon. You can't expect much sympathy for him, you know, Bruce. Word gets around. I warned him about the earthquakes. He could have cautioned the people. Some of them might have been saved. 
BRUCE: Maybe. 
SALAMANDER: No maybe about it. 
BRUCE: Who's going to control this zone now? Fedorin? 
SALAMANDER: Fedorin. Oh, what a good idea.

[Palace kitchen]

GRIFFIN: Be nice to Mister Denes. 
VICTORIA: I will.

[Palace corridor]

(Victoria pushes the tea trolley along the flagstone corridor.) GRIFFIN: Give him a smile. It might make him forget the taste of the soup. 
(Griffin goes back into the kitchen. Fedorin is standing in front of the trolley.) 
FEDORIN: Oh, is this for Mister Denes? 
VICTORIA: Yes, yes, I'm taking it to him. 
FEDORIN: May I look? 
VICTORIA: Yes. 
FEDORIN: Mmm. Delicious. 
(Fedorin lifts the lids and palms the salt cellar) 
FEDORIN: Ah, very good. Where's the salt? 
VICTORIA: What? 
FEDORIN: You forgot something. 
VICTORIA: Oh, no. Well, I 
FEDORIN: Well, you run and get it. 
VICTORIA: Yes, yes. 
(Victoria runs back to the kitchen. Fedorin opens the box Salamander gave him. It contains crystals.)

[Palace terrace]

CAPTAIN: The same girl I saw in the park. I suddenly remembered. 
SALAMANDER: You say she was talking to the boy and girl? 
CAPTAIN: She was on the same bench. 
SALAMANDER: Coincidence? 
CAPTAIN: She wasn't in messengers' uniform then. She is now. 
SALAMANDER: Yes. She certainly hasn't delivered any messages to me. 
CAPTAIN: Shall I alert the building? 
SALAMANDER: No. No, I want to know where she comes from. Let her escape but have her followed. Frighten her away. 
CAPTAIN: I understand. And the other two? 
SALAMANDER: Oh, I'll deal with them.

[Palace corridor]

(Victoria arrives with the trolley.) 
FARIAH: Ah, good. 
VICTORIA: Sorry I've been so long. 
DENES: Oh, good. I'm looking forward to this. Thank you. 
CAPTAIN: Just a moment. Has the trolley been checked? 
JANOS: I was just going to, sir. 
(The Captain takes the knives from Denes.) 
CAPTAIN: Don't any of you know anything? 
DENES: Do you imagine I'm going to try and cut my way out of here? How do I eat without the knife? 
CAPTAIN: It's none of my concern. 
FARIAH: Try the spoon, Mister Denes. 
DENES: And how do you cut a steak with a spoon? 
(The Captain cuts the tiny piece of meat for him.) 
DENES: It's a long time since I had my food cut up for me. 
CAPTAIN: Watch him carefully. 
GUARD: Sir. 
DENES: Thank you for your courtesy. 
CAPTAIN: Fariah, come with me. I want a word with you and Griffin about breaking regulations. 
FARIAH: Yes, sir. 
(The Captain and Fariah leave.) 
VICTORIA: What's the time? 
DENES: Six minutes to eleven. 
VICTORIA: May I stay with you? I'm Victoria. 
DENES: Yes, of course. I'd be glad of your company. If you'll forgive me, I'm really rather hungry.

[Palace terrace]

FEDORIN: There must be some other way. I couldn't do it, Salamander, I couldn't do it. I stood there with this man's life in my hands and. This powder, I couldn't use it. 
SALAMANDER: I give you the chance to become something. Somebody. You failed to take it. 
FEDORIN: There must be some other way? 
(Salamander takes back the box of poison.) 
SALAMANDER: Of course, my friend. Don't worry. 
FEDORIN: What? 
SALAMANDER: Don't worry. You try, you fail, so what, huh? The moon doesn't fall out of the sky. Come, sit down, have a drink, huh? Cheer up. We find another way. 
(Salamander puts some of the poison into a wine glass.) 
FEDORIN: I really did try. 
SALAMANDER: Of course you did. Don't worry. Forget it, huh? I have an alternative. 
(Salamander hands the dosed glass to Fedorin.) 
SALAMANDER: Your health. I hope you'll appreciate this wine. It's made for me especially in Alaska. 
(Fedorin drinks, clutches at his throat, and dies.) 
SALAMANDER: One chance, my friend. I said one chance. 
CAPTAIN: Some trouble in the kitchens, Leader. The new man says he's seen someone in the kitchen gardens. 
SALAMANDER: Very well. Oh, see to that, will you? Suicide, of course. Such a pity.

[Kitchen]

GRIFFIN: I can't see anything. 
JAMIE: Over there by the trees. Hey, he's armed, too. Get down. Look, I'm going out there, you stay down here. When the rest of the guards come, send them out after me. 
GRIFFIN: Yes, all right. 
(Jamie goes out into the garden.) 
GRIFFIN: This is just about the end of a perfect day. 
(A shot rings out.) 
GRIFFIN: Hey, I know the food's bad, but you don't have to go that far! 
(More shots, and Griffin hides under the kitchen table.) 
GRIFFIN: All right, have it your own way. Why did I ever leave Wollamaloo?

[Palace corridor]

(An armed guard runs past Janos.) 
VICTORIA: Astrid's going to try and get you away. 
ASTRID: An attempt has been made to rescue this man. Get him out to the car. 
(Janos turns his back and Astrid knocks him out.) 
ASTRID: I'm sorry, Janos. 
CAPTAIN: Stop! 
(Denes is shot in the back.) 
CAPTAIN: After them! 
(Victoria pushes the trolley into the guards, who fall over it.) 
CAPTAIN: Get that girl!

[Palace terrace]

(Victoria and Jamie are under armed guard.) 
SALAMANDER: Well, we all seem to be here, except the third member of your escape committee. 
JAMIE: I don't know what you're talking about. 
SALAMANDER: You were seen speaking with a girl in the park. The one who tried to escape with Denes. 
VICTORIA: We don't know anything about that. We don't even know her. 
SALAMANDER: A diversion was caused! There was no one outside the kitchen. 
JAMIE: Of course there was someone, and there was shooting. 
CAPTAIN: Three shots have been fired from this gun. It's yours, isn't it? 
SALAMANDER: Pretending to save my life was ingenious. But ingenuity requires a constant stream of new ideas. Yours seem to have dried up. I come to the Central Zone. An attempt is made on my life. Denes proves to be a traitor. Fedorin commits suicide because I uncover him. Do your job, Bruce. You can see they're all in this. 
BRUCE: All right. Take them away. 
VICTORIA: Take your hands off me! 
(The Captain and guards lead Jamie and Victoria away.) 
BRUCE: Salamander, I think it's about time you told me what's going on. One minute I see you with this lad McCrimmon, you're working together, the next minute 
SALAMANDER: I thought he saved my life. 
BRUCE: No, I mean before that, in Kent's office. 
SALAMANDER: What are you talking about? 
BRUCE: Well, I saw you there. 
SALAMANDER: But I haven't seen Kent in months. 
BRUCE: Yes, you were with Kent, the Ferrier girl, and those two youngsters. I thought it was so curious I spoke to your number two, Benik, about it. That's really the reason I came to this zone. 
SALAMANDER: But I tell you! I must get back to the research centre. You will come with me. 
BRUCE: It was you! Or someone like you.

Episode Four

[Kent's trailer]

(Still outside the research station.) 
DOCTOR: Patience, Mister Kent, patience. 
KENT: Astrid should have been in contact by now. 
DOCTOR: Oh, perhaps her plan to infiltrate into Salamander's organisation has failed. 
KENT: Ah no, otherwise Benik's little visit here wouldn't have been so moderate. He wouldn't have stopped at breaking up the crockery. 
DOCTOR: Can't you contact her? 
KENT: If I knew where she was. Oh no, I know she's in the Central European zone, but that's a big place. No, we'll just have to sweat it out and wait. 
DOCTOR: But your friend Benik did indicate we weren't entirely welcome here, you know. 
KENT: Yes, it's not safe, and taking you from place to place isn't easy. And I mean, you're not exactly inconspicuous, are you? 
DOCTOR: Thank you. Well, I suggest we give her another hour, and then if she doesn't contact us by then, we'll move out and find out what has happened. 
(Meanwhile, Astrid has returned to Kent's office. She turns on the videolink.) 
KENT: Astrid, you're back. Switch to scramble.

[Records room]

ASTRID [on monitor]: Scramble? Are we being monitored? 
KENT [on monitor] It's possible. 
ASTRID [on monitor]: Right. Switching now. 
(The pictures and sounds scramble, so Benik turns on the security channel.) 
BENIK: Has Leader Salamander's ship arrived at the terminal? 
GUARD [on monitor]: I think it's due now, sir. 
BENIK: Good. Contact the guard. And I want the girl Astrid Ferrier traced. She's Giles Kent's assistant. I'll have an identiprint sent down immediately. She's somewhere in this zone. 
GUARD [on monitor]: Yes, sir. 
BENIK: Tell the Captain to inform me the moment he's found her, and to hurry. 
GUARD [on monitor]: Sir.

[Kent's office]

KENT [on monitor]: Denes dead? 
ASTRID: Yes, shot in the back. 
KENT [on monitor] : Well, it looks as if our friend Salamander's had a field day, doesn't it? 
ASTRID: I'm afraid I haven't done very well.

[Kent's trailer]

KENT: Don't worry. It's not your fault. Look, stay put and we'll join you.

[Kent's office]

(Transmission ends. There is a knock at the door. Astrid hides behind it as it opens, then pulls it wide to pull the visitor in.) 
ASTRID: You! What are you doing here? 
(Astrid pins Fariah to the desk.) 
ASTRID: No, don't be foolish. What are you doing here? 
FARIAH: I can't talk. You're choking me. 
ASTRID: One move. Just one move. 
(Astrid releases Fariah, but keeps her covered with a gun.) 
FARIAH: You think Salamander sent me here. 
ASTRID: Well, didn't he? 
FARIAH: No it was my own idea. I came here to see Giles Kent. 
ASTRID: Why? 
FARIAH: I have some information for him. 
ASTRID: Why should you want to help him? 
FARIAH: Because I hate Salamander probably even more than you do. I can help you to destroy him. I want to be there to see his face when he dies.

[Records office]

BENIK: Come on, come on. 
(The monitor lights up.) 
BENIK: About time too. Is the Captain there? 
GUARD [on monitor]: Yes, sir. 
CAPTAIN [on monitor]: Here, sir. The girl Astrid Ferrier. She was in the Central European zone. 
BENIK: Was she? Well she's here now. Have you found her? 
CAPTAIN [on monitor]: Well, I think so. One of my men saw someone answering her description going into Giles Kent's office earlier. 
BENIK: Was she alone? 
CAPTAIN [on monitor]: Yes, sir. But shortly after someone else followed her in. 
BENIK: Well who, man, who? 
CAPTAIN [on monitor]: Leader Salamander's food-taster sir, Fariah. 
BENIK: Fariah? Right, I want the place surrounded, and I'll join you there. Get a move on! 
CAPTAIN [on monitor]: Yes sir. 
BENIK: Fariah.

[Kent's office]

DOCTOR: But what are they going to do to Jamie and Victoria? 
ASTRID: I don't know. 
KENT: Hold them in the Central European zone until Salamander has time to deal with them. 
FARIAH: No, you're wrong. Salamander doesn't care for loose ends. He brought them back with him. 
DOCTOR: What, to his headquarters? The Research Centre? 
FARIAH: Yes. He's going to try to get information from them. 
DOCTOR: How far will he go to get it? 
FARIAH: Very far. 
DOCTOR: Oh, that's very comforting. 
FARIAH: I tell you, I know Salamander. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm not quite clear about your part in all this. You work for Salamander. Suddenly you fall over yourselves to betray him. 
FARIAH: I came here for that purpose, yes. 
DOCTOR: Why? 
FARIAH: Because I have every reason to hate Salamander. He blackmailed me into being his personal servant. I even had to smile when he told me to. 
KENT: What sort of blackmail? What had you done? 
FARIAH: Does it really matter? 
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, of course not, my dear. Well nobody's perfect, Kent. But I still can't help wondering why 
FARIAH: Why I haven't tried to expose Salamander? 
DOCTOR: Well you were in a unique position to do so. 
FARIAH: Because without any proof I'd be wasting my time. 
DOCTOR: Proof! Proof! Proof! It always comes back to the same thing. No one has any evidence against Salamander! 
KENT: We have some. 
DOCTOR: Not enough! It's not enough! Salamander covers up too well. 
FARIAH: I have what you want. 
ASTRID: But I thought that you said 
FARIAH: No. Not about me. Fedorin. 
ASTRID: Fedorin? A public embezzler who commits suicide? 
FARIAH: Salamander engineered nearly every one of those swindles, and I can prove it. 
ASTRID: How? 
(Fariah produces sheaf of documents.) 
FARIAH: Fedorin's file. 
DOCTOR: But that's wonderful. Let me see. I'll give it to you back. Thank you. 
(The Doctor inspects the documents.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes.

[Outside the office block]

GUARD: Report your position, A three. 
CAPTAIN: Keep well back sir. 
BENIK: Is the building surrounded? 
GUARD: A three's in position, Captain. 
CAPTAIN: Just closing up the gaps. 
BENIK: Well, you haven't brought me here on a fool's errand, I hope? 
CAPTAIN: Still inside, sir. 
BENIK: Where's Kent's office? 
CAPTAIN: Up on the second floor. 
BENIK: Right. We'll move in. 
CAPTAIN: Just a moment, sir. What about the roof? 
GUARD: No reply yet, Captain. Position A five, position. 
BENIK: Come on, come on.

[Kent's office]

DOCTOR: But I'm afraid this still isn't evidence. It's not real evidence. 
KENT: You mean even this doesn't convince you about Salamander? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm not saying that. 
ASTRID: Well then you'll do it? You'll impersonate him? 
FARIAH: And of course when they see you with me they're bound to think you're Salamander. 
DOCTOR: But I still don't know if I can carry it off. 
KENT: It's the only way to get your friends released. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
KENT: Of course, there are 
DOCTOR: Oh I see, yes, of course, there are conditions, aren't there? You help me. I defeat Salamander. 
KENT: Now look, you're giving me the biggest opportunity I'll ever have of ridding the world of this monster. Either I can convince you one way or I'll have to do it another. 
DOCTOR: What you really want me to do is to kill him, isn't it? 
KENT: What else do you do when someone is evil? 
DOCTOR: Private justice, eh? Oh no, no. I'll expose him, ruin him, have him arrested, but I won't be his executioner. No one has that right. 
KENT: Sometimes it's necessary. 
DOCTOR: No! 
KENT: Yes, Doctor, yes! When the inducement is strong enough, and in your case, yes. You still want your friends out of danger? 
DOCTOR: You can't bargain with people's lives like that! 
KENT: I can. Either you get rid of Salamander, or we won't lift a finger to help your friends. 
FARIAH: Mister Kent, look. 
(Kent goes to the window.) 
KENT: I'd make up my mind quickly if I were you. 
DOCTOR: Why? 
KENT: Have a look out of the window. 
DOCTOR: Well, what is it?

[Outside the office block]

GUARD: A five reporting in, Captain. Every man's in position now. 
CAPTAIN: Right, we'll move in. 
BENIK: Tell all men to shoot on sight. 
CAPTAIN: I can't accept responsibility like that, sir. 
BENIK: You won't have any responsibility unless you do as I say. These people are terrorists. Give the order! 
CAPTAIN: All A positions, shoot on sight. 
BENIK: Forward!

[Kent's office]

KENT: No doubt of it. They're security men. 
FARIAH: And they're closing in. 
DOCTOR: Well, isn't there another way out of here? 
KENT: The usual ways will be blocked. 
ASTRID: The fire escape. 
(Kent goes to another window.) 
KENT: Up there, look! 
(The guards are coming down from the roof.) 
DOCTOR: More down there, too. 
(At the bottom of the emergency exit.) 
FARIAH: What do we do now? 
KENT: Over here, quick! 
DOCTOR: What's that? 
KENT: Through here. The ventilator shaft. 
ASTRID: Giles, we can't. 
KENT: Yes, of course. 
FARIAH: Wait. The file. 
KENT: Come on, quickly. 
DOCTOR: But where does it go? 
KENT: It doesn't matter. Come on.

[Outside Kent's office]

CAPTAIN: It's locked. 
BENIK: Why don't you just let us in. It'll save so much unpleasantness.

[Kent's office]

KENT: Now look. Just relax and you won't feel a thing. 
(Fariah slides down the shaft.) 
KENT: Now you, Doctor, next. 
BENIK [OC]: Kent! Open the door. 
DOCTOR: Oh no, what about you? 
ASTRID: Oh no, you're too important. You go, and Giles. I'll follow. 
KENT: All right. 
BENIK [OC]: Very well.

[Outside Kent's office]

BENIK: You leave me no alternative. Break it down.

[Kent's office]

(Kent and the Doctor climb into the shaft.) 
BENIK [OC]: Get back! 
ASTRID: Get away from that door! 
BENIK [OC]: Can you hear me in there? Why don't you come out? 
ASTRID: I can hear you. 
BENIK [OC]: How long do you think you can hold out against us?

[Outside Kent's office]

BENIK: Standing by? 
GUARD: A five, progress. 
BENIK: Well? 
GUARD: He's outside the window now, sir. 
(In the office, Astrid feels a slight breeze and turns as a guard comes in through the window. He shoots at Astrid but misses.) 
BENIK: He's through, Sergeant. Smash that lock.

[Kent's office]

(The guard is lying on the floor.) 
BENIK: Well? Well? 
CAPTAIN: Empty. 
BENIK: The air ducts. They've disappeared through the air conditioning plant. Is there a manhole that could let them out to the street? 
GUARD: I don't know, sir. 
BENIK: Well, find out! 
CAPTAIN: On the double! Attention all A positions. Cover street. Send to the air conditioning plant. 
BENIK: Tell your men to shoot to kill! 
CAPTAIN: Shoot to kill, repeat shoot to kill. 
(Benik and the Captain leave. Astrid comes out from under the desk.)

[Alleyway]

(Fariah, with the file, has become separated from the others. She encounters a guard in an alleyway. He shoots her.) 
CAPTAIN: What do you think you're doing? 
GUARD: We had orders to kill. 
CAPTAIN: Do you always obey orders? 
GUARD: I'm sorry, Captain. 
CAPTAIN: Oh, never mind. Go and search for the others. 
(The guard leaves.) 
GUARD: I'm sorry. You should have stopped. 
BENIK: Did you get the others? 
GUARD: Not yet, sir. 
BENIK: Now listen to me. There was you, Astrid Ferrier, Giles Kent and another. Who was the other man? 
FARIAH: You'll know soon, soon enough. 
BENIK: I want to know now. 
CAPTAIN: Sir, you 
BENIK: Shut up! Well? 
FARIAH: You can't threaten me now, Benik. I can only die once. And someone's beaten you to it. 
BENIK: Who was the other man? 
GUARD: Sir? 
CAPTAIN: She's dead. 
BENIK: Good. 
(Benik picks up the papers.) 
BENIK: Fedorin's file. Thank you.

[Records room]

SALAMANDER: What you mean is you failed. 
BENIK: I always said something should be done about Kent. 
SALAMANDER: You always say. You say things but you don't think. 
BRUCE: You exceeded your authority, Benik. A woman's been killed. 
BENIK: Resisting arrest. 
BRUCE: Maybe. But you can't just take the law into your own hands. Giles Kent hadn't broken any rules that I know of. 
BENIK: I was sure he'd show himself one day. He was simply building up his resistance group. 
SALAMANDER: Resistance group. The man's a traitor! These people are rebels. Bruce, you must find this man who impersonated me. The dangers are obvious. He could walk in anywhere at any time pretending to be me and ruin everything. 
BRUCE: You can leave that to me. 
SALAMANDER: How so? 
BRUCE: Benik, come with me and I'll go over the security arrangements with you now. 
SALAMANDER: Do as you're told! 
(Benik produces Fedorin's file.) 
BENIK: I think you'll find this interesting. 
(Benik gives the file to Salamander.) 
SALAMANDER: What? The girl Fariah had this? What can I say? 
(Benik and Bruce leave. Salamander picks up an handset.) 
MAN [OC]: Yes, sir? 
SALAMANDER: The records room is out of bounds. I am not to be disturbed. See that the security locks are engaged. 
MAN [OC]: Very well, sir. For how long, sir? 
SALAMANDER: For as long as I say so. 
MAN [OC]: Yes sir. 
(Salamander types commands into a computer. Shutters slide down across the doors and a man-sized capsule slides out from a recess in a wall. Salamander enters it. The capsule slides back into the wall. Inside a hidden room Salamander activates a large wall-mounted computer system. The magnetic discs start spinning. He opens a wall cabinet. A board is lowered from the ceiling. Salamander puts on a helmet, lies on the board and straps himself on. He takes a control box from underneath, then reaches up and pulls down a plastic cover, sealing himself in. The board tilts until he is vertical, the floor opens and he descends down a narrow shaft. Very Thunderbirds.)

[Outside the records room]

BRUCE: Are you telling me that no one, no one at all can see Salamander? 
GUARD: No one, sir. 
BRUCE: Can you communicate with him on closed circuit? 
GUARD: I'll try, sir. He's turned off the master switch. Sorry, sir. 
BENIK: Here are the security details. What's the matter now? 
BRUCE: It seems that Salamander has locked himself away and can't be got at. 
BENIK: So? 
BRUCE: Well, suppose the place caught fire? 
BENIK: It won't. 
BRUCE: Don't be foolish! 
BENIK: Look, I can only tell you that when Salamander works in records, as he does from time to time, no one is allowed in. 
BRUCE: I could understand if it were a laboratory or a research room of some sort, but a records room? What sort of records have you got in there anyway? 
BENIK: What did you want to see him about? 
BRUCE: Never mind. I just don't like mysteries. Salamander's far too important to lock himself away like this. Anything might happen. A world emergency. Suppose I had to order you to let me in there? 
BENIK: It wouldn't do any good. When the locks are switched over they can only be opened from the inside.

[Underground control room]

(The place is brightly lit with instrument panels on the walls and plenty of scientific looking stuff, plus a desk and a small bed and the obligatory maniac's large wall map of the world. Salamander switches on the intercom)

[Underground main room]

(A group of gaunt figures are attending machines and wall panels.) 
SALAMANDER [OC]: I have returned. Take radiation precautions. I will make a report about the surface. 
SWANN: He's back. 
COLIN: He's managed to get back again. Let's hope he's got some good news this time. 
MARY: Do you think Salamander's found some more food, Swann? 
SWANN: I hope so, otherwise we're finished. Where's that stock list? 
COLIN: Here. 
SWANN: Thank you. 
MARY: Are you going to ask him? 
COLIN: You bet I am. He'll take me, too. 
MARY: Colin, I couldn't sleep a wink last night thinking about you making the trip. None of the others have come back. 
COLIN: Don't stop me now. I've got to see the surface, Mary, I've got to. I want to see the Sun again, walk on top of the Earth, not hide like a rat underground. I've got to do it, Mary. I've got to ask him. 
MARY: Yes.

[Underground control room]

SWANN: Welcome back, Salamander. Are you all right? 
SALAMANDER: Don't don't come too near, my friend. I am not yet decontaminated. I am too weary. Too utterly weary. 
SWANN: You shouldn't have made this trip, Salamander. You're doing too much. 
SALAMANDER: Someone has to bring back the food for you, my friend, huh? You know that the radiation is slowly killing me, don't you, Swann? 
SWANN: You're just doing too much. 
SALAMANDER: I worry about you all the time. What're you going to do when I am no longer here? 
(Salamander walks into a decontamination booth. The Geiger counter chatters.) 
SALAMANDER: The radiation gets a little more each time, huh? One day, that needle will stay at maximum radiation. 
MARY: Don't say that. 
SALAMANDER: Why, Mary, Colin. It's my big joke, huh? Just to frighten you a little. I've got good news for us. 
COLIN: We can return to the surface? 
SALAMANDER: No, no, no, not yet, but I've found another store of food. 
COLIN: Thank goodness! 
SALAMANDER: And is undamaged. Colin, open the last store of wine, huh? Go on, you help him too, Mary. 
(Colin and Mary leave.) 
SWANN: You must take it slowly, for goodness sake. 
SALAMANDER: I'm all right my friend, I'm just a little dizzy. It's terrible up there, you know. Swann, you've no idea. Right, I am ready.

[Underground main room]

(The wine is being poured.) 
SALAMANDER: Here we are, my friends. Oh please, no. It is enough that I am back with you again and I have brought food for you. Plenty of food. 
SWANN: Who can try? 
SALAMANDER: Please, Swann. I remembered on my way back down here that we are near our anniversary again. In a few short weeks we survivors will have been down in this shelter for exactly five years. 
CROWD: Five years. 
SALAMANDER: Colin and Mary were just teenagers then. Look at them now. We fed ourselves. But what's more than that, we are fighting back! We are doing something! 
CROWD: Yes! Yes! 
COLIN: Will we return to the surface, Salamander? 
SALAMANDER: Yes, of course we will. This is what I'm striving for. But up there, is terrible still. The war goes on and on, and you never know when the air is clean or when it's poison. 
COLIN: When can we return? 
SALAMANDER: We have to fight for a while longer, hmm? Creating natural disasters, monsoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, always in the places where the enemies of truth and freedom gather together. 
COLIN: You tell us this all the time, Salamander. When are we going to escape from this nightmare prison, that's all I'm asking you? 
MARY: Colin, please. 
COLIN: I want an answer! 
SALAMANDER: You shall have an answer, my friend. You will return to the surface when you have a good chance of survival. 
(Salamander staggers.) 
SALAMANDER: No, no, it's all right. But you must believe me. Colin, all of you. You cannot return to the surface until is safe to do so. Please my friend, we must 
(Swann helps Salamander back towards the control room.) 
MARY: He's doing his best. 
COLIN: I can't help it, Mary. Next time I'm going to make him take me with him. 
MARY: No. You know the others didn't come back. 
COLIN: I've got to. 
MARY: Then take me with you. I'd rather die with you up on the surface than live down here without you. 
(At the control room door.) 
SALAMANDER: No, Swann. We must check the power levels, huh? 
SWANN: All right, everyone to their places, please. Salamander wants to check the power levels. Come along there, come on. Full blast, that's right. Check the meter levels.

[Underground control room]

SWANN [OC]: Full power on line one, Salamander. 
SALAMANDER: Oh, good, good. 
SWANN [OC]: No faults indicated. 
SALAMANDER: Excellent. 
(Salamander lights a cigar.)

[Kent's trailer]

(Astrid is putting dark makeup on the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: But I still don't understand what's happened to Fariah. 
KENT: She went the wrong way. We lost her. 
DOCTOR: Well, we must find her! You don't seem to realise how vital it is. 
ASTRID: Doctor, hold still a moment will you? 
DOCTOR: Sorry. 
ASTRID: There. Look at that, Giles, isn't it amazing? 
KENT: Salamander to the life. 
DOCTOR: Yes, it's not bad. 
ASTRID: Shush, I think I heard something. 
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps it's Fariah? 
(Bruce enters with an armed guard.)

Episode Five

[Kent's trailer]

BRUCE: Stay where you are. I've been looking forward to meeting you again. Over there. No, not you. 
(Kent and Astrid move away from the Doctor.) 
BRUCE: Sit down, all of you. 
KENT: How did you find us? 
BRUCE: Your last visitor was Salamander's deputy, Benik. When he left, he fixed this underneath your trailer. 
ASTRID: A radio tracking device. 
KENT: On whose authority? 
BRUCE: Mine. 
(Bruce looks at the Doctor.) 
BRUCE: It's amazing how alike you and Salamander are. Incredible. You fooled me the first time we met, but now, even Salamander himself would think he was looking in a mirror. Why? You want this man to impersonate Salamander, why? How much are they paying you? 
DOCTOR: I beg your pardon? 
BRUCE: They want you to assassinate Salamander, don't they? Take his place? 
DOCTOR: But that's ridiculous! I couldn't possibly do that. 
BRUCE: But you were preparing to impersonate him, weren't you? 
DOCTOR: Well, well, yes. 
BRUCE: All right then, why? 
DOCTOR: Because Salamander holds my two friends prisoner and I was going to attempt to rescue them. 
ASTRID: And at the same time get evidence that would expose Salamander as a traitor, blackmailer and murderer. 
BRUCE: Quite an ambitious plan. How do you know such evidence exists? 
KENT: It exists in Salamander's records. 
BRUCE: Oh, yes, I know why you want Salamander out of the way. You hate him because he exposed your profitable sideline of misusing public money. 
ASTRID: Oh, it was Salamander who was misusing the money. 
KENT: And I was dismissed from my post and the evidence against Salamander concealed. 
BRUCE: So you say. But you've no evidence at all against Salamander, have you? 
KENT: I tell you the evidence is in Salamander's records. 
BRUCE: And I'm expected to take that from you? 
DOCTOR: We do hold evidence that Salamander isn't quite so pure and white as he's painted. 
BRUCE: No? What? 
DOCTOR: A file, containing certain information about a gentleman called Fedorin. 
ASTRID: Salamander was going to use this evidence against Fedorin. Blackmail him into submission. After he'd got rid of Denes, that is. 
KENT: And so gain control of another zone. 
BRUCE: Where is this file? 
DOCTOR: Fariah has it. Salamander's food taster. 
BRUCE: Fariah? But she's dead. 
DOCTOR: Dead? But how? 
BRUCE: She was shot by one of Benik's guards escaping arrest. 
KENT: Escaping arrest? Benik had her killed because she had evidence against Salamander. 
ASTRID: And Benik will return the file to Salamander. We must get to the Research Station. 
BRUCE: You're not going anywhere or doing anything. As far as I'm concerned this story you've told me could be a pack of lies to cover your attempt to assassinate Salamander. Now I'm not saying I'm altogether satisfied with Salamander or his organisation, but I'll investigate in my own way. 
KENT: Meanwhile Salamander will have found a way to cover himself, and also a way of disposing of you. You're digging your own grave, Bruce. 
BRUCE: That's my affair. And I do things my own way. 
(Astrid grabs the guard's gun.) 
ASTRID: And I do things my way. Really, as Head of Security, you should have more reliable guards.

[Outside the records room]

BENIK: Leader Salamander? 
GUARD: Still inside, sir. 
BENIK: Let me know the moment the doors are opened. 
GUARD: Yes sir. 
(Two stretchers are carried across the corridor, with Jamie and Victoria on them.) 
BENIK: So you've brought them? Good. Any trouble? 
CAPTAIN: No, a light drug saw to that. 
BENIK: Let me know the moment they wake up. 
CAPTAIN: Yes, sir. 
BENIK: I'm looking forward to questioning them. I have a feeling they're going to be stubborn. So much more interesting when our prisoners are stubborn.

[Kent's trailer]

BRUCE: You're only making trouble for yourself. Killing me won't get you anywhere. 
ASTRID: We have to get to the Research Station, and you're not going to stop us. 
BRUCE: But you're completely surrounded. You don't really believe I came here with just one guard, do you? You'd be very silly to try and fight your way out. I'd give you about thirty seconds to live if you try.
KENT: All right, Bruce, we might have just thirty seconds but you'd have exactly half that time, if you were lucky! 
DOCTOR: Please, Mister Kent! You're forgetting one very important thing. 
KENT: What? 
DOCTOR: Me. Without me you haven't got an earthly chance of getting in that control centre. 
KENT: So? 
DOCTOR: I told you before, I will not have anything to do with violence. 
KENT: And what about your two friends? Are you going to leave them to the tender mercies of Salamander? 
DOCTOR: No, I am not. May I? 
(The Doctor holds his hand out to Astrid.) 
ASTRID: What? 
DOCTOR: Please? Just trust me. 
(Astrid gives the gun to the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: Now then, I think you agree that at this moment your life is in my hands. 
(The Doctor offers the gun to Bruce.) 
KENT + ASTRID: What are you doing? 
BRUCE: Hold it. 
DOCTOR: It's all right. Mister Bruce isn't going to shoot anyone, are you. 
BRUCE: Why? Why'd you do that? 
DOCTOR: Because I think I know what sort of man you are. Honest and reasonable. 
BRUCE: Go on. 
DOCTOR: I gave you back that gun because I trust you. Now I want you to trust me. 
BRUCE: You must be a complete fool or very clever. 
DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid you will have to make up your mind to that right away. 
BRUCE: What do you hope to gain by this gesture? 
DOCTOR: Your confidence. 
BRUCE: Do you believe Kent's accusations against Salamander? 
DOCTOR: I think there's reasonable doubt about Salamander's personal integrity, but there's only one way to get proof. 
BRUCE: By getting into Salamander's Research Station. 
DOCTOR: Yes. And my two young friends may have some information. 
BRUCE: And if there isn't any evidence? 
DOCTOR: Then you'll be perfectly free to arrest us and put us in prison, won't you? 
BRUCE: All right, I'll do it. On one condition. 
DOCTOR: And what's that? 
BRUCE: That you and I go alone. Kent and the girl stay here as hostages. 
KENT: Now wait a minute. I must go with him. 
BRUCE: No, Kent, you stay here. I must be mad to trust you. I only hope your impersonation of Salamander fools Benik. If it doesn't, we're in dead trouble. Here, take this. 
(Bruce gives the gun to the guard.) 
BRUCE: Keep those two in the caravan. Oh, and watch the girl. Come on.

[Underground control room]

SALAMANDER: Swann, I'm back in the control room.

[Underground main room]

SALAMANDER [OC]: I placed the new food cases on the conveyor. Detail some men to unload them. Then make a report on schedule seven. 
SWANN: Jones, Morris, Hunt. Now remember, if there's any contamination showing up at all on the register you must tell me immediately. 
COLIN: Swann? Have you ever thought what would happen to us if Salamander didn't come back from the surface one day? 
SWANN: No. He always comes back. And talk like that isn't healthy. I've told you about this before, Colin. 
COLIN: You can live in a dream world if you want to. 
SWANN: Morale is important down here. 
COLIN: Reality is important, too. Facing facts! 
MARY: Colin. 
COLIN: Yes, all right. I know. 
(Colin moves away.) 
MARY: I'm sorry, Swann. 
SWANN: He's the best man I've got. 
MARY: I know. 
SWANN: If only he'd just accept that everything will 
MARY: He never will. 
SWANN: He must be more patient then. We'll get out of here one day. 
MARY: Will we? 
SWANN: Of course we will. Salamander says so. 
MARY: Yes. 
(Swan moves away. Mary goes over to Colin.) 
COLIN: Blind idiot. Why do you think everybody else has to be an idiot too? 
MARY: We daren't let people think, Colin. Swann's all right. 
COLIN: I don't think it's right. Just work, sleep, eat, if there's enough to go round. Like worms under the earth, sightless worms wriggling about without hope, without purpose. 
MARY: It isn't like that. 
COLIN: Isn't it? All this? Every day I ask myself what are we doing down here. 
MARY: You've never doubted him before. 
COLIN: I don't know. I don't say I doubt him, but just once, Mary, just once I want to see with my own eyes what's going on up there. Me. Not hear about it from anybody else. SWANN: Are you getting on with your work? Mustn't fall behind, you know. Come on, Colin. We all get depressed. I know how you feel. 
COLIN: Sorry. 
SWANN: That's all right. 
(Swann goes to the food crates.) 
SWANN: Ah, how we getting on here? Ah, all this? That's a good haul. 
SALAMANDER [OC]: Stand by to make your report, Swann. 
(Swann notices a piece of paper stuck to a crate. It is a newspaper headline - Holiday liner sinks, many feared dead - and a date.) 
MARY: Reaching full power here, Swann. 
SWANN: Salamander, I must see you.

[Underground control room]

SALAMANDER: Not now, we are too busy. 
SWANN [OC]: This is urgent. 
SALAMANDER: Oh very well. 
(Swann enters with the piece of paper.) 
SALAMANDER: Now what's the matter, huh? 
SWANN: What's this? What is this? 
SALAMANDER: What? 
SWANN: Newspaper. It's a piece of newspaper. 
SALAMANDER: So? 
SWANN: Well, go on, look at it. Read it. Last year's date. Look at the bit of headline there. There! 
SALAMANDER: Control yourself, Swann. You'll go mad. 
SWANN: Holiday Liner Sinks! You say there's a global war, radiation everywhere. How can there be holiday liners? Tell me how? You've lied to us, haven't you? Haven't you! 
SALAMANDER: In a way, Swann, yes. I had to. 
SWANN: Had to? What do you mean had to? 
SALAMANDER: Well, it's true that the war is over, but have you any idea what happens to people who've been involved in a nuclear war? Have you? 
SWANN: Of course I haven't, I've been down here. 
SALAMANDER: Those who are lucky enough to escape the annihilation have their bodies eaten away by radiation poisoning. They're deformed in mind and body. 
SWANN: But this, this, this newspaper? 
SALAMANDER: They have a kind of society, but it's evil, corrupt. You don't think I could expose you to that sort of thing? Think of Mary and the other women. 
SWANN: You could have told me at least. 
SALAMANDER: I decided not to. 
SWANN: You should have told me. 
SALAMANDER: I thought it was best. 
SWANN: And what about the natural disasters we've been organising? The volcanoes, earthquakes? 
SALAMANDER: Swann, they're not fit to live. 
SWANN: You're murdering them, killing them off. 
SALAMANDER: I want you and the others to inherit the Earth. Make a new world. 
SWANN: Yes, I know all about that, but not at the price of wholesale murder. 
SALAMANDER: It's not murder! If you could see you would understand. It's an act of mercy. 
SWANN: There must be some other way. 
SALAMANDER: No! 
SWANN: I won't take your word any more. I want to see for myself. 
SALAMANDER: You'd be horrified. 
SWANN: Maybe. 
SALAMANDER: The radiation would kill you. 
SWANN: I'll chance that. 
SALAMANDER: Very well. But promise me one thing. You won't tell the others. 
SWANN: Why shouldn't I? 
SALAMANDER: Because I am right and you are wrong! You wouldn't want to, you wouldn't want to hurt them like that, huh? 
SWANN: And if you're lying, and I want to tell when I get back? 
SALAMANDER: How can I stop you? You'd better tell them you're coming with me. Say you've persuaded me. Swann, trust me. Don't go ahead with this, huh? 
SWANN: I have to.

[Underground main room]

SWANN [OC]: This is Swann speaking. It's nearly a year since anyone went on the surface with Salamander. 
COLIN: Salamander's changed his mind. He's going to take me with him.

[Underground control room]

SWANN: There are more stores to bring down too. Salamander can't do it all on his own. We'll both be back soon with good news, I hope.

[Underground main room]

COLIN: Why not me? Why? I asked him. He turned me down. 
MARY: Colin. 
COLIN: Why not me? Why not me! Salamander, take me with you! Take me with you! 
MARY: He's gone. It's no good. Please, Colin. 
COLIN: Why didn't he take me? I've got to get out of here, Mary. Got to get out.

[Interrogation room]

VICTORIA: Jamie? Jamie? 
JAMIE: What? Oh. 
VICTORIA: Here, drink this. The headache soon goes. 
JAMIE: Where are we? 
VICTORIA: I don't know. 
JAMIE: Let's find out. 
(Benik enters with a guard.) 
BENIK: Don't leave us so soon. We can have a little talk. 
JAMIE: Where are we? 
BENIK: You're in the Australasian zone. I had you brought here especially. 
JAMIE: Why? 
BENIK: So that Salamander could ask you some questions. 
JAMIE: For all the answers he's going to get he might as well have left us there. 
BENIK: Stand up when you talk to me! 
JAMIE: You'll get nowhere by shouting. 
BENIK: On the contrary. I'm going to get everything I want from you two. 
JAMIE: We'll not tell you a thing. 
BENIK: That's good. I like that. 
JAMIE: What? 
BENIK: Spirit. Resistance. And you've got plenty of both, haven't you, boy? Well I wonder how long you'll last. Five minutes? No, a little longer, maybe. Ten, perhaps? 
JAMIE: What do you mean? 
BENIK: Come now, you don't think I'm just going to sit here and ask questions, do you? 
JAMIE: You must have been a nasty little boy. 
BENIK: Oh, I was. But I had a very enjoyable childhood. 
(Jamie punches the guard, but Benik gets Victoria in a strangle-hold with a gun at her head.) 
BENIK: Yes, I thought so. Spirit, plenty of spirit. 
(Benik releases Victoria.) 
BENIK: Oh, we're going to enjoy ourselves, aren't we? Now then. 
VICTORIA: I thought you were going to take us to see Salamander? 
BENIK: Yes, I will. But he'll expect me to do my little best first. 
JAMIE: You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you. 
BENIK: Will you? How? No. I think the time's come for you to answer my questions, don't you? Come here, girl! If you don't, I shall have to shoot one of you. Oh, not a mortal wound. In the leg, perhaps? 
JAMIE: You'd better go. Don't worry. 
BENIK: There, that's better. Oh, such pretty hair, don't you think. 
JAMIE: All right, leave her alone. What do want to know? 
BENIK: Quite a lot. And you're going to tell me everything, aren't you. 
JAMIE: All right. Yes. 
BENIK: Who's behind you? Is it Giles Kent? 
(The door opens.) 
SALAMANDER: Ah, so they're here, are they? 
BENIK: Salamander, I thought you were in Records? 
SALAMANDER: Have they told you anything yet? 
BENIK: Not yet. 
SALAMANDER: Very well. Bruce and I will take over. You may go. And take your little puppy dog with you, hm? 
(Benik and his guard leave.) 
SALAMANDER: Now. 
JAMIE: We can't tell you anything. 
SALAMANDER: Of course not. We know everything. We know about Giles Kent, we know about the girl called Astrid, and we know about your friend the Doctor. 
VICTORIA: I don't believe you. 
SALAMANDER: A childish plan to impersonate me. That's the truth, isn't it? 
JAMIE: Ah, but he didn't agree to it. 
SALAMANDER: You two were sent to the Central European zone to stir up trouble. VICTORIA: If you want to know he truth, Giles Kent told us a story and we weren't sure. Before the Doctor could do anything we had to come here and find out what person you were like. 
JAMIE: Yeah, and we found that out right enough. 
SALAMANDER: You see, Bruce, they just terrorists. Not very big fry, either. All this nonsense about proof against me. 
VICTORIA: If you're doing so much good for the world, why are you so afraid for your own life? 
JAMIE: Aye, why do you have so many enemies? 
VICTORIA: Personal guards. 
JAMIE: Your own food taster. 
VICTORIA: And why destroy the one man people trusted, Alexander Denes? 
JAMIE: Aye. 
BRUCE: What do you mean, destroy? 
VICTORIA: One of your men shot him. 
BRUCE: Trying to escape? 
VICTORIA: He shot him deliberately. 
JAMIE: Aye. And that girl Fariah, well, she was close to Salamander. She'd speak against him. I know she would. 
SALAMANDER: Fariah is dead. 
VICTORIA: Dead? 
JAMIE: You've had her murdered too, have you? 
VICTORIA: Why you. 
DOCTOR: Oh, Victoria, don't hit me! You wouldn't hit your old friend the Doctor, would you? I wouldn't leave you in the tender mercy of Salamander. 
JAMIE: Doctor? 
DOCTOR: You don't believe me. Oh. 
(The Doctor pats his pockets, then whistles 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.) 
DOCTOR: Only you made me leave it in the Tardis. 
JAMIE: It is him! 
VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor! 
BRUCE: Tardis? Tardis? What's that? 
DOCTOR: It's a little place that we three have in common. You must admit they thought I was Salamander to begin with. 
BRUCE: Yes. I concede that. But there's still no proof. 
DOCTOR: No, but there's enough doubt in your mind to make you go on asking questions, isn't there. That's why we came here.

[Outside the records room]

BENIK: I told you to let me know when Salamander was out of Records. 
GUARD: But no one's come out, sir. 
BENIK: What did you say? 
GUARD: He hasn't come out, sir.

[Underground tunnel]

SWANN: Wait. What happens up there? 
SALAMANDER: Oh, it ends in a ruined building. This is where I bring the stores. You would be safer here. 
SWANN: Safer? 
SALAMANDER: Yes, the radiation. I don't think it filters down here. 
SWANN: I still want to see the surface. 
SALAMANDER: You will, you will.

[Kent's trailer]

KENT: I should have insisted on going with him. Bruce should have taken me. 
ASTRID: You know he doesn't trust you. 
KENT: He wouldn't trust his own grandmother. 
ASTRID: Oh, never mind, Giles. We've come a long way. Months ago, well a few weeks ago even, nobody would have even listened to you. 
KENT: Ah, maybe. 
ASTRID: There's no maybe about it. 
KENT: Yeah, perhaps you're right. Bruce listens to us at last. He's even prepared to ask questions, that's fine, but I know Salamander. He'd talk his way out of a quicksand. 
ASTRID: Well, what else can we do? The guard's still outside. 
KENT: I must get into the Research Centre. I've got to make sure that Bruce understands the evidence. Understands it, Astrid. Don't you realise he mightn't know what he's looking for. I know. 
ASTRID: But we can't attack the guard. It would only make matters worse. 
KENT: Not if I was to give Bruce real evidence. 
ASTRID: Giles, how long would it take you to get to the Research Station? 
KENT: Well, just a few minutes. I've got a pass. It's just a matter of getting there. 
ASTRID: All right, I think I can help you. I'll draw the guard off and leave you alone. 
KENT: You think you can do it? 
ASTRID: Yes, I think so. 
KENT: But I thought you said we weren't going to attack the guard? 
ASTRID: Oh, we're not going to attack the guard. But there is going to be an attack. A fatal one.

[Underground tunnel]

(It is littered with packing cases and equipment.) 
SWANN: Where does this lead? 
SALAMANDER: It goes on up and comes out in a field. 
SWANN: What about radiation? 
SALAMANDER: Here it's almost negligible. 
SWANN: You mean you could have brought others here from below? I don't understand you. Don't you realise what a break it would be for them, just moving away from that underground tomb once in a while?
SALAMANDER: You seem to forget, Swann, I've brought people up here before. There's always an element of risk. 
SWANN: I still want to have a look at these people you say are living on the surface. Where does that lead? 
SALAMANDER: Oh, that's a dead end. It's a place I sometimes rest. It's very hard work, you know, bringing all the 
SWANN: Yes, I know that. This way, then? 
SALAMANDER: You sure you won't change your mind, huh? 
(Behind Swann, Salamander picks up a crowbar.)

[Kent's trailer]

(Astrid uses a sauce bottle to break the window. The guard rushes in. Kent is lying on the divan with a red stain on his forehead.) 
GUARD: What's going on here? 
ASTRID: He's been shot through the window. 
GUARD: All right, stand back. He's finished. Better get a doctor anyway, just in case. 
(Astrid runs out.) 
GUARD: Hey! Come back! 
(The guard chases after her. Kent gets up, wipes off the ketchup, picks up his jacket and leaves.)

[Field]

(Astrid hides amongst rocks as the guard runs across the field.) 
SWANN [OC]: (faint) Help! Somebody help me. 
(Astrid finds the hidden tunnel entrance.) 
SWANN [OC]: Help!

[Underground tunnel]

(A short way in Astrid finds a man on the floor, with a bad cut on the back of his head.) 
SWANN: Help. Somebody help me. 
ASTRID: Who did this to you? 
SWANN: A man named Salamander. 
ASTRID: Salamander?

Episode Six

[Underground tunnel]

SWANN: Down there. 
ASTRID: Down there?

[Interrogation room]

DOCTOR: What other explanation is there? 
BRUCE: Now wait a moment. Are you seriously trying to tell me without a shred of evidence that Salamander is attacking the world with natural disasters? 
JAMIE: He must be. 
DOCTOR: That's what I believe. 
BRUCE: But it's beyond belief! How could he possibly? 
DOCTOR: I'm sure we'll find proof in the Records Room. 
BRUCE: Maybe, but that's where Salamander is. 
DOCTOR: Ah. Well, we shall have to wait until he comes out, won't we? 
(Benik enters.)

[Underground tunnel]

SWANN: Water. 
ASTRID: What? 
SWANN: Water. 
ASTRID: Yes. 
SWANN: No, no. Salamander's place. Danger. 
ASTRID: Right. Be careful. I'll get you some water. 
(Astrid goes along the tunnel to where water is dribbling down the wall.

[Interrogation room]

DOCTOR: (as Salamander) Really, Benik, I'm beginning to wondering why I pay you such a monstrously high salary. Worrying me over trifles. Make your own decision! Is that all? 
BENIK: You have to sign these passes for the hovertruck food supply. 
DOCTOR: What, now? 
BENIK: Well, you always told me they had priority over everything. 
DOCTOR: Oh, very well. 
(The Doctor takes the forms and looks at them.) 
BENIK: By the way. 
DOCTOR: Yes? 
BENIK: The door to the Record Room is jammed. It was all right when you came out, wasn't it? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
BENIK: Well it won't open now. May I have your key? 
(The Doctor checks his pockets.) 
DOCTOR: I'm going mad. I left it in there. What a fool. 
BENIK: It's all right, I'll use the emergency key. 
DOCTOR: Yes, do that, will you. Right away. Oh, please don't wait for these. 
(Benik leaves.) 
DOCTOR: (normal) That was close. 
BRUCE: How long was he standing there listening to us? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. 
JAMIE: Do you think he's on to us? 
DOCTOR: I hope not. But he's done us a good turn in bringing me these. This'll interest you, Bruce. How many people do you say work in the research centre? 
BRUCE: Fewer than you'd think. It's fully automated, you know. Six engineers, and six guards on duty at any one time. 
DOCTOR: A dozen, eh? Will you tell me why thirty people are catered for here?

[Underground tunnel]

(Astrid holds a damp handkerchief to Swann's mouth.) 
SWANN: The war. How bad was the war? 
ASTRID: War? I didn't understand you. I wish there was something I could do for you. 
SWANN: What's he done? What's he done? He's kept us prisoners. Listen, there are others. There are more people down the shaft. Salamander's kept us down there, prisoners, years of it. Promise you'll bring them to the surface. Swear it. You've got to swear it. 
(Swann dies.) 
ASTRID: I swear it.

[Interrogation room]

(The Doctor is speaking into a communicator, as Salamander.) 
DOCTOR: This is Salamander. I want a security escort to come to the interrogation room immediately. I am releasing two prisoners. They are to be conducted to the main gates and set free. Is that understood? Good. 
(The Doctor puts down the handset.) 
DOCTOR: (normal) Well, I hope that works. 
JAMIE: So do I. 
VICTORIA: What do you want us to do when we get outside? 
BRUCE: There are plenty of public phones in the area. Dial double zero one and ask for a man named Forrester. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
BRUCE: He's my deputy to this area. 
VICTORIA: Double zero one Forrester. 
BRUCE: Tell him where I am and just say redhead. 
VICTORIA: Redhead. 
BRUCE: Redhead. Is that clear? 
JAMIE: Redhead? Is that your wife? 
BRUCE: It's our emergency call. 
JAMIE: Sorry. 
(The intercom buzzes.) 
DOCTOR: (as Salamander) Salamander. Is the pass in order? Very well, you have my authority. 
JAMIE: What's all that about? 
DOCTOR: (normal) We have a visitor. Now Bruce, you're going to get your proof, but I want you to do one thing. 
BRUCE: What? 
DOCTOR: I want you to take my two friends to the gates and see they get away all right. 
BRUCE: What are you going to do? 
DOCTOR: You are to go straight to the Tardis as soon as you can. 
JAMIE: No, wait a minute. 
BRUCE: What is this Tardis? 
VICTORIA: It's a sort of space. 
DOCTOR: Shh. 
VICTORIA: House. House we live in. 
BRUCE: I don't think you heard me the first time. What are you going to do?

[Underground main room]

MARY: Please eat some of them, Colin. 
COLIN: I will, but later. 
(A buzzer sounds.) 
MARY: He's coming back. 
COLIN: Right. This time I'm going to have it out with Salamander.

[Underground control room]

(The decent chamber door opens and Astrid comes out. She has a good look around at the charts and papers. Then she manages to open the door to the main room.)

[Underground main room]

MAN: Who's that? 
(The people hide from her.) 
ASTRID: Where are you? 
MAN [OC]: Keep away. Get back. 
(They throw small things at her.) 
ASTRID: I've come to help you. 
(The people come out, brandishing sticks and other weapons. They force Astrid into a corner.) 
COLIN: What's the matter with you? Are you all mad? Get back! Get back! 
ASTRID: Thanks. 
COLIN: First, don't move. I don't know who you are, but you must be carrying radiation. 
ASTRID: What? 
COLIN: You're from the surface, aren't you? 
ASTRID: Radiation? How'd you get down here? 
COLIN: Did you see Salamander? And Swann? What about Swann? 
ASTRID: Swann sent me. 
MARY: Swann? Where is he? 
ASTRID: He's dead. 
MARY: You see, Colin, Salamander was right. He always said if we went up to the surface we'd die of radiation. 
ASTRID: No, not radiation. Salamander killed him. 
CROWD: No. No. I don't believe her. She's lying to you. It can't be true. 
ASTRID: He's been keeping you prisoners, I don't know why. Now listen to me. 
COLIN: Now, wait! We must decontaminate you. There's equipment in Salamander's control room. In there. 
ASTRID: All right.

[Underground control room]

COLIN: In there. You see? Radiation. 
(The meter drops to zero.) 
COLIN: You can come out now. 
ASTRID: I'm all right? 
COLIN: Yes. Now tell us, what's this about Swann? 
ASTRID: No. Just watch. 
(Astrid takes a ruler from the desk.) 
ASTRID: Look at the meter. 
(Astrid puts the ruler the booth. The meter rises to danger then drops to zero again.) 
ASTRID: This machine's a fake. Is this ruler contaminated? Look, see those valves? There's an invisible ray. Break it, and it works the meter. 
COLIN: But Salamander built this. 
MARY: He built it. He always uses it when he comes down. 
ASTRID: Yes, I know, to try to convince you for some reason or other that there's radiation above ground. 
MARY: There is. The war. 
ASTRID: War? What war? 
COLIN: Where is he? Where's Salamander? 
ASTRID: That's just what I would like to know. 
(Salamander is in the records room.)

[Research station corridor]

(Jamie and Victoria meet the Captain.) 
CAPTAIN: Wait. Where are you going? 
JAMIE: Leader Salamander's orders. 
CAPTAIN: What orders? 
JAMIE: He's released us. 
CAPTAIN: I wasn't informed. 
BRUCE: I was. 
CAPTAIN: Where are the release papers? 
BRUCE: Are you questioning my word? 
CAPTAIN: No, of course not, sir, but there are strict rules. 
BRUCE: Rules? Really? You forget, I'm World Security Controller. I make rules and break them. And men, Captain. Come on, you two. 
CAPTAIN: Find Deputy Benik. Quickly. 
GUARD: Sir!

[Underground control room]

ASTRID: But I can only take two at a time. 
MARY: I'm sure they all understand that. 
COLIN: Where is he? I must find Salamander. 
MARY: Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with them? 
ASTRID: No. Now that Swann's dead you two seem to be the leaders. After what you've told me we must confront the man that started all this, face to face.

[Research station corridor]

(Giles Kent adjusts a wall monitor to show the interior of the records room. He sees Salamander sitting at the desk. Kent hides as Benik and a guard walk round the corner.) 
GUARD: Yes, sir, the door's jammed and I can't get a view of the inside of it all. 
BENIK: Right. So Bruce and the rest of them are in the interrogation room. 
GUARD: Yes, sir. The Captain felt something was wrong and so do I, sir. One minute Leader Salamander's locked in the Records room, the next he's in the interrogation room. It doesn't make sense, sir. 
BENIK: Of course it doesn't make sense if you haven't got any sense. Just stand guard and try and keep your wits about you. 
GUARD: Yes, sir. 
(Benik leaves. Kent comes out of hiding and opens the records room door.)

[Records room]

SALAMANDER: Giles Kent. What are you doing here? 
KENT: Oh, I've been looking forward to this meeting. You're getting careless. You didn't double lock the doors. Oh, its all right, I've done it now. The only way anybody can get through there is to blast their way through. 
SALAMANDER: How did you get into the Research Centre? 
KENT: Oh, you know me. There isn't a pass in the world I can't get my hands on if I put my mind to it. 
SALAMANDER: You won't find it so easy getting out. 
KENT: Really? Well, we'll see. I'm not on my own this time. I've got friends here with me, and between us we're going to fix you once and for all. 
SALAMANDER: You always were a tiresome man, Kent. 
KENT: I'm going to be more than tiresome this time. You know the biggest mistake you ever made was not killing me when you had the chance. 
SALAMANDER: Oh, so you going to kill me huh? How petty. What good do you think that will do? 
KENT: Hold it! Now, don't move quickly. My nerves are a bit shaky at the moment.

[Outside the records room]

(Bruce and Benik are watching on the wall monitor.) 
BRUCE: We must get in there somehow. 
BENIK: We can't without the emergency key, and Salamander has it in there. 
GUARD: We could burn our way in. 
BENIK: Never. 
BRUCE: Why not? 
BENIK: It's an X-structure alloy, you'd hardly scratch the surface. 
BRUCE: We'll have to try it. Get the gear up here, fast.

[Records room]

KENT: Never get away with it. Oh, that's good, coming from you. Don't you realise you're dispensable, and the world is going to get along fine without you from now on. The only good idea you ever had in your life was getting rid of me and you couldn't even do that properly, could you? And now I'm back and you're finished. Oh, what's that? 
SALAMANDER: They're breaking down the door. 
(Keeping his gun on Salamander, Kent adjusts a monitor to view what is happening outside.) 
KENT: They don't appear to be having much success.

[Outside the records room]

GUARD: It's not cutting, sir. 
BRUCE: Never mind, keep at it. 
GUARD: It's no good sir. 
BRUCE: Keep going! 
(Far below, the decent chamber door closes and the lift begins to rise to the surface.)

[Records room]

SALAMANDER: You're trapped, aren't you? 
KENT: You're a fool, Salamander. You don't think I've forgotten already, do you? 
SALAMANDER: What? 
KENT: I've been with you too many times in this room in the past, not to know where this leads to. 
(The concealed capsule slides out from the wall.) 
KENT: Your little bolt-hole. Half way down the tunnel, a passage out to the fields and enough explosives down there to stop you or your thugs following me. 
DOCTOR: (normal) Well, that's very interesting, Mister Kent. Why didn't you tell me that before? 
KENT: Oh no, it can't be. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm afraid it is. Oh, look. Here's another surprise for you. Look behind you. 
KENT: Astrid, you've come just in time. 
ASTRID: It's too late, Giles. I know everything. 
COLIN: That's him. That's the man who took us down there in the first place. 
MARY: Giles Kent. We thought you were dead. 
KENT: Now look, I've never seen these people before in my life. 
ASTRID: They've told me everything. You and Salamander were in it together.

[Underground room]

(Somewhere in the underground complex, Salamander himself is watching it all on a monitor screen.) 
ASTRID [on monitor]: You built an atomic shelter, took some people down for an endurance test. The next person they saw was Salamander.

[Records room]

ASTRID: Who told them that an atomic war had started. 
DOCTOR: You see, Kent. 
ASTRID: Oh, be careful, Doctor. He'll kill you. 
MARY: You kept us down like animals. 
COLIN: Why? Why did you do it to us? 
KENT: We had to have someone create the natural disasters, didn't we, and we fooled you all! 
DOCTOR: You didn't fool me, Kent. 
KENT: You didn't suspect me. 
DOCTOR: Any man who resorts to murder as eagerly and as rapidly as you must be suspect. You didn't just want to expose Salamander, you wanted to kill him and take his place. 
KENT: And I will! Do you think you're going to stop me? And these people? Now move out of the way, quick! We'll see who'll stop me! 
(Kent gets into the capsule and it does down.) 
DOCTOR: Stop him. Stop him. He's going to try and blow the place up! 
ASTRID: Come on then. 
DOCTOR: No! Don't touch that door, it's red hot. 
ASTRID: What do you mean? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's locked. They're trying to burn through from the other side. 
ASTRID: Look! 
(Salamander's secret room is on the monitor.) 
DOCTOR: It looks like some sort of cave. 
ASTRID: It's the escape route. That's Salamander! 
DOCTOR: Yes. I wonder if he knows Kent's on his way?

[Outside the records room]

GUARD: Still no good, sir. 
BRUCE: Come on, man. Can't you increase the power? 
GUARD: Yes, sir. 
BENIK: Get back! 
(Benik takes the guard's gun and points it at Bruce, but more guards appear behind him.) 
BRUCE: About time, Forrester. 
BENIK: Don't shoot, don't shoot. 
(The guard stops trying to burn through the door.) 
BENIK: I demand a trial, Bruce, a fair trial. 
BRUCE: What a nasty little man you are, to be sure. Forrester, I want all research personnel detained, and you can begin with Benik here. Take him away. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me out there? Bruce?

[Records room]

DOCTOR: Can you hear me? 
BRUCE [OC]: Yes, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Oh, there you are. I think Kent is going to try to blow us up. Any chance of getting us out of here? Things are going to turn rather nasty in a minute. 
BRUCE [OC]: We're doing our best, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, if you can't you'd better leave with your men. There's no point in us all going up in smoke.

[Underground tunnel]

(Salamander comes out of the shadows and takes Kent's gun.) 
SALAMANDER: You always were a fool, weren't you? 
KENT: Now, wait a minute. They'll be after both of us now. 
SALAMANDER: Oh no, they won't. 
KENT: I tell you, they know! 
SALAMANDER: So what do you want me to do, huh? Bury our differences? I didn't need you once. I still don't need you. 
KENT: Now wait a minute. The place is mined, we know that. We planned it for years, together. Between us we can destroy them all, and the evidence. Just you and me, Salamander. 
SALAMANDER: You and me. What use are you to me? You were useful once, but now. 
KENT: No, no! 
(Salamander shoots Kent in the shoulder. Kent runs back down the tunnel.) 
SALAMANDER: You won't get away from me, Kent.

[Underground room]

(The Doctor and Astrid watch on the monitor as Kent is trapped.) 
SALAMANDER: I told you you could not escape me. 
(Salamander shoots Kent.) 
KENT: Well, if I'm going to die, Salamander, you'll die with me. 
(Kent pulls a control lever.) 
SALAMANDER: No! No!

[Records room]

(The explosion rocks the research station. The records room door flies open.) 
BRUCE: Come on, Doctor. Let's get out of here. 
(On the monitor a hand can be seen sticking out of the rubble.) 
ASTRID: Salamander! Giles! They're dead! 
BRUCE: We will be too if we don't get out of here. Come along.

[Outside the records room]

ASTRID: The people. 
BRUCE: People. What people? 
ASTRID: The people underground in the deep shelter. 
DOCTOR: They may have been killed. 
ASTRID: I promised Swann I'd get them out. 
BRUCE: But that's not your fault. You couldn't have done more. 
DOCTOR: There's a TV monitor screen in there. There must be a link to the deep shelter.

[Records room]

ASTRID: It's all right! They're alive! 
BRUCE: How are you going to get to them? 
ASTRID: There's a tunnel from outside. We can get to it outside the Research Station. 
BRUCE: But that's probably been destroyed by the explosion. 
ASTRID: We'll get to them somehow. 
BRUCE: Look out! 
(Some of the ceiling falls down.) 
ASTRID: Give me some men. I'll lead them. 
BRUCE: All right. I'll go with you. 
DOCTOR: Oh good, that's splendid. I'll come too. 
ASTRID: Oh no, Doctor. It's far too dangerous. They might mistake you as Salamander. 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Oh. 
ASTRID: Are you hurt? 
DOCTOR: No, I'm all right. I'll come with you as far as the gates. Come on, we must go.

[Beach]

(It is now night, and Jamie is waiting outside the Tardis.) 
JAMIE: I thought you were never coming. Hey, Doctor, are you all right? 
(The little man staggers through the open doors.)

[Tardis]

VICTORIA: Oh, there you are, Doctor. You do look in a state. Come and sit down. 
JAMIE: I told you he wouldn't be long. You worry too much. 
VICTORIA: We shouldn't have left him. 
JAMIE: You see, after the explosion, Doctor, we didnae know what to do. You said to come back here, which we did, but I'm sure we were followed. 
VICTORIA: Please, can we start straight away? 
(The Doctor is staring at the console, confused. He gestures at Jamie.) 
JAMIE: Me, Doctor? But you said we were never to touch the controls. 
DOCTOR: Quite right, Jamie. 
(The real Doctor is in the doorway.) 
DOCTOR: Welcome to the Tardis. 
SALAMANDER: Thank you. You're doing so well impersonating me, I thought I might return the compliment. 
DOCTOR: And Giles Kent? 
SALAMANDER: Unfortunately, didn't survive the explosion. 
DOCTOR: We're going to put you outside, Salamander. No friends, no safety, nothing. You'll run, but they'll catch up with you. 
SALAMANDER: No! 
(Salamander pins the Doctor against the console.) 
SALAMANDER: And now I'm going to kill you. 
JAMIE: No, you don't. 
(The three men struggle against the console and the Tardis dematerialises while the doors are still open.) 
VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Victoria! Jamie! Hold onto something! 
(The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria lie on the floor holding hands and hang on to a chair.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
(Salamander can't get a hold of anything, and is sucked out into the void of time and space as the Tardis whirls away.)

[Tardis]

(The Doctor's evil double, Salamander, has been sucked out of the Tardis while it is in flight. The Doctor and Victoria are hanging on to the console base.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie! Jamie! The doors! We've got to close the doors! Can you do it? 
(Jamie is hanging onto a wall roundel on the opposite wall to the doors.) 
JAMIE: I'll try, Doctor, but I'll have to get to a better position. 
DOCTOR: That's it, Victoria. Hold on. Whatever you do, hold on! 
VICTORIA: I'm slipping! 
DOCTOR: No, no, you're not. I've got hold of you. Don't look out there. Concentrate on holding on. 
VICTORIA: I can't! 
DOCTOR: Yes, you can. That's the style. 
JAMIE: Right, Doctor, I'm going to try and fall to the control panel. 
DOCTOR: All right, but watch the Tardis doesn't lurch again. 
(Jamie falls backwards onto the console.) 
JAMIE: Made it. 
DOCTOR: Well done. 
JAMIE: So far, so good. 
DOCTOR: You know the switch? 
JAMIE: Aye. Found it. I'm nearly there. 
(Jamie reaches for the lever, then falls. He grabs on to the Doctor's coat before he slides down towards the doors.) 
DOCTOR: It's all right, they're closing! 
(The Tardis doors shut tight.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, well done, Jamie. You did it! That was a near thing, wasn't it? Are you all right, Victoria? 
VICTORIA: Oh, what happened? Are we safe now? 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I think so. Salamander started the Tardis without first closing the door. He was sucked out. 
JAMIE: Aye, and I nearly joined him. 
DOCTOR: I'm very glad you didn't. He's not in a very enviable position, you know, at the moment, floating around in time and space. Now then, where shall we go? 
JAMIE: Oh, let's just get our breath back first before you start tearing off anywhere. Anyway, as you know the Tardis has a mind of its own. You know you can't control it. 
DOCTOR: Can't control it? 
JAMIE: No. 
DOCTOR: We'll see about that. We'll see about that. 
VICTORIA: Here we go again. 
JAMIE: I wonder where it'll be this time. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I wonder.

[Museum]

(It's an Abominable Snowman, and it is being looked at by a grey-bearded Travers. A door opens.) 
ANNE [OC]: Mister Silverstein? 
SILVERSTEIN [OC]: Yes. Who are you? 
ANNE [OC]: Anne Travers. Is my father here? 
SILVERSTEIN [OC]: Yes, he's here Come and see him, and take him away. He's a fool, an old fool. 
(Other exhibits in the room include a baby giraffe.) 
ANNE: Father? Father. 
TRAVERS: Anne, what are you doing here? 
ANNE: Looking for you. 
TRAVERS: Oh? 
ANNE: You were supposed to be meeting me. 
TRAVERS: Was I? 
ANNE: At the airport. Father, what is the matter? You send me a cable saying you're in grave trouble, and I have flown half the way around the world 
TRAVERS: Trouble. Yes, a great deal of trouble. And it's that thing! 
ANNE: The Yeti? 
TRAVERS: You're a stupid old fool, Julius Silverstein. 
SILVERSTEIN: Oh, me the fool? You would like me to be the fool and give you back my Yeti, huh? 
TRAVERS: Well, you must, man. Don't you understand? It's dangerous. 
SILVERSTEIN: Huh! For thirty years it stands here in my museum, and now he tells me it is dangerous. 
TRAVERS: I wish I'd never brought it back from Tibet. 
ANNE: Father, what has happened? 
TRAVERS: Well, he won't listen to me. This silly old goat won't listen to me. I've told him, warned him. Damn it, he knows it's a robot. 
ANNE: But Father, the Yeti isn't dangerous. It can't work unless it has a control unit. 
TRAVERS: But I've done it, Anne! I have reactivated a control unit. 
ANNE: Oh, but Father, this is wonderful news. 
TRAVERS: Is it? Yes, yes, I suppose it would be, except for one thing. 
ANNE: What? 
TRAVERS: The sphere. It's gone. It's disappeared! Look, you must let me have the Yeti back, Julius. Oh, make him understand, Anne. 
SILVERSTEIN: Oh, I understand. I buy the Yeti off you thirty years ago, and now it is valuable. You try to scare me, take your Yeti back. Why? Money! You want to rob me. 
TRAVERS: All right then, I'll buy the thing back if that's what you want! 
SILVERSTEIN: No, no, no. It's priceless. The only one in the world, and it is mine. 
TRAVERS: You fool. 
SILVERSTEIN: Thief! 
TRAVERS: I'm not a thief. 
SILVERSTEIN: Swindler! 
TRAVERS: Stubborn old goat! 
ANNE: Father! 
SILVERSTEIN: Take him away. Out of my house. 
ANNE: Father, look, perhaps you've made a mistake. You've put the sphere away somewhere in your laboratory and forgotten it. You've done it before, you know. 
TRAVERS: No, I've looked everywhere. 
ANNE: Well, let's go home and look again, shall we? You know what you're like. 
TRAVERS: Yes, but suppose 
ANNE: Let's go and have a quiet dinner and you can tell me all about it. Then we'll go home and we'll look for the sphere. 
TRAVERS: All right. But I warned you, Julius, I warned you. 
SILVERSTEIN: Get out! Take him away! Nobody destroys Julius Silverstein's collection. Nobody! 
ANNE: Come on, Father. 
SILVERSTEIN: Nobody. The Yeti's mine. You can't scare me with your mad stories. Out, out, out! 
(They leave the room. A silver sphere hovers in a window, beeping to itself. It drops out of sight as Silverstein returns to blow out the candles that illuminate his private collection. Then suddenly the sphere smashes through the windowpane. Silverstein goes to investigate.) 
SILVERSTEIN: Travers? Travers, is that you? I am not frightened by your stupid tricks. Travers? I know it's you, I'm not a fool! 
(Silverstein comes round the corner and hears the beeping. The Yeti's eyes light up and it attacks the little old German Jew.)

[Tardis]

JAMIE: I tell you it did. It was flashing. 
(The Doctor is eating a sandwich.) 
DOCTOR: Now, Jamie, if that light had come on, we'd have landed, wouldn't we? 
JAMIE: Look, I'm not arguing about that. 
DOCTOR: But we're still travelling, aren't we? So how could it have done? 
JAMIE: Look, I don't know. All I know is that thing came on. Now I've not taken to seeing things. At least I don't think I have. 
(Victoria enters in a new Pocahontas style mini-dress, with her hair in plaits.) 
VICTORIA: Hey, do you like it? 
DOCTOR: What? 
VICTORIA: I found it in the chest. I think it looks very sophisticated, don't you? 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, very sophisticated, Victoria. Go on, Jamie. Don't you? 
JAMIE: Aye. Now look, I'm not daft you know, Doctor. 
VICTORIA: Doctor? 
DOCTOR: What? 
VICTORIA: Why is that light flashing? 
JAMIE: Aha! 
DOCTOR: I see. Are you two playing some sort of game? 
JAMIE: There you are. Told you so. 
DOCTOR: Well, then we are landing, aren't we? 
(The Tardis dematerialises.) 
VICTORIA: Let's hope it's somewhere pleasant. 
JAMIE: Hey, it might even be Scotland. 
DOCTOR: Now shush. The scanner, that will tell us. 
VICTORIA: Where are we? 
JAMIE: Nothing but stars. What does it mean? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. Something strange has happened. We're suspended in space 
(Not just suspended, but being rapidly covered in cobwebs.) 
DOCTOR: Gravity? 
JAMIE: On. 
DOCTOR: Power? 
VICTORIA: On. 
DOCTOR: Control? 
JAMIE: Er, on. 
DOCTOR: Flight. 
VICTORIA: That's on too. 
DOCTOR: There you are, you see? I was right. It is all working. 
JAMIE: You mean we've landed and yet we haven't landed? 
VICTORIA: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Just a minute, Victoria. If the time lock has slipped 
VICTORIA: Doctor, look at the scanner! 
(The view is being covered by cobwebs.) 
JAMIE: What is that stuff, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. But something or someone is holding us here.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

(An army corporal is talking into a telephone.) 
LANE: Hello? Hello? Hello? 
(Another soldier, in fatigues, enters.) 
BLAKE: Know where the Captain is? 
LANE: Yeah, he's upstairs, being chatted up by that TV bloke.

[Goodge Street Common room]

(There's a darts board on the wall. The interview is being put onto audio tape by a smarmy man in a bow-tie.) 
CHORLEY: And finally, Captain Knight, could you tell us your own feelings about Colonel Pemberton? 
KNIGHT: Well, he was certainly a brave soldier. There's no doubt about that. He gave his life for his country, and I was proud to serve under him. Is that all right? 
CHORLEY: Oh, super. Sterling stuff! You talk in pure quotes, old boy. 
KNIGHT: Not just quotes, Mister Chorley. I meant what I said. 
(The Corporal enters and salutes.) 
BLAKE: Professor Travers is here, sir. 
TRAVERS: What the devil's going on? Why have I been brought here like this? Who are you? 
KNIGHT: Knight 
TRAVERS: Never heard of you. Who? 
KNIGHT: Captain Knight. OK, Corporal. 
(The Corporal leaves.) 
KNIGHT: Look, it's no good shouting at me, Professor. I didn't ask for you. 
TRAVERS: Who did, then? 
KNIGHT: Your daughter. 
TRAVERS: Anne? Just like her mother. Always interfering in things she knows nothing about. 
KNIGHT: I understood that you'd sent for her to come back from America and help you. 
TRAVERS: What do you want me for, anyway? 
KNIGHT: I don't. I consider this to be a military matter. Others disagree. 
TRAVERS: Well, you haven't had much success so far, have you? 
(Knight leaves.) 
TRAVERS: Army. What the devil do they know about it? Who are you? 
CHORLEY: Harold Chorley, London Television. 
TRAVERS: Who? What? 
CHORLEY: Harold Chorley, London Television. 
TRAVERS: Television? Never watch it. You an actor or something? 
CHORLEY: Journalist, actually. The government, in its infinite wisdom, decided only to allow one correspondent down here. The press chose me. 
TRAVERS: Oh yes? 
CHORLEY: Tell me, Professor, will you be in charge of the scientific section, or will your daughter? 
TRAVERS: Mind your own business! 
CHORLEY: And how long do you think it's going to take you to come up with the answer? One week? Three, perhaps? 
TRAVERS: Well how the hell should I know? Is that thing working? 
CHORLEY: Of course. 
TRAVERS: It's more than likely we won't be able to defeat this menace. London, in fact the whole of England, might be completely wiped out. There, did you get that?

[Tardis]

(The Doctor is sitting on the floor working on a control box. Victoria is sitting next to him. Jamie hands over a component.)
JAMIE: That's the only one I could find. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh yes, that'll do, Jamie, I think. Just get that in there and that'll be excellent. There we are, that should work. 
(The Doctor hands the box up to Jamie.) 
JAMIE: What does it do? 
DOCTOR: Oh, nothing. 
JAMIE: Oh, no. 
DOCTOR: Well, nothing yet, but it will do once we start moving again. 
(Jamie drops the box and the Doctor catches it.) 
VICTORIA: Do you think we ever will? We've been here so long. 
DOCTOR: Yes, of course we will, Victoria. You see, whatever's holding us must let go sometime. 
JAMIE: Doctor, the scanner. It's clearing! 
(The cobwebs disappear.) 
VICTORIA: The scanner's cleared! 
DOCTOR: Right. Now Jamie, give me a hand while there's still time. Plug this in. 
JAMIE: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Plug it in there. Yes, that's right. Now listen, both of you. As soon as we land, whatever you do, don't let go. Hold on. 
(The box is attached to the console.) 
VICTORIA: What's going to happen? We're landing 
DOCTOR: There. Now, hold tight 
(There is a piercing noise.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, it's not so bad as I thought. 
(There's a big jolt, and everyone falls down.) 
DOCTOR: Is everyone all right? 
JAMIE: Aye. What did you do? 
DOCTOR: Well, I've managed to move us on a bit. Not very far, perhaps half a mile from where we were expected to land. For the moment, we have eluded our captor. Look at the scanner, both of you. 
(It is a rounded tunnel lined with dressed stone and lit in places.) 
VICTORIA: Well, where are we? 
DOCTOR: I really don't know, Victoria. Shall we go out and have a look? 
VICTORIA: Now, is it safe? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I shouldn't think so for a moment. Jamie, I think we're going to need torches.

[Covent Garden Underground station]

(The Doctor, Victoria and Jamie come out of the Tardis, which is parked by metal security gates. The walls are tiled. There is a large metal boxed conduit above.) 
DOCTOR: Some sort of grille. 
JAMIE: Don't say you've landed us in a prison. 
DOCTOR: It could be the dungeons of a castle. 
VICTORIA: It's so dark. 
DOCTOR: Ah, steps. Come along, be careful. 
(They go down a staircase.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, it seems to be a large room. Tiled walls, curved ceiling. Come on.

[Covent Garden Underground platform]

JAMIE: The floor seems to end here. Hey, there's a sort of trench. Look. 
VICTORIA: Hey, Doctor. Come and look at this. 
DOCTOR: What have you found, Victoria? 
VICTORIA: See for yourself. 
(The Doctor shines his torch on the wall.) 
DOCTOR: Covent Garden. Oh yes, of course. It's an underground station. We're standing on the platform. 
VICTORIA: Underground station? 
DOCTOR: Trains. Underground trains. A little after your time, I think, Victoria. 
VICTORIA: Is it always as dark as this? 
DOCTOR: No, no, no. It's probably the middle of the night. Come along, let's go up top. There'll be lots of light up there. Funny, isn't it? 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: How we keep landing on your Earth!

[Covent Garden Ticket hall]

(The street exit has a metal gate across it.) 
VICTORIA: Oh, the Doctor was wrong. 
JAMIE: Aye, it's not the middle of the night, it's broad daylight. 
DOCTOR: Just a minute. Just let me get my breath. Those stairs. 
JAMIE: It looks like we're locked in, though. 
DOCTOR: Well, that's strange. 
VICTORIA: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes? 
VICTORIA: Listen. 
JAMIE: I can't here anything. 
DOCTOR: Oh, it is quiet. I see what you mean. The middle of London, there should be some noise. 
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, there's an old man over there. Let's ask him. 
DOCTOR: Yes, go on. 
JAMIE: Excuse me. Excuse me. 
(Jamie reaches through the gate to touch the man leaning against it. The cobweb covered figure slides sideways to the ground, revealing a newspaper banner proclaiming 'Londoners flee! Menace spreads'.)

[Covent Garden Underground platform]

DOCTOR: It's all right, it's all right. 
VICTORIA: Oh but Doctor, did you see his face? It was sort of covered with cobwebs. 
JAMIE: Like that stuff we saw on the scanner. 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Now, come along. 
VICTORIA: Oh, no, no, don't let's go into the tunnel, please. 
DOCTOR: But we've got to get above ground, Victoria. Now let's try the next station. Come along. 
JAMIE: Aye, come on. 
(Jamie jumps down into the 'trench'.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, no! Don't move! Don't touch the rails. 
JAMIE: What's the matter? 
DOCTOR: Whatever you do, stand still! Stand still. Don't move. Keep quite still, Jamie. 
(The Doctor holds a small meter over the rails.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, it's all right. You can relax. The electricity is off. 
JAMIE: What was all that about? 
DOCTOR: If there had been a current running through these rails, you'd have been fried! 
JAMIE: Hey? 
DOCTOR: Electrified. Brunched! Burnt up! Now, come along. It's safe now, I think, but we'd better be careful. Follow me

[Tunnel]

(The Doctor bends down to touch the rails.) 
VICTORIA: What are you doing, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Just confirming something. Yes, just as I thought. There haven't been any trains here for some time. 
JAMIE: Hey, what's that over there? 
DOCTOR: It's a power cable. I wonder what it's doing down here? 
(A row of overhead lights comes on.) 
DOCTOR: In there, quick. 
(They hide in a maintenance men's alcove. Three soldiers approach. The sergeant is carrying a rifle at the ready and the other two a drum of cable which is unwinding as they walk past the alcove and on towards Covent Garden.) 
DOCTOR: Soldiers? I wonder what they're doing down here? 
JAMIE: Let's go and ask them. 
DOCTOR: No. I think we'd better tread carefully. Let's go and find out what's going on first. 
(They follow the soldiers a short way.) 
VICTORIA: What do you want us to do, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: You follow the soldiers, but keep out of sight. I'm going to see where this cable goes to. Meet back here in a few minutes, all right? 
JAMIE: Right. 
(The Doctor heads back up the tunnel. Further along, the soldiers stop.) 
BLAKE: (a corporal) What's the matter? 
WEAMS: Thought I heard something. 
ARNOLD: (the sergeant) Getting a bit jumpy, aren't you, Weams? 
WEAMS: It's no wonder, is it, Staff? 
BLAKE: Shall we connect up the new drum now, Staff? 
ARNOLD: Yeah. All right, Corporal. 
BLAKE: Good thing we fixed these lights. 
WEAMS: You can say that again. 
(A little way back.) 
JAMIE: I can't hear anything. 
VICTORIA: Are they still there? 
JAMIE: I think they must be moving. Come on. 
(Victoria walks into a cobweb and squeals.) 
WEAMS: I told you I heard something, didn't I, Staff? 
ARNOLD: Yeah. Come on. 
VICTORIA: I'm sorry! 
JAMIE: It's only a cobweb. 
VICTORIA: Oh, do you think they heard? 
JAMIE: Hope not. Come on. 
(But they are ambushed at the next maintenance alcove.) 
ARNOLD: Well, well, well, would you believe it? The babes in the wood.

[Charing Cross Underground platform]

(The Doctor has followed the cable to another platform and into a pile of crates, labelled Explosives. There is a beeping sound which he recognises, and he hides by the rails under the platform as a Yeti enters.)

[Goodge Street Ops room]

LANE: It's no good. I can't raise them, sir. 
KNIGHT: The truck was due there twenty minutes ago. 
LANE: I wouldn't worry, sir. We've never had any trouble at Holborn before. They're probably on their way back by now. 
KNIGHT: Yes, perhaps you're right, Corporal Lane. Keep trying Holborn. 
LANE: Sir. 
(Anne Travers enters.) 
KNIGHT: Oh, hello. 
ANNE: This blast recorder's working now, Captain. 
KNIGHT: Fine. Let me give you a hand. 
ANNE: It's quite all right, I can manage. 
KNIGHT: No, no, I insist. Come on. 
(Chorley enters.) 
CHORLEY: Now look here, Knight. I really must protest. 
KNIGHT: What's the matter now, Mister Chorley? 
CHORLEY: Professor Travers! He's being obstructive and secretive. Now I was led to believe that when I came here, I was going to be given full facilities. Look, perhaps you can help, Miss Travers? 
ANNE: I really am very busy, Mister Chorley. 
CHORLEY: But so am I. 
KNIGHT: There's not time for talking, Chorley. Travers is busy. Now don't worry, I'll see that you're not left in the dark. 
(Anne smiles as Knight bustles Chorley out of the room.) 
(Meanwhile at Charing Cross, two Yetis are on the platform. They use a cobweb gun to smother the crates of explosives.)

[Goodge Street Fortress]

ARNOLD: All right, you two, stand over there. Keep an eye on them, Blake, will you? 
(Another soldier enters.) 
ARNOLD: Hey, you there. Give the craftsman a hand. 
SOLDIER: Oh, but Staff, I'm on this other job. 
ARNOLD: Don't argue, lad. Just get on with it. I want that in the Operations Room upstairs. 
(Weams and the soldier carry the cable drum up the staircase.)

[Goodge Street Ops room]

(Anne and Lane are working on pieces of equipment.) 
KNIGHT: How's it going? 
ANNE: Just fine. 
KNIGHT: What's a girl like you doing in a job like this? 
ANNE: Well, when I was a little girl I thought I'd like to be a scientist, so I became a scientist. 
KNIGHT: Just like that? 
ANNE: Just like that. 
(Arnold enters.) 
KNIGHT: Been a long time, Staff. Everything all right? 
ARNOLD: Yes, all right, sir. Weams is just struggling up with the cable now. Come on, you two, chop chop. 
WEAMS: In here, mate. Come on. 
KNIGHT: Any trouble at Charing Cross? 
ARNOLD: No trouble, sir. All right, lads, you can buzz off now. By the way, I brought you back a little present, sir. 
KNIGHT: Oh? 
ARNOLD: Found a couple of youngsters loose in the tunnel. 
KNIGHT: What the devil were they doing down there? 
ARNOLD: I don't know, sir. I thought perhaps you'd better chat them up, so I brought them back here. 
KNIGHT: Put them in the Common Room, Staff. I can't talk to them now. I don't want to waste any more time on this demolition job. 
ARNOLD: Sir. 
ANNE: Staff Sergeant. 
ARNOLD: Yes, miss. 
ANNE: You're sure there are only two of them down there? 
ARNOLD: Yes, miss. Why? 
ANNE: Well, I don't like the idea of the tunnel being blown up if there's anybody else down there. 
ARNOLD: I see what you mean, miss. 
KNIGHT: Make sure there's no one else down there. Have a word with them, Staff. I want that tunnel blown as soon as possible.

[Goodge Street Fortress]

JAMIE: How much longer are we going to be kept here? 
BLAKE: What's the matter then. Don't you like it here? 
VICTORIA: No, I don't. Where are we, anyway? 
(Arnold enters.) 
ARNOLD: All right, Blake. I'll take over now. 
BLAKE: Right-ho, Staff. 
ARNOLD: You two, in here.

[Goodge Street Common room]

JAMIE: Do you mind telling us where we are? 
ARNOLD: Oh, this place has been here a long time. It were a transit camp in the Second World War. 
JAMIE: What do you do down here? 
ARNOLD: Now, now, everybody knows what's happening. And you know very well you shouldn't have come down here. By the way, you were on your own, weren't you? 
VICTORIA: Well 
JAMIE: Yes. 
(At Charing Cross, the Yeti leave and the Doctor comes out of hiding.) 
ARNOLD: You're quite sure there was nobody with you? 
JAMIE: Look, how many more times? 
ARNOLD: Well, that's all right then. 
(Knight enters.) 
KNIGHT: Clear to fire, Staff? 
ARNOLD: Yes, sir. They were on their own apparently. 
KNIGHT: Right. 
(Knight leaves.) 
JAMIE: What was all that about? 
ARNOLD: I suppose there's no harm in telling you. You know, you two are very lucky. We're going to blow up the tunnel. 
JAMIE: What? 
ARNOLD: That's what we were laying the cable for. 
VICTORIA: The Doctor!

[Goodge Street Ops room]

(Knight enters.) 
KNIGHT: It's all right, they were on their own. Okay, Weams, no sense in wasting any more time. Off you go. 
WEAMS: Right, sir. 
(Weams flips a couple of switches and presses a button. In Charing Cross, the web-covered crates flare bright white and go boom as the Doctor is thrown away from them.)

Episode Two

[Goodge Street Common room]

(Jamie and Victoria have been locked in.) 
JAMIE: Come on, let us out! Let us out! 
VICTORIA: It's no good, Jamie. They can't hear. What have we done? 
JAMIE: Not we, Victoria. Me. I'm the one that's to blame. I should have told them about the Doctor.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

KNIGHT: A doctor? Well, if he was anywhere near those explosives when they went up. 
ARNOLD: Yes, sir. Don't you think I should go and have a look, sir? The youngsters said he was following the cable. 
KNIGHT: Yes, you'd better. 
ARNOLD: Sir. 
KNIGHT: Oh, and Staff, take someone with you. 
ARNOLD: Sir. 
(Arnold leaves.) 
WEAMS: Sir? 
KNIGHT: Yes, Weams? 
WEAMS: This blast recorder ain't working, sir. 
KNIGHT: Rubbish. Miss Travers checked it. 
WEAMS: Well, it ain't registered, sir. 
ANNE: He's right. 
KNIGHT: But it fired. Look at the circuits. You can't have an explosion without a blast, can you? 
WEAMS: No, sir. 
ANNE: Well, come to think of it, we didn't hear anything either. We should have heard something, even at this distance. 
KNIGHT: Yes. 
WEAMS: Sir, this Doctor bloke who's in the tunnel. He could have tampered with the charges, you know. 
KNIGHT: Sabotage. I think it's time we had a chat with those two youngsters.

[Goodge Street Common room]

VICTORIA: You mustn't blame yourself, Jamie. After all, the Doctor did tell us to be careful. Now we still don't know who these people are. 
JAMIE: No, we don't know anything, except the Doctor might have been blown to kingdom come. 
(Knight enters.) 
VICTORIA: The Doctor, is he? 
KNIGHT: Sit down, both of you. 
(Anne and Chorley enter.) 
VICTORIA: Is it bad news, then? 
ANNE: Oh, no. Well, at least, we hope not. 
KNIGHT: We don't know for the moment. I've sent a couple of men along the tunnel to investigate. But that's not why I came in here. You three are up to something, and I mean to find out what. 
JAMIE: We're up to something? Now just a moment. Suppose you tell us first just what's going on down here. 
CHORLEY: How did you get into the tunnel? Or let me put it another way. Where did you break in? 
VICTORIA: We didn't break in. 
CHORLEY: But you must have done. All the stations are sealed, aren't they? 
VICTORIA: We just arrived. We were brought here. 
WEAMS: Sir, Lane's got Holborn on the line. Sounds like trouble. 
KNIGHT: Yeti? 
WEAMS: Could be, sir. Something's up. 
KNIGHT: Okay, Weams. 
(Knight leaves with Weams and Chorley.) 
JAMIE: Yeti? Did he say Yeti?

[Goodge Street Ops room]

LANE: Hello? Hello, Holborn? This is HQ to Holborn. Can you hear me? Not a sausage. 
O'BRIEN: There must be someone manning the phone. 
(Knight, Weams and Chorley enter.) 
KNIGHT: Okay, Lane, what gives? 
LANE: Well, it's just firing at the other end, sir. 
KNIGHT: Firing? 
LANE: Yes, sir. Listen. 
(Sounds of weapons fire, a voice then a scream and silence.)  
CHORLEY: Great stuff. 
LANE: Hello, HQ to Holborn? 
KNIGHT: What happened, Lane? 
LANE: Well, it was difficult to hear, sir. I think the truck was late getting there 
KNIGHT: Then what? 
WEAMS: Well, they must have got the ammo unloaded, sir, because he says they were jumped when they were moving. 
KNIGHT: Take O'Brien and a couple of the others. 
LANE: Sir. Come on, mate. 
(Lane and O'Brien leave.) 
CHORLEY: Here, you're not going out there? 
KNIGHT: Yes, Mister Chorley. Want to come? Report some action first hand? 
CHORLEY: Well, I don't think I'd better get in the way. I, er, I think I'd better stay here, don't you? 
KNIGHT: Yes. Yes, I think you better had.

[Charing Cross Underground platform]

(The crates have been destroyed inside their cobweb cocoon.) 
BLAKE: There hasn't been an explosion, Staff. 
ARNOLD: I can see that, lad. Here. 
BLAKE: No sign of that Doctor bloke. 
ARNOLD: No. Here, what do you make of this? 
BLAKE: It's our detonator, all right. It's fired, too. Here, hang on a minute. All the ammo, Staff. If it's fired, then why didn't 
ARNOLD: Yeah, why isn't this tunnel blocked? No damage at all. Yet something blew up here. 
BLAKE: It's obvious, innit? It's been got at. 
ARNOLD: Where's that Doctor? That's what I'd like to know.

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

(Professor Travers is at his work bench, examining internal circuitry of a Yeti control sphere.) 
ANNE: Father? 
TRAVERS: Hmm? 
ANNE: The soldiers have found two youngsters in the tunnels. They seem to know a great deal about the Yeti. 
TRAVERS: Oh? 
ANNE: They know they're robots. 
TRAVERS: What? 
ANNE: They know about the control spheres, too. 
TRAVERS: But they can't have. I mean, the public were never told. 
ANNE: I know. 
TRAVERS: Where are they?

[Goodge Street Common room]

JAMIE: Don't you see it makes sense, Victoria. If the Yeti are in London, then the Intelligence is here too. 
VICTORIA: What, you mean controlling them? 
JAMIE: Aye, and not only them. Look, it must have been the Intelligence that got hold of us in space, and it must have brought us here. 
VICTORIA: Oh, but why? 
JAMIE: I wish I knew. Revenge, perhaps. 
(Travers and Anne enter.) 
TRAVERS: Well now, you've got some explaining to do, haven't you? 
JAMIE: We have? Now look here. 
TRAVERS: Now, now, just what do you know about the Yeti? 
JAMIE: Quite a lot, but before we go into all 
TRAVERS: And the spheres? Where'd you find out about them? 
JAMIE: That's none of your business. I'd just like to 
TRAVERS: Who are you? 
JAMIE: I'd like to ask you the same question. 
VICTORIA: Wait a minute, Jamie! I'm Victoria Waterfield. And that's Jamie McCrimmon! 
ANNE: Father? 
TRAVERS: But it can't be. Why, that's over forty years ago. 
JAMIE: What's going on here? 
VICTORIA: Oh Jamie, don't you recognise him? It's Professor Travers. 
JAMIE: So it is! Professor Travers! Here, hasn't he got old? Oh, but we're very pleased to see you, Professor. Very pleased. 
TRAVERS: The time machine. It was all true then? 
JAMIE: The Tardis you mean? Aye, of course it's true. Hey, do you know what's happened to the Doctor? 
VICTORIA: Oh, is he safe? 
TRAVERS: Isn't he with you? 
ANNE: No, he's in the tunnels. Arnold's gone to look for him. Father, what is going on? 
TRAVERS: Oh dear, I do hope he's all right. Come on, Jamie. Let's go and find out if he's got back yet. 
ANNE: Father! 
TRAVERS: Eh? Victoria, try and explain to Anne, will you? It's all right, Victoria. You were born. I mean. She was born years before I was! 
(Travers and Jamie leave.) 
ANNE: A time machine. 
VICTORIA: Oh, dear.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

ARNOLD: And the Captain's been gone about twenty minutes, you say? 
WEAMS: Yes, Staff. 
CHORLEY: Must have been quite a battle. I should think we've lost those chaps bringing back the ammo. 
ARNOLD: Well it's to be hoped you're wrong, Mister Chorley. All right, Blake, you can stand down now. You too, Weams. 
WEAMS: Right-ho, Staff. 
(Jamie and Travers enter.) 
JAMIE: Ah, Sergeant. The Doctor, is he all right? 
ARNOLD: He weren't killed in the explosion, if that's what you mean. 
TRAVERS: Oh, thank heavens. 
ARNOLD: For the simple reason that there weren't no explosion. 
TRAVERS: What? 
ARNOLD: Somebody had tampered with it, and it's my guess it was this Doctor feller. 
TRAVERS: What rot, Arnold. The Doctor's a friend of mine. He's the one man that can help us. 
ARNOLD: Oh is he now? Well, he weren't nowhere to be seen. He'd disappeared. 
JAMIE: Do you think the Yeti got him? 
ARNOLD: No. 
JAMIE: What makes you so sure? 
ARNOLD: Dunno. Just a hunch. Hey, wait a minute, where d'you think you're going? 
JAMIE: He may be lying injured. 
ARNOLD: No, we'd have found him. Unless you know where he is? 
JAMIE: I might. 
ARNOLD: Take me to him, could you? 
JAMIE: Aye. 
ARNOLD: Right, well come on, lad.

[Goodge Street Common room]

ANNE: It flies? Through time and space? 
VICTORIA: Not exactly flies. Well, it's difficult to explain. 
ANNE: Not half as difficult as it is to believe. 
VICTORIA: Your father believes it. 
ANNE: Yes. Yes, he seems to. And you met him, when was it you said? In 1935? In Tibet? 
VICTORIA: Yes. 
ANNE: You couldn't possibly have. You're no older than. But you seem to know about the Tibet business. Why didn't my father tell anyone about this Doctor friend of yours and his Tardis? 
VICTORIA: You're his daughter, and even you find it difficult to believe. So how would other people react? 
(Chorley enters.) 
CHORLEY: Ah, sorry to barge in. Left my typewriter in here, and I want to knock up a quick piece about this mysterious Doctor chap. Hey, a bit of a turn-up for the book, wasn't it? Any theories? 
ANNE: On what? 
CHORLEY: On what the Doctor and these two kids were doing in the tunnel. 
ANNE: Mushrooming? 
CHORLEY: No, seriously. 
ANNE: Ask a silly question. 
CHORLEY: Hasn't she told you anything? 
ANNE: Nothing that you could print, Mister Chorley. 
CHORLEY: Oh, for goodness sake, why is everybody being so evasive? Why won't anybody answer any questions? 
ANNE: Perhaps they're afraid you'll interpret them in your own inimitable style. 
CHORLEY: And what does that mean, pray? 
ANNE: It means you have a reputation for distorting the truth. You take reality and you make it into a comic strip. In short, Mister Chorley, you are a sensationaliser. 
CHORLEY: You smug little redbrick university 
ANNE: Don't say it, Mister Chorley. I have a very quick temper and very long claws. 
CHORLEY: There's no sense in us losing our temper, Miss Travers. I'm sorry that my journalistic style doesn't appeal to you, but there are millions of people it does. 
ANNE: Yes, the gutter press has a very large following. 
CHORLEY: Yes, it does. It does indeed. And you'd do very well to remember that, because I intend to print all the facts when we get out of here. 
ANNE: If we get out of here. The Yeti, remember? 
CHORLEY: I'm not forgetting. In fact, I think our little friend here could tell us a few things about them. It was quite a coincidence, wasn't it, you three pitching up when you did. 
VICTORIA: What do you mean? 
CHORLEY: Ah, don't give us the innocent bit, love. You know very well that the Doctor sabotaged that explosion. 
ANNE: Mister Chorley, what are you talking about? 
CHORLEY: Arnold's just come back and confirmed there was no explosion in the tunnel, and the only person who was in there, as far as we know, was your Doctor friend. 
VICTORIA: If the Doctor did stop it, he had a very good reason. 
CHORLEY: Yes, well we'll find out soon enough, because Arnold's just taken the lad back in to hunt him out. 
VICTORIA: Jamie's gone into the tunnel?

[Tunnel]

(Captain Knight and a party of soldiers have salvaged some supplies from Holborn. On their way back they are attacked by Yeti. Lane leads a rearguard action as Knight supervises construction of a barricade of ammunition crates across the tunnel.) 
KNIGHT: Right, Thompson, that's the best we can do. Now go and tell the Corporal to get the men back here as fast as he can. 
(Gunshots.) 
KNIGHT: No. No, you're too late. Stay where you are. Lane! Lane! Fall back! You'll never hold them! 
(Further along the tunnel, Lane and two soldiers are firing at two Yeti. The bullets have no effect.) 
Lane: Will nothing stop them? 
(One soldier falls, and the Yeti kill him.) 
LANE: Come on, back! 
(Lane and O'Brien retreat, firing.) 
LANE: Right, come on! 
(O'Brien's rifle jams, so he uses it as a club. The Yeti knock him down and use their web guns on him. Lane fires and runs back to the barricade.) 
LANE: We couldn't hold them, sir. They're coming, two of them! They got O'Brien and Cocksey. Nothing stops them. 
(There's a voice behind them.) 
LANE: It's Staff Arnold. 
KNIGHT: Yeah, come on. 
(Knight and Lane go back to Arnold and Jamie.) 
ARNOLD: Captain? 
KNIGHT: Yeti. 
LANE: They got two of us. 
KNIGHT: And the ammo detail. They're all gone. 
ARNOLD: What's the plan then? 
KNIGHT: I brought a load of explosives down from Holborn. I'm going to blow it and them with it. 
ARNOLD: Taking a bit of a risk, aren't you, sir? 
KNIGHT: Yeah, I know. 
JAMIE: Hey, look. What's happening? 
(The Yeti are using their web guns on the barricade.) 
LANE: What are they doing? 
JAMIE: Looks like the cobwebs. 
KNIGHT: Cobwebs or not, I'm going to blow it sky high. Get back! 
(Knight aims his rifle at the barricade and fires. There is the sound of an explosion and a blinding light.) 
LANE: What's that noise? 
JAMIE: The boxes are pulsating! 
(The cobweb has absorbed the blast. The Yeti are untouched.) 
KNIGHT: Get back! 
(But there are two more Yeti approaching from their rear.)

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

TRAVERS: Chorley's an idiot, telling Victoria the boy's gone. Those two are all that child's got in the world. 
ANNE: I asked her to make some tea. Thought it would take her mind off things. 
TRAVERS: Oh, good idea. Oh, switch the soldering iron on, would you? 
ANNE: Father? Have you ever seen this Tardis? 
TRAVERS: No, no, I can't say I have. 
(Victoria is outside the door, and overhears them.) 
ANNE: It all sounds a bit far-fetched to me. You know, I think the Doctor's at the back of all this. 
TRAVERS: What do you mean? 
ANNE: Doesn't it strike you as odd that on the two occasions you've encountered the Yeti, you've also come across the Doctor? 
TRAVERS: Well? 
ANNE: Well, it's obvious. He controls them! 
TRAVERS: Oh, but surely. What? Oh, tea. Thank you, my dear. 
(Victoria has entered.) 
TRAVERS: Oh, aren't you having any? 
VICTORIA: No. I think I'll go and lie down for a bit. 
TRAVERS: Yes, good idea. 
(Victoria leaves.) 
ANNE: Do you think she heard? 
TRAVERS: No. In any case, what you say is nonsense, Anne. I saw the Doctor defeat those robots and save Detsen Monastery. He wouldn't do that if he was in league with them, now would he? 
ANNE: No, no, I suppose not. In a situation like this one imagines all sorts of things.

[Tunnel]

THOMPSON: This waiting's getting on my nerves. Why the heck don't they do something? 
ARNOLD: Steady, lad. We'll know soon enough. 
THOMPSON: We can't just stand here. Can't we make a run for it? 
JAMIE: We wouldn't stand a chance, not with them switched on. 
KNIGHT: How do you know that? 
ARNOLD: It's all right, sir. The Professor's vouched for him. Understand he knows a great deal about these robots. 
JAMIE: See, you have to find out. (beeping sound) What's that? 
(The Yeti leave.) 
THOMPSON: They've left us behind. 
KNIGHT: What made them do that, I wonder? 
ARNOLD: Couldn't say, sir. But I don't think we should stay to find out. 
KNIGHT: Yes, you're right, Staff. Come on. Let's get back. 
JAMIE: Wait. Can we not just see what they're up to? 
KNIGHT: No! If there's one thing that I've learned, it's never push your luck. Now come on.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

WEAMS: Tibet? Tibet? You're joking. 
BLAKE: That's where old Travers says they come from. He reckons they're Abominable Snowmen. 
WEAMS: Well, he's off his chump, ain't he? How'd they get here in the first place? 
BLAKE: Come through the post, don't they? 
WEAMS: Nah, seriously. Outer space, that's where they come from. Well, that's what I reckon, anyway. 
BLAKE: Oh do leave off. You've been reading too many kids' comics, you have. 
WEAMS: All right then, Corp, where do they come from? 
BLAKE: It's a foreign power, ain't it? Bacteriological warfare, that's what that stuff is in the tunnels. 
WEAMS: What, that fungus stuff? 
BLAKE: Yeah. And them Yeti are some sort of new weapon. Well, a sort of robot army. 
WEAMS: What, you mean it ain't real then? 
BLAKE: Well of course they ain't, you nit! Otherwise we'd be able to knock 'em out with the small arms, wouldn't we? 
WEAMS: Yeah. Nothing hardly touches them, does it? 
BLAKE: Not unless you can cop 'em straight between the eyes. Then they've had it. 
WEAMS: Yeah, well that'll take some doing. I mean, I'd have a job just holding me arm steady if one of them ugly creeps came at me, wouldn't I? 
BLAKE: Yeah. I wish we had some more hand grenades, cus they're the things that seem to stop them dead in their tracks. 
WEAMS: Yeah, but we ain't got any, have we? 
BLAKE: It's a pity that ammo truck they stopped at Holborn had all the gear in. 
WEAMS: Stone me! Here, we ain't got much of a chance if we come up against that lot, have we. 
BLAKE: Not with the funny old crowd we got down here with us. You got civvies, RE's, REME. 
WEAMS: Here, watch it, mate. 
BLAKE: The lot. A right old Fred Karno's Army, innit? Still, not to worry, me old son. Not the end of the world, is it. Want some more tea? 
WEAMS: Yeah, all right mate. 
BLAKE: Well, move then. 
(Weams glances at an illuminated map of the underground.) 
WEAMS: Here, Corp, look at this. 
BLAKE: What? 
(The rail lines are marked in white and the web fungus is tracked by a black line which runs around the Circle Line. The Jubilee hadn't been built yet.) 
BLAKE: Oh, crikey. That's what comes of talking about it. 
WEAMS: It's that fungus stuff, it's moving again. 
(Euston Square flickers out and the black line moves on Kings Cross.)

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

TRAVERS: Oh, Anne, come and do this for me, will you? 
ANNE: All right, father. 
TRAVERS: It's my hands. Can't control them! Getting old, that's my trouble. 
ANNE: Don't worry. 
TRAVERS: I can't help it. I feel responsible somehow. If only the Doctor would turn up. I'm sure he could help us. 
(A knock at the door.) 
BLAKE: Excuse me, sir. 
TRAVERS: Eh, what? 
BLAKE: That fungus stuff. It's on the move again. Euston Square's gone. 
TRAVERS: Come on, let's have a look.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

TRAVERS: Is it on the move again, Weams? 
WEAMS: Yes, sir. Kings Cross has gone out, and it's moving on to Farringdon. 
ANNE: It's never moved as fast as this before. 
WEAMS: Hasn't moved at all the last three weeks, Miss. 
BLAKE: What started it up again all of a sudden? 
TRAVERS: Can't say. 
CHORLEY: Strange, isn't it, that all this should happen on the very day that your mysterious Doctor friend turned up? 
ANNE: He hasn't turned up. 
CHORLEY: Precisely. He could have sent those kids in here as spies. 
TRAVERS: Rubbish! Would Jamie go away and leave Victoria, if he didn't intend coming back again? 
BLAKE: Excuse me, sir, but where is the young lady? 
TRAVERS: Oh, in the Common Room, I suppose. 
BLAKE: No, she's not, cus I went in there when I was looking for you. 
TRAVERS: What? Well, where is she then?

[Tunnel]

VICTORIA: Jamie? Doctor? Jamie? Doctor?

[Goodge Street Ops room]

ANNE: Not a sign of her. 
BLAKE: We looked everywhere. 
TRAVERS: Well, then, she must have gone 
CHORLEY: Like I said, a couple of spies. 
WEAMS: Look, sir. The fungus, it's moving again. 
(The black line is closing in on Liverpool Street.) 
BLAKE: I hope the Captain and Staff Arnold aren't anywhere near that little lot.

[Tunnel]

(A voice in the distance is singing scales.) 
ARNOLD: What is it, sir? 
KNIGHT: Quiet! Listen. Quick, get in there. 
(The soldiers hide in an alcove.) 
EVANS [OC]: (sings) Sosban fach yn berwi ar y tân, Sosban fawr yn berwi ar y llawr, A'r gath wedi 
(Evans passes the alcove and Arnold steps out behind him.) 
ARNOLD: Soldier. 
EVANS: Well, there's a sight for sore eyes. 
KNIGHT: Are you stark raving mad? 
EVANS: Aye, well, I always sing when I'm scared, see. 
ARNOLD: Stand to attention when you're talking to an officer. Name and last three. 
EVANS: Six oh 
ARNOLD: Shush! 
EVANS: (sotto) Six oh one Evans, sir. 
KNIGHT: Evans? Anybody know him? 
EVANS: Oh, I'm not one of your lot, sir. 
ARNOLD: Then what are you doing down here? 
EVANS: Trying to get out, Sarge. 
ARNOLD: Don't try to be funny with me, lad. How did you get down here in the first place? 
EVANS: Driver on the ammo truck to Holborn. Got jumped, we did. Quite a dust up, there was. Couldn't get past them hairy creatures, see? Been wandering for hours. Lost, I was. I tried one way, but there seemed to be some sort of cobweb muck moving down the tunnel. 
KNIGHT: Moving? Are you sure it was moving? 
EVANS: Well of course I'm sure, sir. Sounds daft, I know, but it seemed to be following a Yeti that had a kind of pointed glass thing in its hands. 
JAMIE: Was it shaped like a pyramid? 
EVANS: Well, I suppose it was, really. 
JAMIE: Well, that's it. Smash the pyramid, and you put the Intelligence out of action. 
KNIGHT: What Intelligence? 
ARNOLD: Whereabouts did you say this happened? 
EVANS: Kings Cross, Staff. 
KNIGHT: What? 
ARNOLD: Headquarters, sir. HQ may be in danger. 
KNIGHT: Yes. We'd better get back as soon as we can. 
JAMIE: No, look. 
ARNOLD: You heard what the officer said. Now come on. 
JAMIE: Look, I came down here to find the Doctor. I'm not going back till I have. 
ARNOLD: Now look here 
JAMIE: No, I'm not going. And if I get a chance to smash that pyramid, I will. 
KNIGHT: That's quite a risk you're taking. 
JAMIE: Aye, but it's me that's taking it. 
KNIGHT: All right, it's your neck, chum. 
EVANS: Sir? 
KNIGHT: Yes? 
EVANS: I'd like to volunteer to go with the young gentleman, sir. 
KNIGHT: Well, you're not one of my lot. All right. Come on, the rest of you. 
(The soldiers leave.) 
JAMIE: Thanks. 
EVANS: Don't be daft, boyo. First chance I get and I'm skipping.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

WEAMS: Liverpool Street gone now, sir. 
TRAVERS: But still no movement on the southern section. 
BLAKE: No sign of the Captain yet. 
WEAMS: Once this stuff joins up, we've had it. Why don't we try and get out now, while we've still got a chance? 
CHORLEY: Sounds like a very good idea to me. 
TRAVERS: No, no. The decision to evacuate this fortress must be taken by Captain Knight. 
ANNE: Yes, but where is he, Father? He's been gone for ages. 
BLAKE: Let's just hope he's not on the Circle Line.

[Cannon Street Underground platform]

EVANS: Here we are, then. Cannon Street. Circle Line. 
JAMIE: We've gone miles out of our way. 
EVANS: I told you I didn't know one tunnel from another, didn't I? 
JAMIE: Why didn't you tell me about these maps before? 
EVANS: You never asked. Who wants to find a Yeti anyway? 
JAMIE: Monument next then Tower Hill. Come on, we must find that pyramid.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

CHORLEY: Oh, thank heavens you're back, Captain. 
ANNE: Where are the other men? 
KNIGHT: Gone. 
TRAVERS: Captain, come here. The southern section's on the move. Charing Cross and the Temple have gone. 
CHORLEY: Look, Weams says there's a danger we might be cut off. Now don't you think it would be a very good idea if 
KNIGHT: If you want to leave, Mister Chorley, no one's stopping you. Now, when did all this happen? 
TRAVERS: Just after you left. Still no sign of the Doctor? 
KNIGHT: None. 
ANNE: Or the girl? 
KNIGHT: Has she gone too? 
TRAVERS: Yes. 
ARNOLD: That means all three of them are out there, sir. 
KNIGHT: Yes. But where?

[Tunnel]

VICTORIA: Doctor? Jamie? 
(Victoria is lost. A figure in the darkness hears her and hides as she goes past.) 
VICTORIA: Doctor?

[Goodge Street Ops room]

WEAMS: I think we've had it, Corp. 
BLAKE: Yeah, that stuff's got us trapped, all right. 
TRAVERS: Captain? Look, I know it seems hopeless, but if we could find the Doctor I'm sure he could help us. 
KNIGHT: Perhaps. But I'm sure that he must be dead by now. 
ARNOLD: If any of those three are on the Circle Line, sir, they've had it. 
CHORLEY: Captain Knight? Captain Knight! Cannon Street and Tower Hill have gone now. 
KNIGHT: That just leaves the Monument.

[Monument Underground station platform]

JAMIE: Monument. That's Tower Hill next. 
EVANS: Hey, wait a minute. Did you hear something? 
JAMIE: What? 
EVANS: Listen. 
(There's a pulsing noise.) 
JAMIE: Look! The fungus, it's here! 
(A bright glow of white light emanates from the tunnel.) 
JAMIE: We'd better get out, fast. 
(But a mass of web is blocking their retreat too.) 
JAMIE: We're trapped! 
(The web rolls along the platform towards them.) 
EVANS: We've had it, boyo. We can't go forward, and we can't go back.

Episode Three

[Monument Underground station platform]

(Jamie and Evans cover their ears as the high-pitched noise echoes through the tunnels. The web closes in, pulsating and getting brighter.) 
JAMIE: We've got to get to that archway. 
EVANS: There's something coming through. Look! 
(A Yeti walks out of the web carrying a small pyramid.) 
JAMIE: The pyramid! Shoot the pyramid! 
(Evans shoots at it twice but misses.) 
JAMIE: The pyramid! Get it! 
(Two more misses.) 
JAMIE: Come on, man, try again! 
(Evans shoots one more and the pyramid goes Boom! The Yeti stands still but the web keeps moving.) 
JAMIE: But we've destroyed the pyramid. It doesn't work! 
EVANS: Let's get out while we can. 
JAMIE: But you shot it! 
EVANS: Don't argue, come on, 
(The Yeti moves again with the web. Jamie and Evans run for the archway.)

[Tunnel]

VICTORIA: Doctor? Doctor, is that you? 
COLONEL: One moment. 
(Everyone say Hi! to Nicholas Courtney as Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart. Hooray!) 
DOCTOR: Victoria! 
VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor, thank goodness I found you. Are you all right? 
DOCTOR: Well. 
VICTORIA: Who's this? 
DOCTOR: Well, you see, Victoria. 
COLONEL: Well before you begin this rapturous reunion, there are one or two questions I'd like answered. For a start, is there anyone else down here playing hide and seek? 
VICTORIA: Well 
DOCTOR: Well, yes. Where is Jamie, Victoria? 
VICTORIA: He came out to look for you. 
COLONEL: Out? Out from where? 
VICTORIA: The fortress at Goodge Street. 
COLONEL: Goodge Street? Hang on, are you anything to do with Travers and his daughter? 
DOCTOR: Travers? What do you mean, Travers? 
VICTORIA: It's the same man we met in Tibet. I've come to warn you. He thinks you're responsible for the Yeti. 
DOCTOR: Me?  
COLONEL: Oh, does he? The plot thickens, doesn't it? I think it's time I got you two back to HQ. Lead on. 
DOCTOR: Come along, Victoria.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

ANNE: Well, that's it. The whole of the Circle Line gone. We're completely hemmed in. 
KNIGHT: Yes, we can't get out, and no one can get in. Not very healthy, is it? 
LANE: Excuse me, sir. 
KNIGHT: Yes, Corporal, what is it? 
LANE: That girl's turned up again, sir, and that Doctor feller you was looking for. 
ARNOLD: Oh, him? 
LANE: Yes, Staff. They was brought in by a Colonel. 
ARNOLD: A Colonel? 
KNIGHT: Where did he spring from? 
LANE: I don't know, sir. 
KNIGHT: I suppose I'd better show my face. Where are they? 
LANE: Corporal Blake's got them in the Common Room, sir, under guard. 
KNIGHT: Anne, you'd better fetch your father. He'll want a word with the Doctor. And you carry on here, Staff. 
ARNOLD: Sir! 
(Knight, Lane and Anne leave.) 
WEAMS: Here, Staff, this Colonel, where'd he come from? What's he doing here? 
ARNOLD: Don't ask me, lad. It's turning into a proper holiday camp, this place.

[Goodge Street Common room]

VICTORIA: You're sure? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I'm quite all right, Victoria. I was just knocked out by the explosion a bit, that's all. 
VICTORIA: Where did the Colonel come from? 
DOCTOR: Well, I don't know. When I came to, there was no sign of the Yeti, so I wandered around for a bit and then, as I was on my way back to you, he suddenly popped out from nowhere. 
VICTORIA: How did you find out about the Intelligence? 
DOCTOR: When I saw the Yeti, I put two and two together. And then now you say Travers is here, well. 
(Knight enters.) 
COLONEL: Afternoon. Captain Knight? 
KNIGHT: Afternoon, Colonel? 
COLONEL: Lethbridge-Stewart. Expect you're wondering who the devil I am, eh? 
KNIGHT: Well, as a matter of fact, sir, yes. 
COLONEL: Well, I couldn't tell you before but you're a bit cut off down here, aren't you? I'm taking over from Pemberton. Sorry about him. Very fine soldier. 
KNIGHT: Taking over? I see. Well, excuse me, Colonel, but have you got any 
COLONEL: Authorisation? Yes, of course. Here are my papers. Glad to see you don't take things at face value. 
KNIGHT: All right, Blake. You can fall out. 
BLAKE: Sir! 
(Blake leaves.) 
KNIGHT: How did you get in, sir? 
COLONEL: Holborn. Ammunition party. Got badly beaten up. All the men dead, I'm afraid. 
KNIGHT: Not all. Evans managed to escape. 
COLONEL: Evans? 
KNIGHT: The driver. 
COLONEL: Oh, yes. 
KNIGHT: Evans didn't mention any other survivors. 
COLONEL: No, well, it all got a bit confused. Driven into a side tunnel, myself. After that, got a bit lost, and then found this Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I was wondering when you where going to get around to me. 
KNIGHT: Yes, well, the Professor's spoken for him. We do know a little about the Doctor already. 
COLONEL: I see. In fact, more than you do about me, eh? 
KNIGHT: To tell you the truth, sir, yes. 
(Travers bursts in.) 
TRAVERS: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Who? 
TRAVERS: Oh, my dear fellow, am I glad to see you! 
DOCTOR: My word, it is. It's been a long time. 
COLONEL: Professor, I'm told you know this man. 
TRAVERS: Huh? I'd have thought that was obvious. And if it comes to that, who are you? 
COLONEL: Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart. New C.O. So you can vouch for the Doctor here? 
TRAVERS: Well, of course I can. 
COLONEL: And what about this girl? 
DOCTOR: Oh, she's on my staff. 
TRAVERS: We've got lots to do, Doctor. Time's running short. Need your help. Captain Knight, I'll take him straight down to the lab. Now come on, Doctor. You'd better come too, Victoria. Things are getting a bit desperate, and I've got an idea 
(Travers, the Doctor and Victoria leave.) 
COLONEL: It would seem that the Professor's in charge down here, Captain. 
KNIGHT: Yes, well, he does have a job to do, sir. I think it's best to let him get on with it, don't you?

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

DOCTOR: Yes, well as I say, when I came to there was no sign of the Yeti, so I wandered around a bit, got lost and saw the fungus. 
ANNE: You've seen it, then? 
TRAVERS: Oh, foul stuff. Oh, it was the Intelligence, all right. 
DOCTOR: Not me, then? 
TRAVERS: Huh? What do you mean? 
DOCTOR: From what Victoria said, you had one or two suspicions about me. 
TRAVERS: Rubbish, my dear fellow. Whatever gave you that idea, Victoria? Pah! Never heard anything so ridiculous in all my life. 
ANNE: So you did hear us talking, then? 
VICTORIA: Yes. 
TRAVERS: Oh, that. Well, it was only just idle chatter. Oh yes, it was the Intelligence that brought you here, all right. 
DOCTOR: But why? That's what I can't understand. Why? 
TRAVERS: Yes, well, you've given it the slip, Doctor. It doesn't know where you are yet. 
VICTORIA: I hope it hasn't caught Jamie.

[St Pauls Underground platform]

JAMIE: Saint Pauls. 
EVANS: We're on the Central Line, all right. 
JAMIE: Right, come on 
EVANS: Wait a minute. 
JAMIE: What is it? 
EVANS: Nothing. Want a bar of chocolate, that's all. Got sixpence? 
JAMIE: Ach, don't be daft! Those beasties might be right behind us. Now come on! 
EVANS: All this walking. Shouldn't be down here at all, you know. Driver, I am. 
(Evans pulls the lever the vending machine by the platform. It gives him a bar of chocolate at no cost.) 
EVANS: Well, there's lovely.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

CHORLEY: Don't you understand, Sergeant? I've got to get out of here! 
ARNOLD: Well I don't see as I can put it any clearer, sir. We're here at Goodge Street, right? And the fungus has gone all the way round the Circle Line. 
CHORLEY: Yes, I know that, man, but these other tunnels, the Northern Line, the Central Line, I mean, they're not filled, are they. 
ARNOLD: No, sir 
CHORLEY: They must be on a different level to the Circle Line. I mean, Wait a minute, it's absolutely simple. We go out under the stuff. 
ARNOLD: Now look, sir. You know we've already lost two men trying to do that. The influence of this fungus extends through the earth, both downwards and up. Believe me, sir, we're trapped. 
CHORLEY: But I've got to get out. You see, well, my reports are so important. I mean, the world must know what's going on down here. I mean, well, there must be a way out. The surface. What's on the surface? 
ARNOLD: Well, there's a ground level door in Cheney Street, sir, but 
CHORLEY: Of course, of course, of course. Thank you, Sergeant. thank you. 
(Chorley leaves.) 
WEAMS: He's a nutter. 
ARNOLD: You're telling me. Can't even get my rank right. 
WEAMS: Yeah, I noticed that, Sergeant. 
ARNOLD: Cheeky!

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

DOCTOR: But how, that's what I can't understand. What brought the Intelligence back again? 
TRAVERS: That was my wretched curiosity, I'm afraid. You see, when I came back from Tibet, I brought quite a bit of stuff with me. You know. Broken Yeti, bits of control spheres, and things like it. Oh, the monks were only too glad to see the back of it. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
TRAVERS: Yes, and then, my dear fellow, one of the control spheres was intact. So naturally I wanted to find out how it worked. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear. 
TRAVERS: I fiddled with the thing on and off for years, and then one day 
DOCTOR: Don't tell me. It just disappeared. 
TRAVERS: Mmm. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Well presumably, once the sphere started working, the Intelligence just homed in on it. 
TRAVERS: Yes, and with a fully functional Yeti, well, it was a ready made pair of hands for the Intelligence. 
(Knight enters.) 
KNIGHT: Sorry to interrupt, Professor, but Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart has decided to hold a briefing. He'd like you all to attend. 
ANNE: A briefing? We're not in the army yet, Captain. 
KNIGHT: Yes, I know that, Miss Travers, but now that he's taken over command, he thinks it would be the simplest way of being put in the picture. 
TRAVERS: Yes, splendid idea. Might help you too, Doctor. Now come on, I'd like to show you the layout as I've already 
(Travers and the Doctor leave.) 
KNIGHT: If you'll just make your way to the Common Room, you'll find that he's waiting for you. 
ANNE: Captain. 
VICTORIA: Any news of Jamie? 
KNIGHT: No. No, I'm afraid not.

[Tunnel]

EVANS: Come on, boy-o. Not far to Chancery Lane now. 
JAMIE: You're in a hurry, all of a sudden. 
EVANS: Aye, well I've got it all worked out, see. Next station's where I'm getting off. 
JAMIE: What? 
EVANS: Aye. Last time, the Yeti were at Holborn Station, so I reckon if I can get out at Chancery Lane, I might be able to reach my lorry. 
JAMIE: So you meant what you said, then? You're not going back to HQ? 
EVANS: No, I'd be more of an hindrance, I would. Anyway, I'm not supposed to be down here. I'm a driver, I am. 
JAMIE: Aye, there is another word I could use. Look, all you want to do is save your own skin. 
EVANS: Well, it's the only one I got. Look, boy-o, they don't stand a chance back there. Hop it with me now, boy, while the while the going's good. You've got to take care of Number One in this world. You'll learn. I'm getting out of these tunnels fast.

[Goodge Street Common room]

KNIGHT: So this was the situation on the fifth. Next slide, Blake. 
(A picture of the Natural History Museum shrouded in mist.) 
KNIGHT: Ah, yes sir, this will give you a better idea. You can see the fog, or mist, very clearly. 
DOCTOR: This mist, does it do anything? I mean, is it poisonous or anything? 
TRAVERS: No, no, no. But if anyone goes into it they just, well, they just don't come out again. 
COLONEL: As soon as the effect of the mist was known, this whole area was cordoned off. But by the sixth, the area had expanded to include South Ken tube station. Right, carry on, Knight. 
KNIGHT: Sir. Next slide please, Blake. Now, you can see how quickly it was spreading. 
COLONEL: Ah yes, that'd be the seventh, the day the fungus was first reported in the Underground. The tube system had to be abandoned, of course. 
DOCTOR: Any sign of the Yeti by this date? 
KNIGHT: No, they weren't sighted until the ninth. Next slide. 
(Two Yeti.) 
DOCTOR: Ah yes. My word, I thought I wasn't mistaken. Those Yeti have changed in appearance. Look. 
TRAVERS: Why, yes. I see what you mean. 
DOCTOR: It's a sort of Mark Two, isn't it. 
TRAVERS: Yes, very interesting. 
DOCTOR: I wonder how the Intelligence managed that? 
KNIGHT: Gentlemen. 
TRAVERS: I'm so sorry. 
DOCTOR: Sorry. 
KNIGHT: Now by this time, the fungus below ground and the fog above had both extended. Slide. 
(An aerial picture of west London with a band of fog encircling Hyde Park.) 
COLONEL: Ah yes, that's it. Now, notice this thin area of mist linking the two arms. I think we must now assume that this mist covers the entire area enclosed by the Circle Line. 
DOCTOR: Have you had any success against it yet? 
KNIGHT: No. We've tried chemicals, flame throwers, explosives. All to no avail. 
COLONEL: That's why we're dependent on you three coming up with the answers. If you fail, London's finished. England itself, perhaps. Now the army will, of course, give you all the support you need. Tell me, Miss Travers, what progress have you made so far? 
ANNE: Well, my father and I think we may be able to jam the transmissions to the Yeti. 
TRAVERS: What we really need is some additional equipment. 
COLONEL: Knight? 
KNIGHT: Well, sir, the main problem has been lack of communication. As you know, this fog absorbs all radio waves. 
DOCTOR: What about telephones? 
KNIGHT: All right for a while, but the Yeti soon destroyed them. We've laid a couple of lines ourselves between here and Holborn, but I don't know how long they'll last. 
(Chorley enters. Everyone who knows him groans.) 
CHORLEY: Ah, Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart. 
COLONEL: What is it, Mister Chorley? We're in the middle of a briefing. 
CHORLEY: Yes, so I see. Did you know about this door to the surface? A helicopter could lift us all out. 
COLONEL: Could it? Always assuming we could make contact with the outside world, which we can't, how do you imagine they would find us in that mist? Sit down, please. 
CHORLEY: Look, Colonel, I resent your tone. You seem to forget that I'm here as a representative of the Press, and as such 
COLONEL: And as such, Mister Chorley, you are no more than a passenger. Staff, lights please. 
ARNOLD: Sir! 
CHORLEY: Right! 
(Chorley leaves as the others mutter.) 
COLONEL: Right, let's get down to some constructive thinking.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

CHORLEY: Ah, Weams. Weams, I'd like some information, man. 
WEAMS: Sir? 
CHORLEY: Now would I be right in thinking there are a lot of very tall buildings in this area? 
WEAMS: Well, the Post Office Tower, that ain't far away. 
CHORLEY: The Post Office Tower, yes. Do you think that's above the mist? 
WEAMS: Well, I wouldn't know about that, sir, would I? 
CHORLEY: Where is it in relation to the Circle Line? Come on, man, where is it? 
WEAMS: Well, it's about here. Crikey! 
CHORLEY: What's the matter? 
WEAMS: Can't you see? It's that fungus stuff starting up again. I've got to tell the Colonel! 
(Knightsbridge, Regents Park and St Pauls flicker out.)

[Tunnel]

(Jamie is alone when he hears a noise and hides in an alcove. Evans walks past and Jamie surprises him.) 
EVANS: Argh! You gave me a fright there for a minute, boy. 
JAMIE: I thought you were supposed to be 
EVANS: Aye, well, I changed my mind, see. Quite right, you were. Can't leave your mates when they're in trouble, can you? 
JAMIE: Oh, aye? 
EVANS: No, well, it wouldn't be right, would it? 
JAMIE: Well, what was it like up top then? 
EVANS: Don't know. Well, between you and me, I couldn't get out, see. The gates were locked. 
JAMIE: Come on. 
EVANS: Aye, let's get over to HQ. At least we'll be safe there.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

COLONEL: Queensway, Lancaster Gate, Strand, Chancery Lane. All in a half hour, and it's creeping in all the time. How long do you think we've got, Professor? 
TRAVERS: It's difficult to say. Why, at this rate, oh, a couple of hours at the most. 
CHORLEY: Look, Colonel, you've got to do something. We can't just stand here waiting, can we? 
COLONEL: Ah, Mister Chorley. You'd like to help, wouldn't you? 
CHORLEY: Well, I 
COLONEL: Yes, of course you would. Now look, I'll tell you what I want you to do. We shall all be rushing about a bit, so what I want you to do is to wait in the Common Room. Act as a sort of Liaison Officer. You could do that, couldn't you? 
CHORLEY: Well, I don't know, I 
COLONEL: Yes, of course you could. Off you go. We'll all report progress to you personally. 
CHORLEY: What, do you mean coordinate things? 
COLONEL: Yes, that's it. Corporal Blake? 
BLAKE: Sir? 
COLONEL: See that Mister Chorley has everything he needs. Desk, comfortable chair, plenty of paper and so on. 
BLAKE: Sir! 
COLONEL: Off you go. 
(Chorley and Blake leave.) 
COLONEL: Right, that's enough diplomacy for one day. Now, let's get down to some practical soldiering. Doctor, you've been very quiet. Any ideas? 
DOCTOR: Well, as far as I can see, what we most need is time. Now if we were to blow the tunnel here, just above Goodge Street, we could seal ourselves in for a bit. 
COLONEL: Good. Practical suggestion. Staff, have we got any explosives? 
ARNOLD: There is a bit, sir. 
COLONEL: Enough to blow the tunnel? 
ARNOLD: Just about enough, sir. 
KNIGHT: The trouble is, every time we lay the charges, the Yeti cocoon them. 
DOCTOR: I've thought of that. Got anything on wheels, something that will run along a track? 
KNIGHT: Yes, yes, there's a baggage trolley. I think it's beside the stairs. Go and see, would you, Staff? 
ARNOLD: Yes, sir. Be the wrong gauge, of course. We'll soon fix up that though, sir. 
(Arnold leaves.) 
COLONEL: What's the plan? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's simple enough. We lay the explosives on the trolley and set a triggering device, and then blow it up while it's on the move. 
COLONEL: Yes. Yes, that should work. 
DOCTOR: Come on, Travers, let's fix up this detonator. 
COLONEL: Think I'll take the opportunity to have a look around the place. Let me know when you've got the trolley organised. 
KNIGHT: Sir. 
WEAMS: Glad to see we're doing something active at last, sir. 
KNIGHT: Yes. Let's hope that it works. 
(Marble Arch goes out.) 
KNIGHT: It had better! 
(Meanwhile, someone moves stealthily to the main door and unbolts it, leaving the Fortress open to attack.)

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

(Victoria is looking at a model Yeti.) 
ANNE: You've seen those things before, Victoria? 
VICTORIA: Yes. I remember them in Tibet. The Intelligence used them to guide the robot Yeti. 
(The Doctor enters.) 
DOCTOR: Ah, there you are, Victoria. I've been looking for you everywhere. Oh, my word. That looks familiar. It doesn't work, does it? 
ANNE: No. Neither do the other three. 
VICTORIA: Three? There are only two. 
ANNE: Well, that's funny. There's one missing. I wonder where that's got to. 
(It is with the mysterious person who has laid them open to attack. They make adjustments to it and it starts beeping quietly, then it is put by the door to the explosives store. In a tunnel, a Yeti comes to life, turns and heads towards the signal.) 
TRAVERS: Doctor? Sorry to have been so long, but I've got your blowing-up thingamajig. Here we are. 
DOCTOR: Ah, good. Fine. This should do the trick. It's both timing and contact. 
ANNE: Well, I think Victoria's right. 
TRAVERS: What on earth are you talking about? 
ANNE: The explosion. We'll be cut off, all right, but so will Jamie. 
VICTORIA: Don't you see? He'll be trapped. 
(The Yeti arrives at the Fortress and goes inside, holding a web gun. It walks along the corridors to the explosives store. The Yeti pulls off the padlock.)

[Goodge Street Ops room]

COLONEL: And this will explode in 60 seconds? 
DOCTOR: Yes. Just push the trolley down the gradient, and that should give you enough time to get clear. 
KNIGHT: Yes, but suppose the Yeti stop it before it goes off? 
DOCTOR: Well, if it comes into contact with anything, it'll blow up at once. 
(Arnold enters.) 
ARNOLD: We've got the trolley on the line, sir. 
KNIGHT: Ah, thank you, Staff. 
ARNOLD: Funny thing, though, sir. The main door was open. 
COLONEL: Open? You sure about that? 
BLAKE: Sir! Sir, sorry to interrupt, sir, but I found this. 
KNIGHT: What is it? 
BLAKE: It's the padlock from the explosives store, sir. And this thing was with it. 
DOCTOR: Did you see inside? 
BLAKE: No, I thought best not. I left Lane on guard, sir. 
KNIGHT: Come on! 
WEAMS: Here, let's have a look at that thing. 
BLAKE: There. 
(It's the missing model Yeti.)

[Goodge Street Fortress entrance]

COLONEL: Staff, close that door, will you? 
ARNOLD: Sir! 
COLONEL: All right, Corporal. 
LANE: Sir! 
KNIGHT: Well, it seems quiet enough. Do you think there is something in there? 
DOCTOR: There's only one way of finding out, isn't there? 
(The explosives store is filled with a mass of pulsating web.) 
DOCTOR: Well, now we know. How are we going to blow up the tunnel now?

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

ANNE: Don't worry, Victoria. The Doctor promised he wouldn't blow the tunnel until the very last moment. 
VICTORIA: Yes, but Jamie 
ANNE: Jamie might be a lot safer than you or I at this moment. Have you thought of that? 
VICTORIA: Safe? But how? 
ANNE: Perhaps he was right off the Circle Line by the time it closed up. 
VICTORIA: Oh, do you really think so? 
ANNE: Of course. 
TRAVERS: Don't you worry, my dear. Why, the Doctor will find a way. Once we've blown the tunnels and sealed ourselves off, we'll be able to get on with the job in hand. Why, with Anne's technical knowledge, and the Doctor and I, the Intelligence won't stand a chance.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

DOCTOR: The Yeti have dealt with the explosives here, and I'm willing to bet they'll do the same with those at Holborn as well. 
COLONEL: Maybe. 
DOCTOR: I think you're wasting your time now, Colonel. 
COLONEL: Yes. Still, at least there's a chance. We must check. 
(Arnold enters.) 
ARNOLD: Search completed, sir. Headquarters all clear. No sign of Yeti. 
COLONEL: Good. Captain Knight got the men ready? 
ARNOLD: Yes, sir. 
COLONEL: Well, tell Captain Knight to start, will you? 
ARNOLD: Yes, sir. 
COLONEL: You and I will follow on behind, Staff. 
ARNOLD: Sir. 
COLONEL: Oh, better tell the Professor we're leaving. 
ARNOLD: Yes, sir. What about Mister Chorley? 
COLONEL: No. The less he knows, the better. 
ARNOLD: Sir. 
(Arnold leaves.) 
COLONEL: Right, I shall be leaving four men behind here. You'll be quite safe, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Will I? 
COLONEL: Huh? 
DOCTOR: Someone here is in league with the Yeti. Maybe even controlling them. 
COLONEL: What? 
DOCTOR: The main door didn't open by itself, did it? It may be any one of us. 
COLONEL: Me, perhaps? 
DOCTOR: Perhaps. 
COLONEL: Or even you?

[Goodge Street Common room]

CHORLEY: It's at Covent Garden, you say? 
VICTORIA: That's where we landed. 
CHORLEY: Oh, this is ridiculous. You can't land in an Underground station. 
VICTORIA: The Tardis can. It's not an ordinary sort of craft. 
CHORLEY: Look, look, you say it can get us out of here? 
VICTORIA: Yes. But the Doctor wouldn't go without Jamie. And now they're going to blow up the tunnel, I don't think we're going to 
CHORLEY: Blow up the tunnel? Blow up the tunnel? Well then, we'll never get out of here. And the Doctor won't leave until Jamie gets back, eh? Oh, there you are, Doctor, we were just talking about you. I hadn't realised what was going on. 
DOCTOR: Oh? 
CHORLEY: No 
(Chorley leaves, closing the door.) 
DOCTOR: What's the matter with him? 
VICTORIA: He doesn't want them to blow up the tunnel. 
DOCTOR: Well, he's too late. They've already left. Wait a minute. Why doesn't he want them to blow up the tunnel? 
VICTORIA: He thinks he'll be cut off from the Tardis. 
DOCTOR: You didn't tell him about the Tardis, did you? 
VICTORIA: Oh dear! Oh no! No, do you think that 
DOCTOR: Yes, I do think! 
VICTORIA: Oh, but 
DOCTOR: There you are. It's locked. Victoria!

[Goodge Street Fortress entrance]

CHORLEY: They've left already? 
JAMIE: Aye, we passed them a while back. 
EVANS: Aye, off to Holborn, they were. 
CHORLEY: Holborn, eh? Right. 
EVANS: Before you go, sir, could you tell me where? 
(Chorley has gone.) 
EVANS: Charming. 
(Someone is banging on a door.) 
JAMIE: Listen.

[Goodge Street Common room]

(It's the Doctor and Victoria doing the banging.) 
VICTORIA: I'm so worried about Jamie. 
DOCTOR: Wait. 
(The door opens.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
JAMIE: Doctor! Good to see you! 
VICTORIA: Oh Jamie, you're safe! 
DOCTOR: Jamie, have you seen Chorley? 
JAMIE: Who's he? Hey, why were you locked in? 
DOCTOR: Have you seen anyone leave headquarters here? 
JAMIE: Well, aye, just now. There's a man 
DOCTOR: Right, come along, no time to waste. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: Come on, I'll tell you as we go.

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

TRAVERS: But where's the Doctor? After all, this was his idea. 
ANNE: Well, shall I go and get him? 
(A man screams.) 
TRAVERS: Wait here. 
ANNE: Father, no!

[Goodge Street Ops room]

TRAVERS: Weams? Weams! 
(Craftsman Weams is dead, covered in web.) 
TRAVERS: What? 
(The model Yeti is on the floor beside the corpse.) 
TRAVERS: Good Lord. 
(A Yeti roars. Travers cries out.)

Episode Four

[Goodge Street Ops room]

TRAVERS: A Yeti! 
(The Yeti lashes at Travers, and he falls. Then it hits Anne, knocking her down, before dragging Travers out of the Fortress.)

[Tunnel junction]

JAMIE: Which way? 
DOCTOR: It's this way to Covent Garden. 
JAMIE: You're sure Chorley's after the Tardis though? 
DOCTOR: Yes, certain of it. Why else would he lock us in? 
JAMIE: Aye, maybe you're right. 
EVANS: Like me to take a shufty down this tunnel? He might have taken a wrong turning. 
DOCTOR: No, no, no, if he did it doesn't matter, does it? Come along, this way.

[Tunnel two]

(Going towards Holborn.) 
ARNOLD: What is it, sir? 
COLONEL: Something up ahead. It's all right. Captain Knight and his party. 
ARNOLD: They've been very quick, sir. 
COLONEL: Any luck? 
KNIGHT: Afraid not, sir. The fungus beat us to it. A hundred yards this side of Holborn. 
ARNOLD: Just as if it knew what we were up to, sir. 
COLONEL: Yes. 
KNIGHT: There's just a chance, Colonel, that we might be able to get to Holborn via Piccadilly. 
COLONEL: Fungus on the Central Line only, eh? 
KNIGHT: Well, it's worth a try, sir. 
COLONEL: Yes, right. Tottenham Court Road, down to Leicester Square, and up past Covent Garden. Come on, follow me.

[Tunnel outside Covent Garden]

DOCTOR: This looks familiar. It's around this corner. 
JAMIE: Oh no! 
VICTORIA: Oh, we can't get to the Tardis! 
DOCTOR: No, Victoria, I'm afraid we can't. 
(They are blocked by pulsing web.) 
JAMIE: What's happened to Chorley, then? 
DOCTOR: That's what I'm wondering. Did he reach the Tardis before the fungus, or did he not? 
JAMIE: You mean to say, he could have got to the Tardis and already have taken off in it? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. 
JAMIE: Hey, come back, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: It's all right, Jamie. I'm not going to do anything silly. I just want to try and get a little bit for analysis. 
VICTORIA: Oh Jamie, stop him. 
DOCTOR: It's all right, Victoria. Has anyone got a box? 
EVANS: I've got my tobacco tin. 
DOCTOR: Oh, splendid. 
EVANS: But then it's got tobacco in it. 
DOCTOR: Never mind. 
EVANS: Hey! Oh, all right. I only hope you think the sacrifice is worth it. 
DOCTOR: Hold the tin for me, would you, Evans? 
(The Doctor begins to tug at a strand of the web, and it reacts by sending out a high-pitched sound which drives them back.) 
EVANS: Gone and set it off! Come on, now! 
VICTORIA: Oh, it's horrible. 
JAMIE: Come on, Doctor, get away 
DOCTOR: Hold the tin underneath. There we are. Now back, everyone, quickly!

[Tunnel junction]

ARNOLD: All right, Corporal. Get back and tell Captain Knight it's all clear up here. And get them to get a shift on. 
BLAKE: Right-ho, Staff. 
(Blake goes down one branch as Evans and Co come up the other.) 
EVANS: Hello, Staff. It's all right, it's just Staff Arnold! 
ARNOLD: One of these days, Evans my lad, you're going to creep up on someone once too often. 
EVANS: Well, that's life, innit Staff. 
DOCTOR: Any luck at Holborn? 
ARNOLD: No. Fungus. 
JAMIE: Same back there. 
ARNOLD: Right. I'll tell the Colonel. You lot had better get back to HQ. We'll be along in a few minutes. 
DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie, I'll just show this bit of fungus to Travers. 
JAMIE: Right.

[Goodge Street Fortress entrance]

JAMIE: The door's open, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Let's see, Jamie. 
(The door is hanging off it's hinges.) 
JAMIE: Hey, look at this! 
(Broken furniture and equipment covered in web.) 
DOCTOR: Good Lord! That's Yeti! 
JAMIE: You don't think they may still be here? 
DOCTOR: No. 
JAMIE: I hope not. 
(Victoria screams.) 
VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor! 
(There are bodies lying in the web.) 
DOCTOR: Quiet, Victoria.

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

DOCTOR: Anne! 
JAMIE: Miss Travers! 
VICTORIA: Will she be all right? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I think she'll be all right. Evans, get a chair for her, will you? Get her up, Jamie. Come along. It's all right. It's all right now, Anne. Sit down. 
JAMIE: There you are. 
DOCTOR: It's all right now. 
ANNE: Oh, Doctor, Doctor, the Yeti. Have they gone? 
DOCTOR: Yes, they've gone now. It's quite safe now. 
JAMIE: What happened? 
ANNE: My father. The Yeti! The Yeti, they've taken him! Oh, my. Oh. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, you'd better get her to the Common Room. 
JAMIE: Come along. 
DOCTOR: You go too, Victoria. 
JAMIE: It's all right, we'll find him for you. 
DOCTOR: Lie her down. 
JAMIE: Easy, that's it. 
EVANS: You okay? 
JAMIE: Yeah, I'll manage, thanks. 
(Jamie, Anne and Victoria leave.) 
EVANS: Do you reckon they have? 
DOCTOR: Have what? 
EVANS: Taken him, like she said? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm very much afraid they have. But why? Why didn't they just kill him? Unless 
EVANS: Yes? 
DOCTOR: Well, unless they had a use for him. 
COLONEL: Ah, Doctor. What's this I hear about Travers? 
DOCTOR: Well, the Yeti broke in while we were out looking for Chorley. 
COLONEL: Chorley? 
KNIGHT: What the devil was he doing in the tunnel in the first place? 
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not quite sure. 
KNIGHT: I knew that one would panic. 
ARNOLD: I'm afraid young Weams has had it, sir, like the other poor devils outside. 
COLONEL: I see. Staff, you'd better get 
ARNOLD: Yes, all right, sir. We're doing that now. Evans, come with me. 
EVANS: Staff! Glad to see you're all right, sir. 
COLONEL: Eh? 
EVANS: Drove you to Holborn, I did, sir. 
COLONEL: Ah yes, so you did. 
ARNOLD: Evans! 
EVANS: Sorry, Staff. 
(Evans and Arnold leave.) 
COLONEL: I can't make out why the Yeti broke in. I mean, they could have destroyed the place if they'd wanted to. 
DOCTOR: Well, the answer's simple. They came for something, and they got it. 
COLONEL: What was that? 
DOCTOR: Well, Travers. 
(Oxford Circus, Green Park, Trafalgar Square and Strand flicker on the Ops room wall map.) 
BLAKE: Excuse me, sir, but I think you ought to come to the Ops Room. 
KNIGHT: Why? What's happening? 
BLAKE: That fungus stuff, it's on the move again.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

(The flickering lights go out.) 
BLAKE: It's like a spider's web, ain't it? 
DOCTOR: Yes. And we're the flies, all right, but where is the spider? 
COLONEL: Better give the others a hand, Corporal. 
BLAKE: Sir. 
(Blake leaves.) 
COLONEL: Doctor. Been thinking about what you were saying earlier. About someone here in HQ being responsible for all this. Could it have been Travers? 
DOCTOR: I doubt it. 
KNIGHT: Well, after all he has disappeared. 
DOCTOR: Yes. So has Chorley. I'd say he was a much more likely suspect. 
COLONEL: True. 
DOCTOR: On the other hand, of course, whoever is in league with the Intelligence could still be amongst us here. 
COLONEL: That's a fact of which I am uncomfortably aware. But tell me, Doctor, this Intelligence, exactly what is it? 
DOCTOR: Well, I wish I could give you a precise answer. Perhaps the best way to describe it is a sort of formless, shapeless thing floating about in space like a cloud of mist, only with a mind and will. 
COLONEL: What's it after? What's it want? 
DOCTOR: I wish I knew. The only thing I know for sure is that it brought me here. 
KNIGHT: Brought you here? 
COLONEL: Yes, been wondering how you got here. 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I don't think there's any harm in telling you now. I have a craft that travels in time and space. 
KNIGHT: Oh, come now, Doctor, you can't expect me to 
COLONEL: This craft of yours, this time space craft. Could it get us out of here? 
DOCTOR: Well, yes, but it's at Covent Garden. 
COLONEL: What does it look like? 
DOCTOR: It's a police box. 
KNIGHT: Oh really, Colonel, you're surely not going
COLONEL: So if we could rescue that craft, you could take us out? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I could, but I have to stay here and finish Travers' work. 
(Jamie enters.) 
JAMIE: Ah, Doctor. Miss Travers is feeling all right now and would like to see you right away. 
DOCTOR: Very good, Jamie. Excuse me, gentlemen, please. 
COLONEL: Yes. 
(The Doctor and Jamie leave.) 
KNIGHT: Well, I've heard some stories in my time, but that one really takes 
COLONEL: So you don't believe him? 
KNIGHT: No, of course not, sir. The whole idea is screwy. A police box? 
COLONEL: Well whether you think it foolish or not, we are going to rescue that craft. 
KNIGHT: Oh, but sir. Our job 
COLONEL: Captain Knight, the Army has failed to defeat this menace. Now the Doctor thinks he might succeed. Personally, I doubt it. But if we stay here, we're as good as dead. Therefore I do not intend leaving any escape route unexplored, however screwy you may think it. 
KNIGHT: Oh, surely Colonel 
COLONEL: Let's get on with it, shall we, Knight? 
KNIGHT: Sir. I suppose you've considered that the Doctor might be leading us into a trap?

[Goodge Street Common room]

ANNE: But, but there must be a chance. If the Doctor says 
DOCTOR: No, the soldiers could comb these tunnels for a fortnight and still never find him. I'm afraid your father's been taken by the Intelligence. The only way that we can save him is by finding the central control source. 
JAMIE: Aye, if he's anywhere, that's where he'll be. 
ANNE: But why? Why him? Why not me, or one of the soldiers, or 
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. Tell me. What was your father working on just before the Yeti broke in, Anne? 
ANNE: We were ready to test the sphere with the control unit, but I don't see what this has to do with anything, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: But don't you? If he was near to success 
VICTORIA: That's why they took him. 
DOCTOR: Well, it's a possibility, isn't it? Now Anne, do you feel strong enough to come back to the laboratory? 
ANNE: Yes, yes, of course. 
JAMIE: Anything we can do? 
DOCTOR: No, no, you just take it easy, Jamie. Come along. 
(The Doctor and Anne leave.) 
JAMIE: What's the matter? 
VICTORIA: I've been thinking about what the Doctor said. Anything we do, the Intelligence always knows. 
JAMIE: Aye, but I wouldn't let it worry you. The Doctor will soon find a way out. 
VICTORIA: I wish I could believe that.

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

(The Doctor is examining the control sphere.) 
DOCTOR: Oh yes. Yes, this seems to be in order, Anne. 
ANNE: My father didn't want it put together until this was in proper order. 
DOCTOR: Very wise. Let's have a look at this 
(Anne shows the Doctor a control box.) 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, yes. My word, this is a splendid piece of work, Anne. 
ANNE: Thank you. 
DOCTOR: Yes, this should control the sphere all right, but would it override the commands issued by the Intelligence, I wonder? 
ANNE: No. No, I'm afraid it won't. I just didn't have the time. Do you think we can do it? 
DOCTOR: We can do it if you've got the right bits and pieces. 
(Evans has entered silently.) 
EVANS: Hope I'm not disturbing, Doctor, but Staff asked me to give you this. 
(A model Yeti.) 
DOCTOR: Where'd you get this? 
EVANS: On the floor, by that young lad Weams, it was. 
DOCTOR: But this is what brought the Yeti to the explosives store. It's obviously been reprogrammed as a homing device and you've given it to me! 
EVANS: Here, you don't think I had anything to do with these Yeti, do you? 
ANNE: Doctor. The other models. They've gone! 
EVANS: Well, don't look at me. I didn't want to come down here in the first place. I shouldn't be down here at all, really. Driver, I am, see. Well you'd better have this before you say I've nicked it. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
EVANS: And I'll have that tin back when you've finished with it. 
DOCTOR: Don't look so unhappy. We're all under suspicion, you know, including me. 
EVANS: Huh! 
(Evans leaves.) 
ANNE: What's in the tin, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: It's the fungus from the tunnel. I thought if we examined it, it might give us a clue. I must get this dismantled. It's like holding a time bomb.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

COLONEL: So my party will get above ground and approach Covent Garden by Neal Street. Is that clear? 
ALL: Yes, sir. 
COLONEL: Now Staff here will be taking the trolley through the tunnel, and will arrive, we hope, at the same time as we do. You picked your two men, Staff? 
ARNOLD: Yes, sir. Lane and Evans. 
COLONEL: Right. Now as soon as we get there, we shall be looking for a police box. 
BLAKE: A police box, sir? 
COLONEL: Yes, a police box. Now I want that box either out of the station or onto the trolley as quickly as possible. Is that understood? 
ARNOLD: Yes, sir. 
COLONEL: Right. Any questions? 
BLAKE: Yes, sir, this police box. Is it important? 
COLONEL: Corporal Blake, we'd hardly be going to this trouble if it weren't. 
KNIGHT: Who's going to look after the civilians, sir? 
COLONEL: I'd like you to stay behind and look after them, Captain Knight. The Doctor's got work to do. Right, gentlemen, time to go.

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

(The Doctor has the web sample behind protective shielding.) 
DOCTOR: Now you'd better stand back, Anne. 
ANNE: Is it really necessary, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: This fungus is an unknown quantity, you know. 
JAMIE: Ah, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie, what is it? 
JAMIE: The Colonel says to tell you he's on his way. 
DOCTOR: On his way where? 
JAMIE: To rescue the Tardis. 
DOCTOR: He's wasting his time. 
VICTORIA: Well that's what I told him. And I think that man Chorley must be behind 
DOCTOR: Shush. Now look. Get behind me, both of you, and keep clear. Here we go. 
(The Doctor pries the tobacco tin open.) 
DOCTOR: No! 
ANNE: What is it, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: The tin's empty! Evans.

[Goodge Street Fortress entrance]

EVANS: Of course, really I shouldn't be doing this, you know, Staff. Not officially on the strength down here, see. What I am really is a driver, you see 
ARNOLD: Don't try to come the old soldier with me, lad. 
EVANS: Who, me? 
ARNOLD: Yes, you. And when we get in the tunnels, don't you try to skive off, cus if you do I'll have you for breakfast. Do you understand? 
LANE: Trolley's ready, Staff. 
ARNOLD: Right, come on!

[Deserted street]

COLONEL: Right. So far, so good. If we don't see any Yeti, we should make Covent Garden in about ten minutes. Come on.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

JAMIE: Captain, they've gone, and Evans with them, I think. I can't find him anywhere. 
KNIGHT: Yes, well, we'd better question Evans carefully when he gets back. 
JAMIE: Aye, if he gets back. 
KNIGHT: It's a funny business, Doctor, that fungus disappearing. 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I know, but don't worry about that just at the moment. I've been working on this control box of Miss Travers'. There's a few more things I need. Transistors, circuits. 
KNIGHT: Aren't there any in Stores? 
DOCTOR: No, not of the right type. 
KNIGHT: Well in that case, Doctor, I can't help you. 
DOCTOR: Well, I was wondering if I could go up to street level 
VICTORIA: But the mist? Or the Yeti? 
DOCTOR: There's no mist directly above us here. We'd have to risk the Yeti. 
KNIGHT: No. No, I'm afraid that's out. 
ANNE: It's terribly important. Please. 
DOCTOR: It'd only take five minutes. 
KNIGHT: All right. I'll get my gear. 
DOCTOR: Well done, Travers. 
KNIGHT: And while we're gone, you three lock yourselves in. 
JAMIE: Oh aye.

[Tunnel]

ARNOLD: The Colonel will be through there at Covent Garden in a few minutes, right? 
EVANS: Do you think they'll be able to load the police box on here, Staff? 
ARNOLD: Well, if we can get this thing through the fungus stuff. There's not much of a gradient in this section of the tunnel. Right, I want one volunteer. 
EVANS: Volunteer? That's a dirty word, that is. Not me. 
ARNOLD: Lane? 
LANE: What for, Staff? 
ARNOLD: Well, this thing wants some help going through to Covent Garden. I'm going through with it. 
LANE: Into that stuff? 
ARNOLD: Have you got those respirators? 
LANE: Well, yeah, here. 
(Lane takes a couple of gas-masks out of his pack.) 
ARNOLD: I reckon we shall be all right in these. Oh, all right, Lane. I'll go by mesen. 
LANE: No, hang on a sec, Staff. That trolley's heavy. It'll take two of us to shift it. 
ARNOLD: Good lad. Come on. 
EVANS: You're potty, the pair of you. 
ARNOLD: Shut up, will you! Do as you're told. Play that rope out as we go. Any sign of trouble, whip us out sharpish, right? 
EVANS: Well, it's your neck. 
ARNOLD: Okay. 
LANE: All right then 
(Arnold and Lane put of the gas masks and stand either side of the trolley, then push it forward into the fungus. The light gets brighter and the pulse gets louder. There are screams.) 
EVANS: Staff? Staff Arnold? 
(Evans pulls on the rope and pulls out the trolley. Lane's body lies across it, covered in web. There is no sign of Arnold.) 
EVANS: Staff? 
(Evans flees the scene.)

[Covent Garden Market]

(Yeti are waiting for them.) 
BLAKE: Look, sir! 
COLONEL: In here, quick.

[Warehouse yard]

COLONEL: Come on, through the gate. I'm going to find a way out. Now split up. 
(The soldiers take cover behind tarpaulin-covered market stalls. The Yeti arrive at the gates and they open fire.) 
SOLDIER 1: Yetis. Three of them, sir. 
COLONEL: Grenade! 
(The grenades have no effect.) 
BLAKE: Right, fire! 
SOLDIER 1: Sir, they're smashing down the gate! 
BLAKE: We can't hold them, sir! 
COLONEL: Over the top, all of you! 
(The soldiers break cover and climb over a stack of wooden crates. One is caught and killed by a Yeti.) 
SOLDIER 2: Grenades! 
COLONEL: Through the yard, come on! Bazooka here to cover the others. 
(A soldier kneels with a bazooka balanced over his right shoulder, and fires. But the Yeti just keep coming.) 
COLONEL: Dawson! Langley! 
(Too late. He loses two more men.) 
COLONEL: Make for the warehouse! Murphy! 
(Again, too late. The survivors fall back to the warehouse itself.)

[Electrical shop]

(The Doctor and Knight are collecting supplies.) 
KNIGHT: There it is again, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Just one more thing. 
KNIGHT: For heaven's sake, hurry up. 
DOCTOR: I just need one more component. I'll look through here. 
(The Doctor goes into the back of the shop. Two Yeti appear in the doorway.) 
KNIGHT: Doctor! Doctor, look out! 
(The Yeti knock Knight aside.) 
KNIGHT: No! 
(The Doctor comes out of the back to see the Yeti standing over Knight's body. They look at the Doctor then leave. The Doctor searches Knight's pockets and finds a model Yeti.)

[Goodge Street Ops room]

JAMIE: And this was in his pocket, you say? 
VICTORIA: How did he get it? You said it was stolen. 
ANNE: Oh but you can't think that he stole 
DOCTOR: No, no, no, he didn't steal it. The person who did planted it on him. 
JAMIE: Hmm. 
EVANS: Don't you try and pin this on me, boy-o! Strikes me anything goes wrong around here and I'm always the one to get the blame. 
DOCTOR: All right, all right, let's keep our temper, shall we? The point is two of these were missing. Now where's the other one?

[Warehouse]

(The ammunition is running out and the Yeti take out the soldiers one by one. As Blake is clubbed down, the Colonel sprints across the yard, jumps the wall and runs for safety.

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

(The Doctor is dismantling the model Yeti.) 
DOCTOR: There. That one shouldn't bother us any more. Now then, come along, Anne, let's get down to work. Where did I put those bits and pieces? 
VICTORIA: I wish I knew who put it in the Captain's pocket. 
JAMIE: Well, it must have been Chorley. 
VICTORIA: Well look, he left ages ago. 
JAMIE: It doesn't matter. He could still 
DOCTOR: Colonel! 
VICTORIA: Are you all right? 
JAMIE: What's happened? 
DOCTOR: Colonel, what happened? 
COLONEL: Gone. 
VICTORIA: Not all of them? 
DOCTOR: All of them! 
COLONEL: I said so, didn't I? All of them. Evans, what about your party? Arnold? 
EVANS: Gone, sir. 
JAMIE: Captain Knight, too. 
COLONEL: Knight. Hopeless. 
(There's a faint beeping coming from somewhere.) 
COLONEL: Can't fight them. It seems indestructible. Can't fight them! You were right, Doctor, when you said they were formless, shapeless. You were right. 
DOCTOR: Listen. Listen, everyone! It's the other Yeti model. It's here! It's somewhere in this room! 
COLONEL: That noise, I've been hearing it on and off all day. 
DOCTOR: Your pockets! 
COLONEL: What? 
DOCTOR: Open your pockets, Colonel. Quickly, quickly, come on! 
(Guess what he finds.) 
COLONEL: How 
DOCTOR: They bring the Yeti! 
(Two Yeti crash in with Travers behind them, staring blankly.)

Episode Five

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

JAMIE: Oh, no. 
COLONEL: I just don't understand what's happening. 
JAMIE: Poor Travers. 
TRAVERS: Silence! 
ANNE: Father. 
DOCTOR: No, no. 
ANNE: But I must 
DOCTOR: No, Anne. Don't go near him. Just listen to him. 
(Travers' voice is not his own. He speaks slowly with gasps, rasping.) 
TRAVERS: I am the Intelligence. 
ANNE: No. 
JAMIE: You can't be. 
TRAVERS: Listen to me. I speak to you with this man's voice because the time has come for you to understand my purpose. 
EVANS: What's he getting at? 
COLONEL: Quiet. 
DOCTOR: What do you want? 
TRAVERS: You defeated me in Tibet, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
TRAVERS: Now you have fallen into the trap that I have so carefully prepared for you. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I see, so that's why you've brought me here. Revenge. 
TRAVERS: No. Revenge is a very human emotion. My purpose for you is far more interesting. 
DOCTOR: And what's that? 
TRAVERS: Through time and space, I have observed you, Doctor. Your mind surpasses that of all other creatures. 
DOCTOR: What do you want? 
TRAVERS: You! Your mind will be invaluable to me. Therefore I have invented a machine that will drain all past knowledge and experience from your mind. 
VICTORIA: But you'll kill him! 
TRAVERS: Oh no, he will survive, his mind unharmed. Only empty as a newborn child's. 
DOCTOR: And if I refuse? 
TRAVERS: Then I shall have to seek the help of lesser mortals, like your companions here. And many, many others. 
DOCTOR: But you can't! 
TRAVERS: I can and I will. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe you. 
JAMIE: You can't. We'll fight! 
TRAVERS: That will not do. The Doctor must submit willingly. 
DOCTOR: And if I do submit, what of the others? 
TRAVERS: Then the others will go free. 
ANNE: And my father too? 
TRAVERS: And him too. I'm only using this body to communicate with you. 
ANNE: He didn't help you before, then. 
TRAVERS: Oh, no. I have many other human hands at my command. 
DOCTOR: And who are they? 
TRAVERS: Always questioning! Even now, you're seeking to destroy me. I see I shall have to guide your thoughts. 
(Travers pulls Victoria towards him.) 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie, no. 
TRAVERS: Cooperate and the child will be unharmed. You have twenty minutes to make up your mind. 
JAMIE: Let me go, Doctor! 
(Travers and the Yeti leave, with Victoria.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, don't be a fool. You don't stand a chance. 
JAMIE: Let me go! Victoria! Let me past, Colonel. 
COLONEL: No, the Doctor's right. There've been enough lives wasted. 
JAMIE: And what are we going to do? Just sit around and wait for the next thing to happen? 
COLONEL: Don't be a fool, boy! We can't fight those things bare-handed. We must work out a plan! 
JAMIE: Well you do what you want, I'm going. 
(But there is a Yeti right outside the door.) 
DOCTOR: He left one of those things there to stop us getting away. Now, Victoria is quite safe. 
JAMIE: Safe? 
DOCTOR: The Intelligence knows that if it harms her, I won't cooperate. 
ANNE: Does that go for my father too? 
DOCTOR: Yes, Anne, it does. 
ANNE: Oh, are you sure? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure! 
EVANS: Permission to speak, sir. 
COLONEL: Yes, what is it, Evans? 
EVANS: Well, stop me if I've got it wrong, sir, but if this Intelligence thing here gets the Doctor, will he leave us all alone? 
COLONEL: Yes, that's what it looks like. What's in your mind? 
EVANS: Well, sir, why don't we just let it have him? Then we could all go home.

[Tunnel]

VICTORIA: Please, my wrist. Professor! Professor, please. You're hurting me. My wrist! Professor! 
(Travers pulls Victoria on towards the beep signal.)

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

COLONEL: Will this Intelligence keep its word, do you think? 
JAMIE: Well, it didn't in Tibet. 
DOCTOR: Jamie. 
EVANS: Leastways, it's a chance. 
JAMIE: But it's not you that's taking the risk, is it? 
EVANS: I reckon he ought to give himself up now. 
COLONEL: Evans, when I want your opinion I'll ask for it. 
EVANS: Sorry, sir. 
DOCTOR: It's all right, Evans. If I don't come up with the answer, I will give myself up, I promise. 
EVANS: That's okay then. 
JAMIE: You will not give yourself up. 
DOCTOR: Don't be foolish, Jamie! 
JAMIE: But Victoria! 
DOCTOR: She will be your responsibility. And when it's all over, you'll just both have to look after me, that's all. 
JAMIE: Ay? 
DOCTOR: Well, if what the Intelligence says is true, my mind will be like that of a child. You'll have to look after me until I grow up. 
JAMIE: Oh. 
DOCTOR: Don't worry. I'm going to try not to let it happen. 
EVANS: Hey, wait a minute. 
COLONEL: What is it, Evans? What's the matter now? 
EVANS: Stand back everyone. 
(Evans opens the door. The Yeti has gone.) 
EVANS: I thought I heard it go! 
COLONEL: Yes, well, we'd better make sure. Evans, you, myself and McCrimmon will go and search the place. Doctor, you'd better stay behind here and get on with your tinkering. 
(The Colonel, Jamie and Evans leave.) 
ANNE: You're not seriously thinking of giving yourself up to those creatures, are you? 
DOCTOR: I sincerely hope it won't come to that, Anne. 
ANNE: It's so hopeless. What can we do? 
DOCTOR: This control box. We've got to get it working! 
ANNE: Doctor, we've only got twenty minutes. 
DOCTOR: Then there's no time to lose, is there? Oh, come on, Anne, don't give up. I need your help. 
ANNE: Yes, of course. 
DOCTOR: Right. Now hand me that sphere, will you?

[Goodge Street Fortress corridor]

JAMIE: I suppose that Yeti was left there as a kind of rear guard. 
COLONEL: Possibly. 
JAMIE: If we went into the tunnels, we'd run into them again. 
COLONEL: Yes, probably would. 
JAMIE: But supposing we were to go over the top? You see, Colonel, as I see it, there's only one way for them to go. South. 
COLONEL: Yes? 
JAMIE: So if we could get ahead of them. 
COLONEL: What, take them by surprise, you mean? 
JAMIE: Aye. 
COLONEL: What's the point? You can't fight those things. I know, I've tried. 
EVANS: Anyway, we'd never get back in, sir. All the stations are locked. 
JAMIE: We might find one that's open. I mean, after all, the Yeti get in and out. Why can't we? 
EVANS: Well, I reckon we're safer here, sir. 
JAMIE: Aye, we are. But what about Victoria and Travers, eh? Och, if you're both too scared, I'll go myself. 
COLONEL: Wait a minute, McCrimmon. I think it's pointless, but at least we'll be doing something active. 
EVANS: What about the Doctor and Miss Travers, sir? 
COLONEL: Oh, yes. Mustn't leave them unprotected. You stay here, Evans. 
EVANS: Right, sir. 
COLONEL: And don't go taking any chances. 
EVANS: Don't worry. I won't.

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

DOCTOR: And the cross wires here. 
ANNE: I still don't see how you can 
DOCTOR: Well, I haven't finished yet. Now if you detach the germanium crystal strip here, and then attach the collector and the emitter. 
ANNE: Yes, yes, and link up there. Of course. Then the frequency variations, they'll automatically change! 
DOCTOR: Simple? 
ANNE: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Right. You get on with that. 
ANNE: Okay. 
DOCTOR: And I'll just check this sphere. Yes. Yes, that should complete the circuit. Good. I wonder?

[Goodge Street Fortress entrance]

JAMIE: There's only one way to find out. 
COLONEL: Yes. Certainly no sound out there. 
JAMIE: Shall we chance it, then? 
COLONEL: Why not. Now! 
(Jamie flings open the door, but there is a mass of fungus behind it.) 
JAMIE: No! Back! No! 
(They try to push the door closed again as the fungus makes it way inside.) 
COLONEL: Push! Push! Push, hard as you can! Push, get your back to it! Get your back to it! Fire door by the stairs. Go and unhitch it. I'll try to hold this. Go on, McCrimmon! 
JAMIE: You sure? 
COLONEL: Yes, go on! Go on! 
(Jamie runs back to the fire door as the fungus forces the main door further open.) 
JAMIE: All right, Colonel, come on! 
(Lethbridge-Stewart retreats and the fungus floods inside the Fortress entrance.)

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

DOCTOR: Strange, it's not picking up. The Intelligence must be transmitting. I wonder why it's not working. 
(The Doctor thumps the bench and the sphere starts beeping.) 
Aha! Success! It's going, Anne. 
ANNE: Oh, oh that's marvellous. 
DOCTOR: Come along. 
ANNE: I'm sorry I'm being so long. This is such a fiddling job. 
DOCTOR: Help you in a minute. 
(The Doctor puts the sphere on the floor and it rolls to the door.) 
DOCTOR: There we are. Yes, you see, it's homing. There we are. Fairly strongly 
(Jamie and the Colonel enter.) 
JAMIE: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Careful. Shut the door. 
COLONEL: What? 
ANNE: The sphere. The sphere, it's working. 
JAMIE: Never mind about that. 
DOCTOR: Why, what's happened? 
JAMIE: We tried to get out the surface door, but the fungus is there. 
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not surprised. I thought the Intelligence would try to hem us in. 
COLONEL: Yes, unfortunately it's got into HQ. 
ANNE: What? 
COLONEL: Don't worry. Managed to get a fire door closed. Should hold it. 
ANNE: I hope you're right. 
DOCTOR: Come on, Anne. We must get to work. 
COLONEL: Doctor, tell me, this sphere of yours. Exactly how's it going to help us? 
DOCTOR: Well, the sphere itself, it won't. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
DOCTOR: No. But it will help us to test the control box. 
JAMIE: Is that all? 
DOCTOR: All? 
JAMIE: You mean to say you've wasted all this time, just to 
DOCTOR: Wasted? We haven't been wasting our time. 
JAMIE: Well, I think you have! 
COLONEL: Must agree with the boy, Doctor. You don't seem to have achieved very much. 
ANNE: Colonel, if you left us alone we'd get along a lot quicker. 
COLONEL: Oh, very well. Come on, McCrimmon. We'll leave them to it. 
(The Colonel and Jamie leave.) 
DOCTOR: Right, Anne. Let's get on with this control box.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

COLONEL: Right, let's have a look at this board. 
(Evans appears from behind the door, rifle in hand.) 
COLONEL: Evans, what exactly do you think you're playing at? 
EVANS: Been working it out, I have, see. Come to the conclusion one of you two must be working for this Intelligence. 
JAMIE: Oh, for heaven's sake. 
EVANS: No. It told us it had another pair of hands working for it. Well, I know it's not me, see, so it must be one of you two. Stands to reason, don't it. 
JAMIE: Oh, don't be daft, man. It's Chorley. I've said so all along. 
EVANS: Well, it's only natural you'd say that, ain't it? 
COLONEL: I don't know what you're talking about, Evans, and quite frankly I don't care. Now McCrimmon and I are going out into the tunnels. You'd better join the Doctor and Miss Travers. 
EVANS: If it's all the same to you, sir, I'd prefer to stay here. 
COLONEL: Evans, I gave you an order. 
EVANS: A better position here, sir. Keep an eye on the corridors, I can. Better tactically, don't you think, sir?

[Piccadilly Underground platform]

(Travers is holding Victoria.) 
VICTORIA: Please Professor, let me go. I won't try to escape. Oh, please. 
INTELLIGENCE [OC]: Release her, Professor. As she says, she will not escape. There is nothing for you to be afraid of, child. 
VICTORIA: Isn't there? Where are you? 
INTELLIGENCE [OC]: Nearby. 
VICTORIA: Why don't you show yourself? 
INTELLIGENCE [OC]: All in good time. Travers, you have served your purpose. Awake. 
(Travers collapses.) 
INTELLIGENCE [OC]: Soon you will both see me. 
TRAVERS: What's happened? Where are we? 
VICTORIA: I think you'd better rest for a bit. 
TRAVERS: Rest? No. Work to do. I've got to help the Doctor. Don't run, Victoria, but there's a Yeti over there, on the platform. 
VICTORIA: I know. 
TRAVERS: Yes, well, we'll try and give it the slip. What did you say? 
VICTORIA: I know. That's the one that brought us here. 
TRAVERS: What? Well, come on, Victoria 
(Travers and Victoria back away along the platform, but a second Yeti blocks their escape. Victoria screams.)

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

ANNE: Doctor. Doctor, do hurry. 
DOCTOR: Nearly ready. There. Now then, let's see if it works. 
(The sphere does nothing as the Doctor uses the control box.) 
ANNE: Is it at full power? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ANNE: Then we've failed. 
DOCTOR: Hang on a minute 
(The Doctor moves closer to the sphere. It stops bleeping.) 
DOCTOR: Ah ha! 
ANNE: Oh, it works. 
DOCTOR: Back you come. Yes, the trouble is, it only works at very short range. 
ANNE: But still, that's better than nothing. So now what do we do? 
DOCTOR: Well, we know that your control box can stop a Yeti. Now then, if I can re-programme this sphere to obey our verbal commands. 
ANNE: Yes, but can we do it? I mean, in the time? 
DOCTOR: How long have we got? 
ANNE: Twelve minutes.

[Tunnel junction]

COLONEL: Do we go on or turn back? 
JAMIE: Let's go on. 
COLONEL: Right. Come on. What are you waiting for? 
JAMIE: What made you choose this turning, Colonel? 
COLONEL: What? Well, I don't know really. Why? You're not still thinking about what Evans said, are you? 
JAMIE: Well, he was right about one thing. One of us is working with the Intelligence. 
COLONEL: I can assure you it's not me, McCrimmon. 
JAMIE: Aye, maybe so. 
(Jamie spots something on the rails.) 
JAMIE: Hey, wait a minute! 
(It's a handkerchief.) 
JAMIE: This is Victoria's. We're on the right track.

[Piccadilly Underground platform]

TRAVERS: Anne's all right, you say? 
VICTORIA: Don't worry, Professor. The Doctor's bound to come up with something. 
TRAVERS: I wish I shared your confidence, m'dear. Hello, what's happening? 
(Staff Sergeant Arnold comes out of the tunnel.) 
TRAVERS: Arnold! How'd you get here? I thought Victoria said 
ARNOLD: What, what's happened, sir? 
TRAVERS: Shush! Give me a moment. Do you think you can get to HQ? 
ARNOLD: I'll try, sir. 
TRAVERS: Yeah, well, get hold of the Doctor and tell him where we are. 
ARNOLD: Right, sir. 
TRAVERS: Thank you. 
(Arnold goes back into the tunnel. The Yeti have noticed nothing.) 
VICTORIA: Can't we go with him? 
TRAVERS: No, Victoria. That Yeti's guarding us. If we go, it'll follow. I don't think they've found out about Arnold yet.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

(Evans is lounging in a chair when he hears a beeping noise. The sphere rolls into the room and Evans picks his feet up off the floor, then as it gets closer he stands on the chair and makes to shoot it.) 
DOCTOR: No, don't shoot! 
EVANS: Is that thing on our side, then? 
DOCTOR: It is now. Stop. 
(The sphere stops bleeping.) 
DOCTOR: Were you scared? 
EVANS: Eh? Oh no, no, I mean, I just got up here to get a better aim, that's all. How did you make it stop then? 
DOCTOR: Simple, I told it to. 
EVANS: Here, ball. Why don't you go back where you come from? 
(The sphere stays still.) 
EVANS: Now pull the other one. 
ANNE: Oh, show him, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: All right, I will. Move forward. Stop. Move to the left. Stop. There you are, how about that? 
EVANS: Hey, that's great! Make a smashing toy, that would. 
ANNE: Toy? That's a highly complex piece of equipment. 
EVANS: Oh, is it? Well I don't see how it's going to help us. 
DOCTOR: But it obeys our commands. 
EVANS: So? 
DOCTOR: Well, once we get it inside a Yeti, we'll have a powerful ally. 
EVANS: Inside a Yeti? 
ANNE: Yes, certainly. Will you help us? 
EVANS: You must be joking, Go near one of them things? I may be stupid, but I'm not daft. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Very well, Anne, I shall have to do it myself. 
ANNE: Oh, I'm coming with you, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: No, no, it's far too dangerous. 
EVANS: There you are, what'd I tell you? 
ANNE: Not another word. I'm coming with you.

[Tunnel]

COLONEL: Hold it. 
(A figure is coming towards them.) 
COLONEL: Staff Arnold? It can't be. We'd given you up for lost. 
JAMIE: Easy, easy. That's it. 
ARNOLD: Sorry about this, sir. 
JAMIE: What happened? 
ARNOLD: I don't know. Can't remember. I were pushing the trolley through the fungus, and I blacked out. I thought I were falling. When I come to, sir, I were in the tunnels. Where's the Doctor, sir? I met the Professor and the girl back there and 
JAMIE: Victoria? Is she all right? 
ARNOLD: Yeti guarding them, but I promised I'd tell the Doctor, sir. 
COLONEL: Right. Come on, back to HQ. 
JAMIE: I'm going for Victoria. 
COLONEL: We'd stand a better chance if we stick together. Go ahead. Come on, Staff. Take it easy. 
ARNOLD: Thank you, sir. Right, sir. 
COLONEL: Careful.

[Piccadilly Underground platform]

(Travers checks his watch.) 
TRAVERS: The Doctor's twenty minutes are almost up. 
VICTORIA: Professor? 
(There's a very fast beeping sound, and the Yeti move their captives along the platform.) 
VICTORIA: Where are they taking us? 
TRAVERS: Now keep calm, Victoria. I'm sure the Doctor will think of something.

[Goodge Street Ops room]

(The black line on the map is moving to Warren Street station. There are footsteps outside, so Evans hides.) 
JAMIE: Now, that's it then. 
COLONEL: Evans, come out from behind that board. 
EVANS: Oh, it's you, sir. 
COLONEL: Where's the Doctor? Evans! 
EVANS: B-b-but y-y-you, you 
ARNOLD: Stop bleating like a Welsh baa-lamb, Evans, and answer the Colonel. 
EVANS: Sir? 
COLONEL: Doctor and Miss Travers, where are they? 
EVANS: Gone, sir. 
JAMIE: Gone where? 
EVANS: Warren Street, I think. 
JAMIE: Why? 
EVANS: After a Yeti, they said. 
ARNOLD: Look at the board, sir. Warren Street. 
JAMIE: Come on! 
COLONEL: No, not you, Staff. Evans, make yourself useful. Get a dressing for the Staff Sergeant's head. 
EVANS: Sir. 
ARNOLD: Thank you, sir.

[Tunnel]

(The Doctor is gazing at the wall of fungus blocking their way.) 
DOCTOR: Do you think it's mutating, Anne? 
ANNE: I don't know, but I don't think we'll stay and find out, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: No, perhaps you're right. 
(There is a Yeti behind them.) 
ANNE: We're trapped! 
DOCTOR: Give me the control box, Anne. 
ANNE: The control box. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ANNE: Haven't you got it, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: What? Hold the sphere! 
ANNE: Oh Doctor, you must have it! 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
(The Doctor finds the box in his pocket and tries to use it.) 
ANNE: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Don't worry, it'll work. It's got to work! 
(The Yeti stops right in front of them.) 
ANNE: I know you said it only worked at short range, but for a moment 
DOCTOR: Don't tell me you were worried? Would you like to hold this for me? Now then. It's all right, it's quite safe. 
(The Doctor removes the Yeti's control sphere.) 
Nearly out. There. Right. 
(The Doctor puts their modified sphere into the Yeti.) 
DOCTOR: Now then. Turn round! 
(The Yeti obeys.) 
ANNE: Oh, it works! You've done it. 
DOCTOR: We've done it, you mean. Now then, with my reprogrammed sphere and your control box, we should be able to work him over quite a distance. And put your arm down. 
(The Yeti lowers it's arm.) 
DOCTOR: Now we've got a chance, Anne. Come on. Oh, mustn't forget him. Come on, Fred, at the double.

[Goodge Street Common room]

EVANS: Hold still, can't you? 
ARNOLD: Oh, come on, Evans. Get on with it. 
EVANS: I reckon I ought to have been a doctor. Real professional, that is. 
ARNOLD: All right then, doctor. Take your gear back to the lab. 
EVANS: Oh, right-ho then. 
ARNOLD: And when you've done that, you can come back and shift that chair. 
EVANS [OC]: Staff! Staff! 
ARNOLD: What is it?

[Goodge Street Laboratory]

ARNOLD: What is it, Evans? 
(Evans points to the far wall, which is bulging inwards. Then it gives way.) 
ARNOLD: Come on, Evans, let's get out of it. 
(They retreat as a mass of fungus oozes into the room.)

Episode Six

[Tunnel]

EVANS: What are we going to do now, Staff? 
ARNOLD: The main door should keep the fungus out of the tunnels for a bit. We must warn the others that HQ's had it. 
EVANS: Right. 
ARNOLD: Well, come on, then. 
EVANS: Oh, oh no, not me. 
ARNOLD: You're not disobeying an order, are you, Evans? 
EVANS: Now look here, Staff. If we go up there, and this stuff breaks out, we'll be trapped. 
ARNOLD: Now look, lad, you're scared, that's understandable. But you've been in the Army long enough to know that orders is orders. There's four people up there. If we don't warn them, they're for the chop. 
EVANS: So? Four of them's getting the chop. There's no reason to make it six, is there? 
ARNOLD: I've had enough of your lip for one day. Come on. Follow me. Evans! Come back here! 
EVANS [OC]: Not on your nellie! Cheerio, Staff! 
ARNOLD: Right, then. I'll get you for this!

[Tunnel 2]

DOCTOR: Anne. 
(The Yeti walks past.) 
ANNE: Hey! 
DOCTOR: Stop. Come back here. Stop. Anne, I've been thinking. Until we know who else is working for the Intelligence, everyone must be suspect. 
ANNE: Yes? 
DOCTOR: Well, the fewer people who know this chap's on our side, the better. 
ANNE: Yes. Yes, and whoever is the Intelligence is bound to know that you're controlling this Yeti. 
DOCTOR: I know. You are to remain here for, do you think a minute will be enough? 
ANNE: What for? 
DOCTOR: For us to get clear. 
ANNE: Perhaps. 
DOCTOR: You are to remain here for ninety seconds, and then resume acting on orders from the Intelligence until you are told otherwise. Is that understood? 
(The Yeti roars.) 
DOCTOR: Right. Switch off for ninety seconds starting from now. Come on, Anne.

[Tunnel 3]

JAMIE: It is them. Come on. Am I glad to see you! There's fungus at Warren Street. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. 
JAMIE: Oh. What are you doing down here, anyway? 
DOCTOR: Well, as a matter of fact. I'll tell you another time. Hello, Colonel. 
COLONEL: Glad to see you're both safe. Any luck with your gadgets? 
ANNE: No. No, I'm afraid not. 
COLONEL: Pity. 
DOCTOR: Any news of Victoria? 
JAMIE: Yes, she's at the Piccadilly Station. 
DOCTOR: Piccadilly? 
ANNE: Is my father there too? 
JAMIE: Aye, he's with her. 
DOCTOR: Are they all right? 
COLONEL: Yes. 
DOCTOR: How do you know? 
COLONEL: I ran across Arnold - he saw them. 
DOCTOR: Arnold? 
ANNE: Arnold? But Evans said the fungus 
COLONEL: Yes, he went into it, all right, but he came out again somehow. Says he can't remember what happened. 
DOCTOR: We haven't got any time to find out. 
ANNE: No, time's nearly up. 
COLONEL: Yes, your twenty minutes. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ANNE: Yes. 
COLONEL: Well, come on then. 
ANNE: What are you going to do? 
DOCTOR: We can't do anything until we get back to Headquarters, and then, if we've got time, we'll try and increase the range of the control units. 
ANNE: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Come on. 
(Back along the tunnel, the Doctor's Yeti starts beeping again. After a short while it is joined by two others, and they all move off.) 
DOCTOR: What is it, Colonel? 
COLONEL: Something up ahead. 
ANNE: We can't go back. 
COLONEL: What, fungus, you mean? 
DOCTOR: No. 
ANNE: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ARNOLD [OC]: Is that you, Colonel? 
COLONEL: It's Arnold. Hang on, Staff! 
JAMIE: Why isn't he in HQ? 
ARNOLD: Sir, the fungus, it's swamped HQ. 
JAMIE: No! 
ARNOLD: I'm afraid so, sir. The main doors should keep it out of the tunnels for a bit, but 
COLONEL: Where's Evans? 
ARNOLD: Scarpered, sir. 
(Three Yeti arrive and surround them.) 
ARNOLD: Our time's up! We're all together. They've come to fetch us!

[Tunnel 4]

(Evans hears beeping and hides in an alcove. A Yeti walks past and he comes out, straight into a second one.) 
EVANS: Er, hello. If you're looking for your friend, he went that way. 
(The first Yeti returns.) 
EVANS: Look, you don't want me. I'm not one of them, see? Driver, that's what I am. I shouldn't be down here at all, really. Hey, steady on. Oh, going for a walk, are we? There's lovely. 
(The Yeti carry Evans away.)

[Tunnel junction]

(The Yeti make the group stop.) 
ARNOLD: I'm going to make a break for it, sir. 
COLONEL: Think you can? 
ARNOLD: Well, it's worth a try. On the loose, sir, I might be able to do something. If only you could distract them, sir. 
COLONEL: Right, Staff. 
(The Yeti has got its instructions now.) 
ARNOLD: I think it wants us to go on, sir. 
COLONEL: Right. Here we go. 
(The Colonel stumbles against the Doctor, knocking him down.) 
JAMIE: Wait! Can't you see he's fallen over? 
(Arnold makes his escape in the confusion.)

[Piccadilly ticket hall]

VICTORIA: Where are we being taken, Professor? 
TRAVERS: Oh, to meet the Intelligence, I suppose. 
(A throne-like seat stands in front of the ticket office, linked to a -) 
VICTORIA: A pyramid! 
TRAVERS: Yes, but it's different! We've never seen one like this before. It's fascinating! This must be the machine that the Intelligence intends using on the Doctor. 
VICTORIA: Oh, no, no, no. I shouldn't if I was you. 
TRAVERS: Yes, I think perhaps you're right. 
(There is someone in the shadows.) 
VICTORIA: There's someone there. 
TRAVERS: What? 
VICTORIA: There! 
TRAVERS: Who's there? Who is it? 
(The shadow leaves) 
TRAVERS: Did you see who it was? 
VICTORIA: No. Do you think it could have been 
TRAVERS: The Intelligence? If only we could do something. 
VICTORIA: I'm sure the Doctor will think of something. 
TRAVERS: No, not this time, Victoria. The Doctor would never risk the chance of the Intelligence harming you. 
VICTORIA: You mean he'll just give in? 
TRAVERS: Yes, I'm afraid so. Afraid there's no alternative. 
INTELLIGENCE [OC]: Yes, you're right, Professor. He has no alternative. I am sorry not to be here to welcome you personally, but I am sure you will not be offended. After all, the guest of honour is the Doctor. He, I am sure, will cooperate as I advise you to do. Any attempt to interfere would be pointless. My Yeti can destroy you so easily. 
TRAVERS: It's all my fault. If I hadn't tampered with that sphere. People killed, London invaded, all because of my wretched curiosity. 
VICTORIA: Don't blame yourself, Professor. 
TRAVERS: Why not? I've sacrificed you all, and for what?

[Piccadilly Underground platform]

(The Doctor is playing the first two lines of 'Skye Boat Song' on his recorder, as the Yeti guard the group. The Colonel paces restlessly.) 
JAMIE: Why didn't you tell me all this before? 
DOCTOR: Him. 
JAMIE: You don't think the Colonel? 
DOCTOR: Well, you never know, do you? 
JAMIE: Which one is ours? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: Well, unfortunately I've lost track of him. 
JAMIE: Oh, that's a great help. 
DOCTOR: Well, never mind, I want you to take this microphone and keep on calling our Yeti to you. 
JAMIE: How will I know I've got the right one? 
DOCTOR: You'll soon know if you haven't got the right one, won't you. Jamie, I hope you don't suffer from claustrophobia.

[Tunnel]

(Chorley is hiding in an alcove as Arnold goes past.) 
CHORLEY: Sergeant! Oh, thank heavens I found you. I've been wandering down here by myself for ages. 
ARNOLD: Well, well, well. Quite forgotten about you we had, Mister Chorley. 
CHORLEY: Tried to get out over the surface, but there are Yeti everywhere. And there's this fungus and fog, all around, you see, and it's hopeless! I tried to get back to HQ, I tried, but all the stations were locked, you see, and I couldn't get back in. And all the time I kept seeing more and more Yeti, and they were closing in on me. I was retreating. I was always retreating, and then, at last I found I could get into Piccadilly, but when I got down there, there was this machine and that Professor, and a girl. And more Yeti. They're everywhere! 
ARNOLD: My, my, my. We are in a state, aren't we, sir. 
CHORLEY: Yes. All right. So, I'm frightened. Well so would you be if you'd been up there. 
ARNOLD: It's all right, sir. Nothing to be ashamed of. 
CHORLEY: Yes. 
ARNOLD: There's just one thing that puzzles me though, sir. 
CHORLEY: Oh, what's that? 
ARNOLD: How you managed to exist all this time. Why didn't the Yetis get you? 
CHORLEY: Look, Sergeant, what are you suggesting? You're not suggesting that I 
ARNOLD: Oh no, sir, I was just wondering, that's all. I think perhaps you'd better come along with me, don't you, sir? Come on now.

[Piccadilly Underground platform]

ANNE: Where's the control box? 
DOCTOR: Hmm? 
ANNE: The control box. 
DOCTOR: It's in my pocket. 
ANNE: Well, why don't you use it on these Yeti, and then maybe we can escape. 
DOCTOR: Oh, no. I must meet the Intelligence face to face. 
COLONEL: Doctor? 
DOCTOR: What is it? 
COLONEL: Been thinking. The Yeti haven't noticed McCrimmon's disappearance yet. Not that I think he'll be able to achieve anything. 
DOCTOR: Well, go on. 
COLONEL: Well, I don't really know how to say this, but there's Miss Travers and Victoria to think of, and, er 
DOCTOR: You mean, am I going to give myself up? 
COLONEL: Yes. Of course, the decision must be yours, yours alone. But the Intelligence did promise to release Travers and Victoria. 
DOCTOR: You believe that? 
COLONEL: Well, why not? 
(Anne hears beeps.) 
ANNE: Hello, we've got company. 
(Two Yeti come out of the tunnel carrying Evans, and put him down.) 
EVANS: Hello, sir. 
COLONEL: Evans, where the devil have you been? 
EVANS: Didn't Staff Arnold tell you, sir? 
COLONEL: Yes. Sounded very like desertion to me. 
EVANS: Desertion? Me? Oh, good heavens, no. No, I thought I'd try a single-handed and desperate attempt to rescue Professor Travers and the girl. Isn't Staff Arnold about? 
ANNE: No. 
EVANS: Good. 
(One of the Yeti steps behind the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: Listen. 
(It pushes him up the steps to the ticket hall.) 
DOCTOR: Now listen, everyone. When the Yeti come for you, don't struggle. Whatever you do, don't resist them. 
EVANS: Don't struggle, he says. He must be joking. 
COLONEL: The Doctor will have to give in. There's no other choice. 
EVANS: Aye, aye, time to get fell in. 
(They are moved off along the platform by the Yeti. When all have gone, the lid of a sand bin is lifted and Jamie looks out.)

[Piccadilly Underground corridor]

(A Yeti comes to meet the Doctor and his escort, holding a helmet-like device. It makes to put it on the Doctor's head, then both Yeti stop beeping. The control box has worked. The Doctor takes the device and examines it.) 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
(The Doctor makes some adjustments to the device and gives it back to the Yeti, then switches off the control box again. The Yeti puts the device on the Doctor's head.)

[Piccadilly ticket hall]

ANNE: Father! Oh, Father, are you all right? 
TRAVERS: Yes, I'm all right. Don't worry, Anne. 
VICTORIA: Jamie and the Doctor, where are they? 
TRAVERS: Anne?

[Piccadilly Underground platform]

JAMIE: Yeti? Come towards me. I'm standing beside the platform at Piccadilly Station. Yeti, wherever you are, come towards me. 
(A Yeti comes out of the tunnel.) 
JAMIE: Come towards me. Like that, that's it. Come to. Right now, raise your right arm. Raise your right arm! 
(But the Yeti carries on along the track and into the far tunnel.) 
JAMIE: Oh, what's the use.

[Piccadilly ticket hall]

TRAVERS: Well, there's nothing to be afraid of. Just be calm. 
(The Doctor is brought in wearing the helmet device.) 
VICTORIA: Doctor! 
TRAVERS: The Doctor! 
ANNE: Doctor! 
VICTORIA: What are they going to do? 
DOCTOR: Now don't worry, Victoria. 
VICTORIA: Oh, but 
DOCTOR: Everything's under control. Don't be frightened. 
VICTORIA: But Doctor, what are they going to do? 
DOCTOR: Everything is under control. Tell her, Anne. You understand. 
ANNE: Yes, yes, I think so. 
DOCTOR: Now listen, everyone. Don't do anything foolish! I am perfectly all right. 
INTELLIGENCE [OC]: Yes, he is perfectly all right. Thank you, Doctor, for being so cooperative. 
COLONEL: Why don't you show yourself? Who are you? 
INTELLIGENCE [OC]: Silence. You will know soon enough. 
(Chorley enters with a Yeti.) 
VICTORIA: Chorley? 
COLONEL: Chorley? 
TRAVERS: Good grief. 
ANNE: That horrible little man? 
EVANS: You, the Intelligence? 
ANNE: No.! 
COLONEL: No, he can't be the Intelligence. He can't be. It doesn't make sense. 
(CHORLEY, having recovered his breath, is flustered and close to tears. He turns and points down the passageway.) 
CHORLEY: It isn't me. It isn't me. Don't you understand? I'm not the Intelligence. The Intelligence is him! 
(Arnold comes out of the shadows.) 
TRAVERS: It can't be! 
ANNE: Oh, it's too horrible. I don't believe it! 
(Arnold's face is blank.) 
ANNE: Arnold. 
ARNOLD: (no accent) No, merely Arnold's lifeless body in which I have concealed myself. But let us to work. There will be time for discussion later. In fact, all the time in the world. 
ANNE: Oh, so you weren't going to let us go then afterwards. 
TRAVERS: Did you think he would? 
ARNOLD: The last member of the party. Come and join us. 
(A Yeti brings Jamie in.) 
VICTORIA: Oh, Jamie! 
JAMIE: Victoria, are you all right? 
VICTORIA: Yes. 
ARNOLD: Your solicitude is touching. Nevertheless, it is wasting time. 
DOCTOR: Frightened that something might go wrong? 
ARNOLD: Join the Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Do what he says, Jamie. 
ARNOLD: Take him! 
(A Yeti grabs Jamie around the neck.) 
ARNOLD: I must ensure your complete cooperation, Doctor. Should you prove at all unhelpful, your young friend's neck will be broken. 
DOCTOR: You gave your word that no one would be harmed. I refuse to submit until you release Jamie! 
ARNOLD: All right. Release the boy. But at the first sign of trouble from you 
DOCTOR: Don't worry. I will do what you say. 
ARNOLD: Good. Into the machine, Doctor. 
(The Doctor steps into the pyramid.) 
TRAVERS: What's he going to do? 
COLONEL: What's happening? 
(There is a chair under a mass of circuitry. The Doctor sits in it. Arnold makes some adjustments then lowers a metal circlet onto the helmet the Doctor is wearing.) 
ARNOLD: Soon your mind will be absorbed by the Great Intelligence. You should be very proud, Doctor. Your knowledge of the past will help to shape the future of this planet. 
DOCTOR: Just get on with it, please. 
ARNOLD: You seem very anxious suddenly. 
DOCTOR: I just want it over and done with. 
ARNOLD: Submission is essential. You must understand, Doctor, that without your complete cooperation this transference would be of no value. Should you offer any opposition, either physical or mental, I shall be forced to punish you, or rather your friends. Prepare for a great darkness to cloud your mind. 
JAMIE: Attack now! Attack the Yeti! 
(The tame Yeti turns on the other Yeti.) 
JAMIE: Get Arnold! 
(It attacks Arnold.) 
DOCTOR: No! 
COLONEL: Get the Doctor out! 
(The Doctor shakes off attempts to rescue him.) 
DOCTOR: No, you don't understand. You'll ruin everything! No! 
JAMIE: Professor! Anne! Give us some help! 
DOCTOR: No! No! No! Leave me be! You don't understand. I've got to stay here! 
(Evans and the Colonel pull the Doctor out of the pyramid and Jamie throws the headset into it. BOOM! The Yeti all collapse.) 
EVANS: Well, that's that then, innit? 
DOCTOR: You blithering Welsh imbecile! Why can't you do what you're told! 
JAMIE: Hey, now just a minute, Doctor. If we hadn't pulled you out of that, you'd have been a heap of dust by now. 
DOCTOR: You're just as bad. I told you to leave it to me! Now you've gone and ruined everything. 
JAMIE: Ruined everything? How can we? We we've won, haven't we? 
DOCTOR: No! 
TRAVERS: What do you mean, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Oh, why didn't they leave it to me? I had crossed those wires on that helmet thing. The Intelligence wouldn't have drained me, I would have drained the Intelligence! As it is, all we got was a crossed circuit. 
ANNE: You mean, all we've done is cut off its contact with Earth? It's still out there in space somewhere, flying around? 
DOCTOR: Precisely! Look. 
(Arnold lies dead, a charred husk.) 
VICTORIA: Oh! 
CHORLEY: Oh, poor fellow! 
COLONEL: Do you mean to say that Arnold wasn't the Intelligence? 
DOCTOR: No. He was just a poor soldier that was taken over. He was probably one of the first to disappear. 
EVANS: You mean it might come back? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's still around, isn't it? I've failed. 
TRAVERS: Nonsense, man. 
ANNE: You were marvellous. 
COLONEL: Yes. Great victory. 
DOCTOR: I doubt it. 
ANNE: No, you were a hero, and you know it. 
DOCTOR: You don't really think so, do you. 
ANNE: Yes, yes,. I do. 
CHORLEY: You've got to face facts, old man. By tomorrow morning you're going to be a household word, a national figure. 
DOCTOR: Oh, no. Oh, no. 
CHORLEY: Yes. I want you on my television programme, and 
DOCTOR: Oh, no! 
CHORLEY: and I want to organise a big press conference, and 
DOCTOR: Jamie! Victoria! Come along, it's time we left. 
CHORLEY: But the press conference, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Goodbye! 
TRAVERS: But Doctor? Doctor, you can't go yet. There are a lot of things I want to discuss with you. 
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Travers, we have to go. 
CHORLEY: Where are you going? 
DOCTOR: Covent Garden. Come along. Come along, Jamie. Goodbye, Travers. 
TRAVERS: Goodbye Victoria, dear. Goodbye. Goodbye. 
(The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria disappear down to the platform.) 
ANNE: Where's he going? 
TRAVERS: Oh, er, back to his Tardis, I suppose. 
CHORLEY: You mean this, uh, this time machine thing, it really exists? 
TRAVERS: Well, I, er. Oh, explain it to him, Anne, will you? Colonel, I think we'd better check up top, don't you? 
COLONEL: Right, Professor. Evans! 
ANNE: Father? Father, I 
CHORLEY: Now don't you go, Miss Travers. I'd like you to explain all about this time machine for me. 
ANNE: Oh, dear.

[Tunnel junction]

DOCTOR: Well, where do we go? Which is the way to Covent Garden? 
JAMIE: Oh, don't ask me. I've completely lost my bearings. 
VICTORIA: All these tunnels look the same to me. 
DOCTOR: Come on, let's try this way. 
JAMIE: Well, it doesn't matter, anyway. I mean, there's no danger, is there? 
DOCTOR: Well, not from the Yeti, no, but who knows, they might suddenly start the trains again! Come on! 
JAMIE: Trains? 
VICTORIA: Oh! 
JAMIE: Come on!

[Beach]

(The Tardis has materialised in mid-air just offshore, and set itself down gently on the water. The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria use a rubber dinghy to row to the shingle beach nearby.) 
DOCTOR: There. Come one, Victoria, out you get. 
JAMIE: Trust you to bring us right down in the middle of the sea. 
DOCTOR: The Tardis is perfectly capable of floating you know. 
VICTORIA: Where are we exactly? 
DOCTOR: Oh England, undoubtedly. 
JAMIE: Aye, you can tell by the weather. 
DOCTOR: And the white cliffs. 
VICTORIA: We always seem to land on this planet. 
JAMIE: Aye, it's always England. I think by the hammering the Tardis has got, you've gone and spiked it. Hey, where are you going? 
(Something further along the beach has caught the Doctor's attention.) 
JAMIE: Hey what's all this stuff Doctor? 
VICTORIA: Foam, you silly. You often get it on the sea shore. 
JAMIE: Aye, but not in big lumps like this, hey Doctor? 
DOCTOR: No, not usually, Jamie. (He scoops some up.) Hey Jamie, feel that. 
(The Doctor pushes the foam into Jamie's face.) 
JAMIE: Right. 
(And the three have a foam fight up the beach. Then Jamie sees something further along.) 
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, what's that? May be that's where the foam's coming from. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I hardly think so, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Well, let's go and see. 
(They come to a large steel pipe which curves up out of the sand and into the face of the cliff.)
JAMIE: What is it? 
DOCTOR: It's just what it says, Jamie. It's EuroSea Gas. 
JAMIE: Gas from the sea? Oh, who are you trying to kid? 
VICTORIA: So it's nothing to do with the foam then. 
DOCTOR: No, no, I shouldn't think so. I wonder what that is? 
(The Doctor peers at a large black metal box fastened to the pipe, then tries to open it.) 
JAMIE: Will it not budge? 
DOCTOR: No, it won't touch it, I'm afraid, Jamie. Ah well, have to use this. 
JAMIE: What's that? 
DOCTOR: It's a sonic screwdriver. Never fails. 
(The Doctor activates the wand-like device and the screws unwind themselves out of the box.) 
DOCTOR: There we are. Neat isn't it? All done by sound waves. Now, what have we got here. Oh yes. 
JAMIE: What is it? What's that noise? 
DOCTOR: I don't know, Jamie. 
(The Doctor closes the box, gets a stethoscope from his pockets and listens to the pipe. It sounds like a heart beat.) 
VICTORIA: I can hear it too. 
DOCTOR: Yes. It's probably only throbbing from a pump, you know. 
VICTORIA: Doctor, please hurry up. I don't like this place. It's so quiet. I feel as if we're being watched. 
DOCTOR: All right, Victoria. Now then, Jamie. 
(They are being watched, through the telescopic sight of a remotely controlled rifle which is relaying the image to a television screen. The rifle moves to put its cross-hairs on the Doctor. The Doctor is shot in the shoulder, and falls.) 
VICTORIA: Doctor! 
(Jamie and Victoria are also shot.)

[Control hall]

(Victoria wakes. She is lying on the floor of a brightly lit room with two armed guards standing over her.) 
VICTORIA: Doctor? Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Victoria? Jamie, you there? 
JAMIE: Oh, I think so. 
VICTORIA: I can't move. My legs. 
JAMIE: What happened?? What do you want? 
DOCTOR: Would someone kindly tell us where we are, please? Why don't you answer? 
JAMIE: Come on, where are we? 
VICTORIA: What have they done? Can't move. 
DOCTOR: I think we've been tranquillised, Victoria. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
DOCTOR: Tranquillised. 
JAMIE: Who do they think they are? 
ROBSON: We should be the ones asking the questions. I shall expect quite a lot of answers. 
JAMIE: What is this place? 
ROBSON: You mean you don't know? 
JAMIE: If only I could just get up. 
ROBSON: I wouldn't try if I were you. 
DOCTOR: You know, in this position it's just a little difficult to communicate. 
HARRIS: Shall we give them some U4, sir? 
DOCTOR: Eh? 
ROBSON: Yes, do that Mister Harris. 
JAMIE: What's U4? 
VICTORIA: Oh no. 
DOCTOR: I think it's all right, I think it's the antidote. 
VICTORIA: No, please. 
DOCTOR: Anyway, there's nothing we can do about it, you know. Oh yes, thank you. Yes, that's better, thank you. Thank you very much. Yes. 
(Revived by the antidote gas, the travellers stand.) 
ROBSON: You were on the beach by the pipe line, in a restricted area. Now why? 
VICTORIA: We were lost, that's all. 
ROBSON: You were tampering with the emergency release valve remote control. You're a saboteur. 
VICTORIA: He's not. He's a doctor. 
DOCTOR: I can assure you. I was only being curious. 
HARRIS: I don't really think how they could have anything to do with the fall in pressure 
ROBSON: When I want your opinion, Harris, I'll ask for it. In the meantime, lock them up in one of the cabins. I'll interrogate them later. And you lot, get back to work. 
JAMIE: Is he always as charming as that? 
HARRIS: We're in something of an emergency at the moment. You see, we've just lost contact with one of our rigs at sea. 
DOCTOR: You mean communications have broken down? 
HARRIS: No, that's what's curious about it. As far as we can tell our video link is functioning normally. The crew just aren't answering. 
VICTORIA: You can't blame us for that, surely. 
HARRIS: There's also been a drop in pressure in the feed lines from the rigs. You were seen tampering with a release valve on the pipe line. 
DOCTOR: I told you I was merely being curious. 
HARRIS: Were you? 
JAMIE: Are you calling us liars? 
HARRIS: No, but you must admit your sudden appearance here inside our restricted area is suspicious. 
VICTORIA: That's no reason to shoot us down like animals. 
HARRIS: Maybe not, but we were under a security alert and Mister Robson's, well. under considerable pressure himself. I'm sorry but I shall have to do as he says and lock you up. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear. 
HARRIS: Would you follow me? Come along, this way. 
(Harris leads the way and the two armed guards follow. A warning light starts to glow on a control panel.)

[Compound entrance]

(Harris's wife is stopped from leaving.) 
GUARD: May I see your pass please, madam? 
MAGGIE: Pass? 
GUARD: I have instructions that no one is to leave or enter the compound without a written pass from Chief Robson. Not until after the emergency. 
MAGGIE: But you know who I am. My husband is second in command to Chief Robson. 
GUARD: Yes Mrs Harris, I know. 
MAGGIE: Then let me pass. Please. 
GUARD: Sorry, madam. I think you should return to the residential block.

[Crew bunk room]

HARRIS: I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do to help you until you tell me what you were doing with that release valve on the pipe line. 
DOCTOR: It wasn't the valve I was interested in. 
HARRIS: Oh? 
DOCTOR: I heard a movement coming from inside the pipes. 
HARRIS: A movement? (to guard) Oh, it's all right. You can go. 
DOCTOR: Yes, movement. Don't ask me what it was. 
HARRIS: Well, I'm not sure what you re trying to suggest, but I can assure you marine life couldn't possibly get inside the pipe line tube. It would never get pass the drill pumps. 
JAMIE: Aye, that's as maybe, but there was something inside that tube because I heard it too. 
VICTORIA: And so did I. 
DOCTOR: But if the pressure is down in the pipes, perhaps that's the reason why? Perhaps marine life has got into the pipes. 
HARRIS: But that's impossible. We spent years of time, money and research into perfecting our emergency system. 
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps there's a fracture in the pipes. A break, and something's got in that way. 
HARRIS: Oh, I doubt it. 
DOCTOR: Mister Harris, I don't wish to appear interfering but don't you think it'd be a good idea to turn off the gas? At least until you've had a chance to check. 
HARRIS: Chief Robson would never agree to that. 
DOCTOR: Why not? 
HARRIS: Well, he doesn't believe in working to the book. He prides himself that the flow has never been shut off ever since he took charge. 
DOCTOR: He sounds a very silly man. 
HARRIS: But he appears to be right about one thing. You seem to know quite a lot about our business.

[Control hall]

PRICE: Chief? 
ROBSON: Yes? 
PRICE: We've gained contact with Rig D. Come in, Rig D. Come in, please. Rig D, can you hear me please? 
(There is interference on the signal.) 
CARNEY [on monitor]: Yes. Rig D to HQ. I can hear you. 
ROBSON: Carney? What the dickens is going on out there? 
CARNEY [on monitor]: Everything's quite all right, Mister Robson. 
ROBSON: What? 
CARNEY [on monitor]: We have the situation under control. 
ROBSON: Will you speak up, man. I can't hear a word you're saying. 
CARNEY [on monitor]: Don't worry. 
ROBSON: Price, are we losing volume? 
PRICE: No, sir. I don't understand it. Will you speak a little louder, Mister Carney? 
CARNEY [on monitor]: Everything is under control. 
ROBSON: Carney? What happened to the emergency crew we sent you? Have they arrived yet? 
CARNEY [on monitor]: Yes. Yes. But they must stay here for the time being. 
ROBSON: They what? 
CARNEY [on monitor]: We've had a slight accident. Two men out of action. 
ROBSON: Now listen, Carney. You get that rig fixed A1 and quick. 
CARNEY [on monitor]: But it will take some time. 
ROBSON: What? What did you say? What's wrong with this thing. 
PRICE: I don't know, sir. It must be their end. He seems to be whispering. 
CARNEY [on monitor]: Everything's under control. 
ROBSON: Carney, speak up man! 
CARNEY [on monitor]: Everything's under control. 
ROBSON: Carney! 
CARNEY [on monitor]: Everything's under control. 
ROBSON: Carney! 
PRICE: I think we've lost contact again, sir. 
ROBSON: Well fix it, man. 
(Harris enters.) 
ROBSON: Price is getting too old for his job. 
HARRIS: Mister Robson, I think we should turn off the gas flow coming from the rigs and make a check. 
ROBSON: You think what, Mister Harris? 
HARRIS: That Doctor chap, the stranger. He said he heard a movement coming from inside the pipe line on the beach. 
ROBSON: Oh, did he now. Did he say what he thought it was? Mice? 
CHIEF: Chief? She's down a further three. Pressure's on just one fifty seven. 
ROBSON: One fifty seven? Are you sure? 
CHIEF: Yes, sir. 
HARRIS: That means the gas flow pressure is down at the rate of three percent every 
CHIEF: Twenty minutes. 
HARRIS: Doesn't this prove that something must be blocking the pipe line? 
ROBSON: It proves nothing of the sort. It's probably a faulty gauge, that's all. Check it. 
HARRIS: Look, at least give us the benefit of the doubt. 
ROBSON: When you want to find out about pipe lines and rigs Mister Harris, the thing to do is to go out to sea and work on them. 
HARRIS: Look, I'm merely saying that if something had got into the tube then we should check 
ROBSON: You let me worry about that. 
HARRIS: But Mister Robson, please listen. Look, this ties up with what I've been trying to tell you. For three weeks now, there's been a regular and increasing build up of fall in pressure. Look, I think you should at least look at my calculations. The time ratio of the increases and falls corresponds to form a definite progressive pattern. 
ROBSON: So? 
HARRIS: I'll get them. 
(There is an open briefcase nearby.) 
ROBSON: What are you trying to prove, Harris? That I don't know my job? 
HARRIS: No, sir, just that I do know mine. It's your decision whether to take notice of my work but I must put it on record that I have offered the information. 
(A white gloved hand takes some papers from the briefcase.) 
ROBSON: Don't threaten me, boy. I've eaten upstarts like you for breakfast. You think you can baffle me with your little bits of paper, don't you. All right, you go ahead and get them and I'll show you where you've gone wrong. 
(Harris goes to get the file.) 
ROBSON: Did you make a thorough check? 
CHIEF: Yes, I checked it. Seems to be working properly. 
HARRIS: It's gone. 
CHIEF: Doesn't seem to be anything wrong with her. 
HARRIS: It's gone. The file's gone. 
ROBSON: Well, well, well. Has it now. 
HARRIS: I'm sure I put it in here this morning. I must have left the file on my desk at home. I'll go home and get it. 
ROBSON: You won't. You'll stay here. I'm not doing your job as well as my own. 
HARRIS: What's the matter, sir? Are you scared that I might prove you wrong? 
ROBSON: No, you go ahead. But you'd better have something more than a high flown theory, because if you haven't I'm going to take you and chop you up into little pieces and throw you back to your crummy little university. All right?

[Crew bunk room]

(Jamie is standing on the Doctor's shoulders.) 
DOCTOR: I've got it. 
(He passes down a grille taken from an opening above the door.) 
DOCTOR: Can you see anyone? 
JAMIE: All clear. 
DOCTOR: Do you think you can make it? 
JAMIE: Of course I can make it. Hold on. 
VICTORIA: Don't bother, Jamie. I can do it with this. 
JAMIE: Pick a lock with A hair pin? Don't be daft. 
(Jamie slips. The Doctor cries out in pain.) 
VICTORIA: Clumsy. 
(Victoria works on the lock as Jamie sticks his head out into the corridor.)

[Refinery corridor]

HARRIS: Maggie, where have you been? I've been trying to contact you. 
MAGGIE: I was on my way to the village but Robson's clamped down on security. I'm just coming to find you to get a pass. 
HARRIS: Yes, there's been a bit of a flap on. 
MAGGIE: Well can I have a pass? 
HARRIS: Not at the moment. Look, could you do something for me? 
MAGGIE: Yes, what is it? 
HARRIS: There's a file. It's probably in the middle drawer of my desk in the study. Could you get it and bring it to me at the control room? 
MAGGIE: All right, darling. What's the panic? 
HARRIS: I'll explain later. Don't be long. 
MAGGIE: All right, darling. 
(Maggie watches Harris leave, then heads off.)

[Crew bunk room]

(Jamie stopped trying to get through the grille because the previous scene was right outside their door.) 
VICTORIA: Oh, he's stuck. 
DOCTOR: No, he's not. Are you ready, Jamie? 
JAMIE: Yeah. 
DOCTOR: Right. 
(The Doctor gives Jamie a huge shove, and he falls through the grille into the corridor. Then the door opens.) 
VICTORIA: Told you not to bother. 
DOCTOR: Sorry about that, Jamie.

[Harrises' quarters]

(Maggie looks for her husband's file in the study. It's a mess.) 
MAGGIE: Typical. 
(She finds the file in a different drawer than Harris said. It has something inside it. Maggie opens it and drops it when she is stung.) 
MAGGIE: Seaweed? 
(She carefully picks up the file and the seaweed, then goes to the garden door and throws the seaweed onto the patio. Unnoticed, the seaweed bubbles and writhes.)

[Impeller room]

VAN LUTYENS: (Dutch) Mister Robson? Mister Robson? Could I speak with you please? 
ROBSON: van Lutyens. I thought you were out at the control rig. 
VAN LUTYENS: I just got back on the supply boat. 
ROBSON: Something wrong? 
VAN LUTYENS: I'm not quite sure. The men out there seem very restless. 
ROBSON: Restless? What are you talking about? 
VAN LUTYENS: You lost contact with Rig D, didn't you? 
ROBSON: Yes. It was only a temporary fault. We regained contact within the hour. 
VAN LUTYENS: Well, why didn't you tell us that? Unusual incidents like that only cause tension on the rigs. 
ROBSON: Don't tell me what happened out on the rigs. I spent four years on one of those things without a break. 
VAN LUTYENS: Then you should know better than anyone how important it is to keep up the morale of the crews. 
ROBSON: What do you want me to do, wipe their noses for them? Mind your own business, Van Lutyens. 
VAN LUTYENS: Mister Robson. I think you're forgetting we also have an interest in EuroSea Gas.

[Control hall]

ROBSON: We? 
VAN LUTYENS: I'm here for the Dutch Government, not for myself. 
ROBSON: You're here to offer me your expert advice, not to spread alarm amongst my crews. 
VAN LUTYENS: How dare you say that to me? 
ROBSON: I didn't ask you to come here. It was Megan Jones and those fools on the board. I said it wouldn't work and it never has. 
VAN LUTYENS: Only because you are too proud to accept advice. 
ROBSON: Let's get one thing straight, my friend. When I need your advice I'll ask for it. 
(Robson walks away.) 
VAN LUTYENS: U stomme pompouze idiot Engelsman.

[Control hall walkway]

(From the walkway above the control hall, the Doctor, Jamie and Victoria watch van Lutyens leave.) 
JAMIE: What was all that? 
DOCTOR: I think he's Dutch, Jamie, and I don't think he likes the English very much. 
(The Doctor gestures Jamie to keep quiet as Price answers an incoming call.)

[Control hall]

PRICE: Control. 
BAXTER [OC]: Chief Baxter, Control Rig. Is Mister Robson there? 
PRICE: Yes, sir. Mister Robson, sir. 
ROBSON: Yes? 
PRICE: Chief Baxter, Control Rig, sir. 
ROBSON: Right. Yes, Baxter, what is it? 
BAXTER [OC]: Has Mister Lutyens arrive there yet, sir? 
ROBSON: Yes. Why? 
BAXTER [OC]: Then he'll have told you how the men feel, sir. 
ROBSON: Now listen, Baxter. I'm in charge of this outfit, not van Lutyens. You take orders from me not him. 
BAXTER [OC]: Yes, sir. But there's something else. 
ROBSON: What else? 
BAXTER [OC]: Something seems to have got inside the pipe line. 
ROBSON: Inside the pipe line? 
BAXTER [OC]: We've all heard it. 
ROBSON: Heard what? 
BAXTER [OC]: This sound. At first I thought it was something to do with the pumps but it isn't. It's a peculiar sound. A sort of regular thumping, pulsating, like a heart beat.

[Control hall walkway]

DOCTOR: That's the noise I heard on the beach. 
VICTORIA: What is it, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I don't know but we're going to find out. Come on, Jamie. Oh Victoria, no. Not you. 
VICTORIA: Why not? 
DOCTOR: I think it'd be better if you stayed back in the bunk room. Please. 
VICTORIA: Oh, all right. 
JAMIE: Oh, and Victoria? 
VICTORIA: Yes? 
(Jamie laughs. Victoria reluctantly goes back towards the bunk room, but as soon as Jamie and the Doctor are out of sight she turns around and goes exploring.)

[Harrises' quarters]

(Maggie is feeling ill after being stung by the seaweed. She goes to the videophone.) 
PRICE [on monitor]: Control. 
MAGGIE: Mrs Harris here, married block 420. Could I speak to my husband please?

[Control hall]

ROBSON: Have you recalibrated? 
PRICE: I've just done phase two. 
ROBSON: Better start on phase three. 
HARRIS: Mister Robson. 
ROBSON: Yes, Harris. Where are your figures? 
HARRIS: Oh I haven't got them, sir. I sent my wife for them, but she's not well. I wondered if I could go and 
ROBSON: No I would not. Tell her to call a doctor, not pester you. 
HARRIS: But Doctor Patterson is still out at Rig D, sir. 
ROBSON: Well, tell her to get one in from the outside. 
HARRIS: But you've still go the compound on full emergency alert, remember? 
ROBSON: All right. But make it quick.

[Oxygen store room]

(Nearby, in an oxygen cylinder store room, a person in white gloves and gas mask is adjusting valves and allowing the contents to leak out. He stops when he hears someone outside. It is Victoria, creeping along the corridor. She hears someone approaching and goes through the nearest door. The oxygen-rich atmosphere is stifling, so Victoria starts closing the valves. She hears a sound behind her and sees the tall thin man in the gas mask leave. He locks her in.) 
VICTORIA: Oh, well. 
(Victoria unpins her hair and starts to pick the lock. Outside, the mystery man activates the emergency ventilator control then leaves. There is a hum, and a metal grill in the wall opens.)

[Impeller room]

(Next to the Control hall. There is a large cylindrical machine and next to it an airlock to a lift shaft which goes down into the ground.) 
JAMIE: What's that thing supposed to do? 
DOCTOR: It's an impeller, Jamie. It pumps gas from the main pipe line out at sea. Come on.

[Pipeline room]

(Next door is a massive room full of pipes and pressure gauges. It has a raised observation platform at one end.) 
JAMIE: Is this the pipeline, then? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, they all are. It's a continuation of the pipe we found on the beach. 
JAMIE: That bit there, you can see inside the pipe. 
DOCTOR: Yes, It's transparent for checking condensation, and anything else that might get inside.

[Oxygen store]

(Victoria's lock picking skills have failed her. She thumps on the door instead.) 
VICTORIA: Hello? Is anybody there? Oh, come on. 
(There's a strange bubbling noise coming from the far side of the room. A mass of foam comes out of the ventilator grille. Victoria sees something moving within the foam.)

[Pipeline room]

(The Doctor is using his stethoscope on the main pipe.) 
DOCTOR: There it is again, Jamie. Can you hear it? 
JAMIE: Aye. What is it? 
DOCTOR: Your guess is as good as mine. There's something inside there. 
VICTORIA [OC]: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Victoria! Come on!

[Refinery corridor]

VICTORIA: Jamie! 
(Victoria's cries can be heard echoing all around the pipes and corridors.) 
VICTORIA: Help! 
DOCTOR: Victoria, where are you? 
VICTORIA [OC]: Doctor! Jamie! Help!

[Oxygen store]

(Tendrils of seaweed come through the vents, reaching for Victoria. She screams.)

Episode Two

[Refinery corridor]

DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie. 
JAMIE: In here! 
DOCTOR: I can smell gas! 
(The Doctor and Jamie force open the oxygen storeroom door and pull Victoria out into the corridor.) 
DOCTOR: Here you are. 
(Robson, Van Lutyens and the Chief engineer enter.) 
JAMIE: What happened? 
DOCTOR: Deep breaths. Take deep breaths. 
CHIEF: Mister Robson, in here. Gas. 
ROBSON: Check it then. Find out what it is. 
VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor, a horrible creature. 
DOCTOR: Creature? 
VICTORIA: Didn't you see it? It was in there. It came straight towards me covered with seaweed and foam and this horrible hissing sound, and then I screamed. I didn't know. 
DOCTOR: All right, Victoria. 
ROBSON: Creature? The girl's hysterical. 
CHIEF: Mister Robson? They're empty. The seals are broken. 
ROBSON: Why were you in there? 
VICTORIA: I was hiding. I heard someone coming so I went in. 
ROBSON: This door is always kept locked. You broke in. You emptied those cylinders, didn't you. 
VICTORIA: Oh, no, no. It was open and someone locked it behind me. 
JAMIE: She's telling the truth. The door was locked from the outside. 
VAN LUTYENS [OC]: Mister Robson. 
DOCTOR: Yes, it was locked. 
VAN LUTYENS: This room wasn't full of oxygen when we came in here. It was another gas of a toxic composition. 
ROBSON: All right, if it was a poison gas, where did it come from? 
CHIEF: What about up there? 
VAN LUTYENS: The ventilator's open. Good. Did you open the ventilator? 
VICTORIA: No, it opened by its self. 
JAMIE: Then whoever locked you in must have opened it. But how? 
VAN LUTYENS: From here. 
(Van Lutyens points to the ventilator control panel.)

[Harrises' quarters]

HARRIS: What is it, love? 
MAGGIE: I don't know. I feel so dazed. And my hand. 
HARRIS: Let me see. It looks all right. What happened? 
MAGGIE: I don't remember. 
HARRIS: You said you were stung or something. 
MAGGIE: Did I? Why, I don't. Yes, yes it must have been. I went to get the file you asked for, put my hand inside and then. The seaweed. 
HARRIS: All right, my love. Lie still and rest. Shall I get you some food, a glass of milk or something? 
MAGGIE: Darling, you couldn't even boil an egg. 
HARRIS: You shouldn't have married a scientist then. 
(Maggie gasps for breath.) 
HARRIS: Maggie! 
MAGGIE: Darling. Darling. Darling.
HARRIS: Maggie! 
(Out on the patio, the discarded seaweed is surrounded by a mass of foam which pops and hisses as Maggie becomes more agitated.) 
HARRIS: What is it, love? What's the matter? 
MAGGIE: I don't know. I just feel 
HARRIS: I'd better get you a doctor. I'll go back and see if Doctor Patterson's returned yet from Rig D. Will you be all right? 
MAGGIE: I think so. 
HARRIS: Well if he isn't back, there's this other doctor. He might be able to help. I won't be long. 
(Harris leaves. Maggie lies staring at the ceiling for a few moments, but the pounding gets louder in her head. She gets up and goes to the study, then to the patio door. She hesitates then opens it and stares at the weed. Suddenly she slams the door shut and stares at the floor in confusion.)

[Impeller room]

ROBSON: So what's the panic? 
CHIEF: It's the pump, sir. The revs have dropped. 
VAN LUTYENS: The pump is slowing down? 
CHIEF: Yes, she's not holding steady even now. I don't understand it. 
ROBSON: Well, don't stand there thinking about it, man. Do a complete check. 
DOCTOR: Excuse me, may I say something? When I was in the pipe room a short while ago, I'm sure I heard a movement coming from inside the pipe. 
VAN LUTYENS: What kind of movement? 
DOCTOR: Well, the same as I heard on the beach. A sort of thumping sound. 
VAN LUTYENS: But that's what they heard out at the rigs. 
ROBSON: What you heard and what everybody else heard was a mechanical fault somewhere along the line. 
DOCTOR: Then why did they hear it out at the rigs? 
ROBSON: Because, my friend, underneath this impeller shaft is a vast steel gasometer buried in the earth. It acts like an echo chamber. It'll make the sound of a pin dropping sound like that of a thunder clap. It travels along the pipe. 
DOCTOR: Oh, this wasn't a mechanical sound. 
ROBSON: All right then, suppose there is something in the pipe. A fish or something. What do you expect me to do about it? 
DOCTOR: Turn off the gas flow. At least until you've had a chance to investigate. 
ROBSON: That's out of the question. 
VAN LUTYENS: Mister Robson, if there is something in the pipeline 
ROBSON: We do not turn off the flow and that is final. 
CHIEF: Mister Robson, sir. 
ROBSON: Yes? 
CHIEF: Down another half. 
ROBSON: It must be a mechanical fault. Get a couple of men and check, man, check. 
VAN LUTYENS: If you allow the pressure to build up in the pipeline, you'll blow the whole rig sky-high. 
DOCTOR: And blow us with it. 
VAN LUTYENS: All because you're too stubborn to turn off the gas. 
ROBSON: All right, what do you think it is? One of these creatures the hysterical girl thought she saw? 
DOCTOR: Well, who knows.

[Control hall]

JAMIE: You mean to say that this place supplies all the gas for the whole of the south of England? 
PRICE: And the whole of Wales. 
VICTORIA: What are all those lights for? 
PRICE: Well, that's a plan of the entire compound and each of those lights represents a remote control camera that I can switch through to this screen if I want to look at any particular area. Like this. 
JAMIE: Oh. Where are all these rigs people talk about? 
PRICE: Well, they're out at sea, of course, but that plan over there shows you the relative position of all the rigs under our command. 
VICTORIA: What's the big one in the middle? 
PRICE: Well that's the central control rig complex, the sort of the nerve centre of the whole thing. The other rigs feed her with gas and she in turn pumps it to us via the main pipeline, see. 
VICTORIA: How awful to have to live out at sea. And lonely. 
PRICE: Oh, I don't know. Mister Robson once spent four years on one of the early rigs without ever going ashore. 
JAMIE: Aye, that would account for quite a lot. 
VICTORIA: Jamie! 
ROBSON: Hey, you. Come in here and give a hand. 
JAMIE: Doesn't that man ever call anyone by their name? 
PRICE: Well, it probably means trouble if he does. No, he's all right, is Robson. Certainly knows all there is to know about rigs, anyway. 
HARRIS: Price! Has Doctor Patterson returned from Rig D yet? 
PRICE: No, sir. 
HARRIS: Where's your friend, the Doctor? 
JAMIE: In there.

[Impeller room]

HARRIS: Doctor! Doctor, I need your help. It's my wife, she's very ill. 
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not sure that I 
HARRIS: You must come. 
ROBSON: He will not go with you. 
HARRIS: This is an emergency. It's my wife. 
ROBSON: These people are in my custody until I decide what to do with them. 
HARRIS: But my wife! 
ROBSON: Don't bring your domestic affairs into the refinery, Harris. That goes for the rest of you. 
HARRIS: Mister Robson, my wife is ill. If anything happens to her, I'll 
ROBSON: All right, one hour. 
HARRIS: Thank you. Doctor, please, this way.

[Harrises' quarters]

(Meanwhile, Maggie has left the study when there is a ring on the doorbell. Two almost comical figures are on the doorstep.) 
OAK: (short, fat) Mrs Harris? 
MAGGIE: Yes. 
OAK: We are maintenance controllers, madam. I wonder if we might have a few words with your husband? 
MAGGIE: Oh, my husband isn't here. He's at the compound. 
OAK: Oh dear, that does make it rather difficult. We've come to carry out an inspection. 
MAGGIE: Inspection? 
OAK: In the kitchen. Your husband didn't tell you? 
MAGGIE: No. Couldn't it wait until another day? I'm not feeling very well. 
OAK: I'm sorry, madam, it has to be carried out without delay. Chief Robson's instructions. 
MAGGIE: That man never stops giving instructions, does he. Oh, I suppose you better come in then. 
OAK: Thank you. My name is Mister Oak and this is my colleague, Mister Quill. 
(Quill is tall and thin.) 
MAGGIE: Yes, well, please, be quick. I'm really not very well. 
OAK: Of course, madam. Now don't you worry about us, Mrs Harris. You won't even know that we're here. Will she? The bag, Mister Quill.

[Impeller room]

CHIEF: Mister Van Lutyens. 
VAN LUTYENS: What is it? 
CHIEF: Feed line from the Control Rig. An excessive pressure build up in the pipeline. 
VAN LUTYENS: She's almost up to capacity. 
CHIEF: She'll blow herself wide open. 
VAN LUTYENS: So there's a build up in the pressure coming in from the rigs and a drop in the pressure of the flow going out to the receiving stations. 
CHIEF: There must be something interfering with the impeller itself.

[Control hall]

PRICE: Mister Robson, sir. 
ROBSON: Yes. 
PRICE: This is from Control Rig, sir. They say there's a pressure build-up in their feed line to us. 
ROBSON: Right. Ask them how much, will you? 
PRICE: Yes, sir. 
VAN LUTYENS: Almost up to danger level, Mister Robson. Shall I give the order to turn off the gas? 
ROBSON: You will not, Mister Van Lutyens. 
VAN LUTYENS: There'll be an explosion any minute. 
ROBSON: There will not be an explosion. 
VAN LUTYENS: There must be if you don't turn off the gas. 
ROBSON: Open release valve Section D, full pressure, will you? 
VAN LUTYENS: What are you doing, man? It's too late for that. You can't possibly release enough gas in time. 
ROBSON: You want to bet, Mister Van Lutyens?

[Harrises' quarters]

(Maggie is lying down on the bed. Oak and Quill are working on the gas cooker in the kitchen. There are tendrils of seaweed sticking out from Oak's overall sleeves. He puts on a pair of white gloves, just like Quill is already wearing. They go through to the study and open the patio door. The patio is covered in foam and seaweed now, and it starts to come into the house. Maggie gets up and goes to comb her hair, then realises that Oak and Quill are in the bedroom with her.) 
MAGGIE: What are you doing in here? Is there something that you want? 
(Oak and Quill move towards her, mouths open wide. Maggie can't breathe as she inhales the toxic gas they are giving out, and collapses. Meanwhile, out on the beach, an outlet valve vents excess gas.)

[Impeller room]

CHIEF: It's down. The pressure in the pipeline, it's back to normal. 
VAN LUTYENS: Dank uw geluk. I wouldn't have thought you could possibly have done it in the time. 
ROBSON: When you have too much gas in the tube, you release it. Didn't they teach you that much back at evening classes in the Hague, Mister Van Lutyens? Contact Chief Baxter, Control Rig, will you? Tell him the immediate crisis is over. Oh, and contact the other rig chiefs. 
PRICE: Right. 
VAN LUTYENS: But the feed out to the receiving stations is still dropping. The impeller is still slowing down. 
ROBSON: What's the matter with you, Van Lutyens? You've been trying to teach me my job ever since you came here. I've been drilling for gas in the North Sea for most of my life. I don't need people like you or Harris to teach me how to do it. 
PRICE: Mister Robson, sir. It's C Rig, sir. I can't raise them. No response at all. 
VAN LUTYENS: So, the immediate crisis is over, ja?

[Harrises' quarters]

HARRIS: Maggie, I've brought the Doctor. 
VICTORIA: Oh no, it's the same 
DOCTOR: I smell gas. There's gas in this house. 
HARRIS: Doctor, in here. 
(Harris finds Maggie on the bedroom floor.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, the window, quickly! 
JAMIE: Give me a hand. 
(They break the window.) 
HARRIS: Maggie.

[Control hall]

PRICE: I'm sorry, sir, I can't raise them. 
VAN LUTYENS: Well, are you pleased with what you have done? 
ROBSON: I'm warning you, Van Lutyens. 
VAN LUTYENS: And I warned you, but you are too koppig, too stubborn to listen. Look at the facts, man. The fact that we lose contact with two rigs, have unprecedented, inexplicable pressure variations for over three weeks. 
ROBSON: Oh, so that's it. You've been talking with Harris, eh? 
VAN LUTYENS: Ja, Mister Harris did show me his figures. Only because you refused to listen to him. That's why I went out to the Control Rig, to see if there was an explanation out there. 
ROBSON: And what did you find? Nothing. I'll tell you why. Because there's nothing to find. 
VAN LUTYENS: All the same, Mister Harris' figures 
ROBSON: Are bunk! And the rest of his tuppenny ha'penny tin-pot ideas. He's still a school kid with his bits of paper and his graph and his slide rule. You think I'm going to take any notice of him? I know every nut and bolt on every one of those rigs out there. 
VAN LUTYENS: All right! So your prejudice prevents accepting Mister Harris' calculations. But what about me? Do you treat my opinion with as much contempt? 
ROBSON: You? You are here to offer me your expert advice, but I'm not obliged to take it. I run this outfit the way I think fit. Is that understood? 
CHIEF: Mister Robson, the impeller. Quick, two men.

[Impeller room]

CHIEF: She's down to a hundred and forty revs. Something must be jamming it at the base. 
(The impeller slows and stops.) 
VAN LUTYENS: Well, Mister Robson, where do we go from here? Come on, now. You have all the answers, don't you? 
CHIEF: Wait a minute. Quiet! 
VAN LUTYENS: What is it? 
CHIEF: I think I can hear something. 
(It's a heartbeat.)

[Harrises' quarters]

VICTORIA: Is she dead? 
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no. 
HARRIS: What's the matter with her? 
DOCTOR: Well, she's in some sort of coma. Possibly because of this gas. It was toxic. 
HARRIS: It isn't possible there could have been a gas leak in the flat. Besides, natural gas isn't toxic. 
DOCTOR: Well, this isn't natural gas. This is the gas we found when Victoria was locked in the Oxygen room. 
HARRIS: But where could it have come from? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. What was the matter with her before this happened? 
HARRIS: Well, she said she'd been stung by some seaweed or something. 
JAMIE: Seaweed? 
HARRIS: I asked her to get a file from my study, and she found the seaweed inside it. 
DOCTOR: Did you put it there? 
HARRIS: Well, no, of course not. 
DOCTOR: There's no marks or abrasions. 
HARRIS: No. 
VICTORIA: Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Um. 
VICTORIA: What's this? 
DOCTOR: What. Oh! 
JAMIE: A bit of seaweed. What's it doing in here? 
DOCTOR: It's still wet. 
HARRIS: Perhaps it's the same sort that Maggie was talking about. 
DOCTOR: No, don't touch it. 
HARRIS: Why? 
DOCTOR: Well in the first place, you don't want to get stung like your wife, do you? And in the second place, whoever put it in your file meant you to touch it. 
HARRIS: But that's ridiculous. Wait a minute. I was sure I put that file in my briefcase this morning, but it wasn't there when I went to get it. I was on my way home when I met Maggie. But why? Why should anyone want me to get stung by a piece of seaweed? 
VICTORIA: Well I hate the stuff. It's so slimy and horrid. 
JAMIE: Och away, you've seen seaweed before, haven't you? There was loads of it down by the pipeline this morning. 
DOCTOR: By the pipeline? 
JAMIE: Aye, the place was overrun with it. 
VICTORIA: Well not like that. It didn't move. 
JAMIE: Move?

[Impeller room]

(Van Lutyens has been studying the refinery layout in his office. He goes to the impeller room.) 
CHIEF: I want them all checked. Every remote control release valve on the line. And check and double check all those circuits. 
VAN LUTYENS: Excuse me, Chief, could I have a word with you please? 
CHIEF: Yes of course. 
VAN LUTYENS: The impeller is still not functioning, ja? 
CHIEF: No, it's not. 
VAN LUTYENS: And that sound we heard, have you heard it again? 
CHIEF: No. As Mister Robson says, it's probably just a mechanical fault. 
VAN LUTYENS: You believe that? 
CHIEF: Well it's really not my job to 
VAN LUTYENS: Ah, come on, man. You're the Chief Engineer. The impeller is your responsibility. 
CHIEF: It's not my job to formulate theories, it's Mister Robson's. 
VAN LUTYENS: Robson! Robson! What's the matter with you all? Are you frightened of him or something? 
CHIEF: No, Mister Van Lutyens, I just respect his judgement. 
VAN LUTYENS: Well, I'm sorry, Chief. Could I have a word with you in private? 
CHIEF: Well, I 
VAN LUTYENS: It's important. 
CHIEF: Check the feed valve.

[Control hall]

VAN LUTYENS: I've been looking at the installation plan, and the impeller intake valve in particular. I think I know where the blockage may be. 
CHIEF: All right. 
VAN LUTYENS: Well, this valve is at the base of the main shaft and leads directly to the intake, ja? 
CHIEF: Mmm hmm. 
VAN LUTYENS: Well, as far as I can see there is no point between that valve and the Control Rig where a blockage could occur big enough to stop the impeller. 
CHIEF: Apart from the under-sea emergency valve. 
VAN LUTYENS: But you've got remote control observation on those and they are free, ja? 
CHIEF: Mmm. 
VAN LUTYENS: So the impeller intake must be at fault. 
CHIEF: It's possible. 
VAN LUTYENS: Possible, man? It's the only answer. What we have to do is to go down and free that valve. 
CHIEF: I'll have to check with Mister Robson. 
VAN LUTYENS: Robson! Robson! What's the matter with you? Are you children? Can't you do anything on your own initiative? 
CHIEF: Look, I can't send men down there without his approval. 
VAN LUTYENS: Can you not also blow your nose without approval? 
CHIEF: Now listen to me, Mister Van Lutyens. I've worked for Mister Robson a long time. We were out there on those rigs together in the early days. You may think he's wrong to run this place in the way he does, but I trust him. And I take orders from him purely because I trust his judgement. No other reason. 
VAN LUTYENS: I'm sorry, Chief, I shouldn't have said that. You forgive me, ja? Now what I would like you to do is to go to Mister Robson and say we think we know where the blockage is, and get official permission to inspect the bass of the shaft. 
CHIEF: Just a minute, that's your theory, that's not mine. 
VAN LUTYENS: It's the only possibility. Anyway that sound you heard, it must have come from the bass of the shaft. 
CHIEF: If the main valve is open it could be an echo from any one of those rigs. 
VAN LUTYENS: If it is open! But you do not know that it is open and you will not know until you go down and check. 
CHIEF: Well, I suppose I could put it to him. 
(The heartbeat starts up again.) 
VAN LUTYENS: You're not going to tell me that that is a mechanical fault. 
CHIEF: I'll go and see him. 
VAN LUTYENS: He's in his cabin.

[Refinery corridor]

ROBSON: Chief! What's the matter? 
CHIEF: Mister Robson, that noise in the impeller, it's started again. I think we should go down and check the main valve, sir. 
ROBSON: Oh, you do, do you? 
CHIEF: Well, that's where we think the blockage is. 
ROBSON: We? 
CHIEF: Well, Mister van 
ROBSON: Mister van Lutyens. Yes, I thought he'd get his nose in. Come on.

[Impeller room]

ROBSON: You lot get back to work. Mister Van Lutyens, I want to talk to you. 
VAN LUTYENS: Mister Robson, there is something alive in the pipeline. 
ROBSON: You're out of your mind. There's nothing down there. 
CHIEF: I promise you, sir, I did hear something. 
ROBSON: You've been unnerving my crew. Now you, get out! 
VAN LUTYENS: Listen. 
ROBSON: That's it. Did you hear what I said? 
VAN LUTYENS: Now listen, will you? (heartbeats) It's down there, in the darkness, in the pipeline, waiting.

Episode Three

[Harrises' quarters]

(In the bedroom, Jamie bends down to examine the seaweed on the carpet.) 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie, don't touch it. 
JAMIE: But it's only a bit of seaweed. 
DOCTOR: Yes, unless it really did move like Victoria said. 
JAMIE: Oh, how can it move. It's not a living thing, is it? 
DOCTOR: Everything in the sea is living, Jamie. 
VICTORIA: Well, it did move. It gave me a shock. It was like a spider. 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we're not taking any chances. Hold that for me, will you? 
JAMIE: What's this for? 
DOCTOR: We're going to take a closer look at this weed. Now bring the bag down here. Right onto the floor. That's it. Now don't let it touch your fingers. Careful. Slowly does it. Mind your fingers. There. 
JAMIE: What are you going to do with it? 
DOCTOR: We're going to see if an ordinary piece of seaweed really can move. 
HARRIS: Doctor, my wife, will she be all right? 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, I think so, yes. I don't think there's any panic, but I'd get her under medical supervision if I was you. 
HARRIS: Yes, I'll go back to the Medicare centre at the compound and arrange for her to be taken in there. 
DOCTOR: Yes, you do that. 
(Harris leaves.) 
VICTORIA: Poor man. 
JAMIE: Aye. Hey! I thought we were supposed to be prisoners? 
DOCTOR: Yes, so did I. We better make the most of it. We've got a lot of work to do back at the Tardis. She seems to be sleeping peacefully. Come on. 
(The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria leave. Tendrils of seaweed start growing down Maggie's arms.)

[Impeller room]

CHIEF: What is it, that sound? 
VAN LUTYENS: It's uncanny. It's like a heartbeat. 
CHIEF: It's stopped again. 
VAN LUTYENS: Well this is surely proof enough. 
ROBSON: Proof? 
VAN LUTYENS: There is something down there blocking the impeller. 
ROBSON: Rubbish! Hysterical nonsense. 
VAN LUTYENS: But you heard it, that dreadful sound. 
ROBSON: I heard a fault in the base of the impeller. 
VAN LUTYENS: But the impeller isn't working. Don't you believe a thing until you see it? 
ROBSON: I want that pump operational in half an hour. Now get to it!

[Tardis laboratory]

(The Tardis has conveniently washed up on the beach. The Doctor gets Victoria to test a sample of the weed whilst he puts the rest in a glass tank.) 
JAMIE: What are you doing, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well you see, Jamie, these two cylinders contain a small amount of natural gas. It should be quite interesting to see what sort of effect it has on the weed. How are you doing, Victoria? 
VICTORIA: I don't know, I think you ought to have a look. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, well, that's got the natural iron content. 
VICTORIA: Well, I did the Bunsen test, like you told me, but I found something which worried me. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I'm not surprised. Is this hot? 
VICTORIA: No, no. 
DOCTOR: You see this rusty stuff here. 
VICTORIA: Yes? 
DOCTOR: Well, it means that the weed's giving out a gas. Probably toxic. 
VICTORIA: Toxic? 
(Jamie is peering into a microscope.) 
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor! What are these little wriggly things in the weed? 
DOCTOR: Now just a minute, Jamie. I'm looking at. Little wriggly things? Where? 
JAMIE: Here, look. Look in there. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, this is it! There's molecular movement! Come and see, Victoria. There. Why, that's amazing! 
JAMIE: What does it mean? 
VICTORIA: It means, Jamie, that the weed is just as much alive as you and me.

[Refinery corridor]

VAN LUTYENS: Mister Harris, I've been trying to get hold of you. Mister Robson won't listen to reason. 
HARRIS: I'm sorry, Van Lutyens, I've got something more important on my mind at the moment. 
VAN LUTYENS: Important? What is more important? 
HARRIS: My wife is ill. Get out of my way, man.

[Control hall]

HARRIS: Price! 
PRICE: Yes, sir? 
HARRIS: Is Doctor Patterson back? 
PRICE: No, we've heard nothing from D Rig, sir. 
HARRIS: Right. Get on to the Matron at the Medicare Unit and tell her to send a couple of orderlies over to my quarters with a stretcher to bring my wife in. She's ill. You know the extension. 
PRICE: Yes, sir. 
ROBSON: What's the panic now, Harris? 
HARRIS: Go on, get on with it. 
ROBSON: Harris, I asked you a question. 
HARRIS: My wife is ill. She needs medical attention. 
ROBSON: What's the matter with her, she got a hangover? 
HARRIS: She's very ill, Mister Robson. 
ROBSON: Who says so, that Doctor fellow? Incidentally, where is he and the two kids? 
HARRIS: Oh, well, I left them in my quarters when I found my wife was ill. 
ROBSON: You what? Those three prisoners were in your charge and you left them there? 
HARRIS: I was worried about my wife. I didn't have time to think about it. 
ROBSON: That's your trouble you never do think, do you, Harris, when you should. Those three prisoners were in your charge. 
HARRIS: I don't care. Don't you understand? My wife was lying on the floor when I got there. She was unconscious and that smell of toxic gas was there. She's been poisoned, Robson, poisoned! 
VAN LUTYENS: And this toxic gas, where does it come from? 
HARRIS: Oh, I don't know. 
ROBSON: And none of us will know now you've let them loose. 
HARRIS: How could they possibly have anything to do with it? 
ROBSON: That still doesn't alter the fact that you let those prisoners go without my authority. 
HARRIS: Prisoners? A harmless old man and a couple of teenagers? 
ROBSON: That harmless old man is probably a saboteur. It's probably him that's been tampering with that release valve on the shoreline. Creating all those variations in pressure you got so excited about! 
HARRIS: Oh don't be so ridiculous, Robson. You're clutching at straws, stupidly blind to the real facts! 
ROBSON: Don't shout at me, boy! 
CHIEF: Mister Robson, sir. Mister Robson. The impeller, it's moving again.

[Impeller room]

ROBSON: Good man. I told you it was only a mechanical fault, didn't I. 
CHIEF: It just started quite suddenly. 
ROBSON: Keep it going, man. 
CHIEF: I don't know if we can hold it. 
ROBSON: Don't lose it now. 
(The impeller stops again.) 
ROBSON: You fools! You stupid fools! 
CHIEF: Well, the faults not this end! It must be jammed at the base. 
ROBSON: You wanted this, didn't you? It's just what you wanted! 
VAN LUTYENS: You should have listened to me, Robson. 
ROBSON: What, turned off the flow? Ruined a reputation of thirty years? 
VAN LUTYENS: Reputation! Don't you realise that what is going on here is beyond your comprehension? That whatever it is that is in the pipelines, that's jamming the impeller, has taken over the rigs, is a menace and a threat to us all? 
ROBSON: The only menace and threat around here is you, Van Lutyens. And you Harris. Listen. What are you staring at! I want that impeller working in half an hour. I'll be in my quarters. Let me know as soon as the impeller starts moving again. 
(Robson leaves.) 
VAN LUTYENS: Dwaas. He's cracking up, Harris. 
HARRIS: Look. I've got to get back to my wife. 
VAN LUTYENS: Harris, you can't go now. He's losing control. 
HARRIS: My wife's been poisoned. 
VAN LUTYENS: She's in good hands, ja? She'll be brought into the Medicare Unit. What can you do? 
HARRIS: But I ought to go and see her. 
VAN LUTYENS: To hang about and worry, that's all. Robson is cracking up. You are the only man with authority to take over. We need you here. 
HARRIS: Chief. 
CHIEF: Sir. 
HARRIS: Mister Robson, you know him better than any of us. How do you? Do you think he's all right? 
CHIEF: Well, he's under a lot of pressure, I think he's nerves are a bit. 
VAN LUTYENS: Ja, pressure, strain. He's cracking up, I tell you. 
CHIEF: Well, you're not helping him you know. 
VAN LUTYENS: That's not my job. I am here to give technical advice which he ignores. All right, he knows a lot about engineering, but not all. And what he does not know is the state of mind of those men out there on the rigs. 
CHIEF: He ought to know. He was out on those rigs himself long enough. 
VAN LUTYENS: Oh, ja, ja. He has plenty of professional experience of normal conditions, but these are not normal conditions. There is something very strange going on here, but he refuses to accept the new factor. 
CHIEF: So what do you think he should do? 
VAN LUTYENS: I know what I would do. Close the compound, evacuate the rigs. 
CHIEF: He'd never do it. 
VAN LUTYENS: We have lost contact with two rigs. We have a major blockage in the main pipeline. The impeller is jammed, and we still don't know what is causing the trouble. 
HARRIS: But we regained contact with Baxter on Rig D and he said everything was under control. 
VAN LUTYENS: Ja, and we've not heard from him since. And what about Rig C? 
CHIEF: Oh, that could be a telecommunications fault somewhere. 
VAN LUTYENS: J., it could be, but we have to check that it is and we have to check the valve at the base of the impeller. But what does Robson do? Nothing! Nothing! 
HARRIS: Well, I suppose he might listen if we all put it to him. What do you think, Chief? 
CHIEF: You're absolutely right of course. We must check.

[Tardis laboratory]

(The Doctor shows Victoria a dusty book.) 
VICTORIA: That's it, Doctor. That's the creature I saw back at the Compound. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I was afraid it would be. 
VICTORIA: But how did it get in this book? 
DOCTOR: Well, I told you, Victoria, this is a book of legends and superstitions. This particular drawing was supplied by ancient mariners in the North Sea in the middle of the eighteenth century, Jamie. 
JAMIE: That's my time. You mean to say this is the creature that Victoria saw back at the Compound. 
DOCTOR: Yes I think there's no doubt about it. 
JAMIE: Well, what about these great clumps of weed. 
DOCTOR: Well there's obviously some connection between the weed and the creatures themselves. 
(Jamie starts to sneeze.) 
VICTORIA: Oh, no! 
DOCTOR: Gas! 
VICTORIA: What? 
DOCTOR: Jamie! Jamie, help me get the lid on! Oh, no. Quickly! 
(The seaweed has been growing in the tank and is about to slither out. Victoria screams. The weed creature falls back in and the Doctor and Jamie firmly shut the lid.) 
DOCTOR: I was right. The weed formations are feeding off the natural gas beneath the North Sea and giving off toxic gas. Come on. We must get back to Harrises' quarters. Come along. Just a minute. That weed went back in its tank very suddenly, didn't it? I wonder why? Never mind.

[Control hall]

ROBSON: No, I will not listen. It's you, Van Lutyens, isn't it? Isn't it? You've been undermining my authority ever since you came here. You and Harris. You've been stirring up trouble just to get at me, haven't you? You've even got the Chief on your side now. One of my oldest and trusted friends. 
CHIEF: Mister Robson. 
ROBSON: At least I thought I could trust you. 
CHIEF: Mister Robson, all we want to do is 
ROBSON: I know what you want! I know what you all want! You're going to get at me, just so I'll give up. I'm not going to give you that pleasure! Why don't you go and join him? Go on, join Van Lutyens! Go on, join him! What are you standing around for? What are you starring at? I'm in charge! I'm in charge here! 
(Robson leaves as Harris enters.) 
HARRIS: Mister Robson. 
ROBSON: I'm in charge of this Compound, Harris! It's my responsibility! Mine! My responsibility! 
(Robson finally leaves.) 
VAN LUTYENS: Do you still think he's capable of running this place? You do what you like. I'm going to get in touch with my people in the Hague. 
HARRIS: What can they do? 
VAN LUTYENS: I don't know. They might push your people in London into some sort of action. Give me a direct line to Van der Post, Hague Central, 
PRICE: Yes, sir.

[Robson's cabin]

(Robson slams the door then slumps down on his bunk, exhausted. Outside, Mister Oak comes down the corridor and locks Robson's door.) 
ROBSON: Who's there? Go away. I'm not to be disturbed. 
(Mister Oak operates the emergency vent controls for the cabin. Robson becomes aware of a hissing sound and the smell of gas. He sits up to see foam coming through the ventilation grille. Tendrils of weed come towards him. He shouts out.)

[Outside Robson's cabin]

HARRIS: Mister Robson? 
(Harris unlocks the door and Robson bursts out, staggering down the corridor.) 
HARRIS: Mister Robson, wait! I need your permission to send two men down the impeller shaft to 
(Robson has gone. Harris goes into the cabin and sees the tentacles coming out of the foam. He flees.)

[Harrises' quarters]

(Victoria uses a hairpin to unlock the door.) 
DOCTOR: Well, thank you, Victoria. Yes, nobody here. It's better that way. 
JAMIE: You speak for yourself. I'd rather 
VICTORIA: Oh no! 
(Jamie sneezes.) 
DOCTOR: Gas! 
VICTORIA: Where's it coming from? 
DOCTOR: Jamie, try the kitchen. 
(The Doctor and Victoria go to the bedroom and face a mass of foam coming towards them. A weed tentacle lashes out. Victoria screams and it pauses then retreats.) 
VICTORIA: What's it doing? 
(They see that the bed is empty.) 
DOCTOR: We've apparently frightened it away. 
VICTORIA: Mrs Harris? 
DOCTOR: Mrs Harris. Ah. Oh yes, of course. Mister Harris had her taken over to the Medical centre. At least I hope he did. 
JAMIE [OC]: Doctor, quick, help me! 
DOCTOR: That's Jamie! 
VICTORIA: Jamie! 
JAMIE [OC]: Doctor, I'm in here. 
(The Doctor bursts into the kitchen but there is a wall of foam in front of him. He slams the door shut again.) 
JAMIE [OC]: I can't hold out much longer. 
VICTORIA: Now what? 
DOCTOR: The terrace! 
(The Doctor and Victoria go through the study to the patio. Through the kitchen window they see Jamie standing on the kitchen table, surrounded by a rising tide of foam and tentacle.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie! Victoria, come on, follow me. 
VICTORIA: What are we going to do? 
JAMIE [OC]: Quick, Doctor. Hurry. 
(There's an external metal staircase to the roof. The Doctor and Victoria climb to the kitchen skylight and open it.) 
DOCTOR: Give me a hand! 
(They pull Jamie up and out to safety.) 
DOCTOR: Come on, out you come, Jamie. 
(The foam fills the kitchen as they scramble away, then comes out onto the roof.) 
DOCTOR: Pass him down, Victoria.

[Robson's quarters]

HARRIS: Yes, it's in here. Look. Well, it was in here. I saw it. 
VAN LUTYENS: You did? 
HARRIS: Yes, it was moving. Something alive. You don't believe me. 
VAN LUTYENS: Oh yes, I believe you, Mister Harris. It must have come out of the ventilator grille, like it did in the oxygen store. 
HARRIS: You mean when that girl Victoria was locked in. 
VAN LUTYENS: Ja. And having achieved its purpose, back down the shaft. 
HARRIS: Purpose? What purpose? 
VAN LUTYENS: Who knows? We know so little about it. And no one tries to find out. 
HARRIS: I know. 
VAN LUTYENS: Least of all Robson. 
HARRIS: Yes, he rushed out of here as though he were, he was out of his mind. 
VAN LUTYENS: You'd better alert security. He may do himself some harm. 
HARRIS: Yes, you're right.

[Outside Robson's quarters]

(Harris locks the door.) 
HARRIS: At least the stuff won't get out of here. 
VAN LUTYENS: Oh really, Mister Harris. There must be hundreds of grills in this compound. And once the foam has got into the shaft it could emerge from any one of them. 
HARRIS: I suppose you're right. Then we must insist that all emergency ventilators are kept shut. 
VAN LUTYENS: Mister Harris, you know what you must do now? 
HARRIS: Do? 
VAN LUTYENS: Assert yourself. Take over the compound.

[Control hall]

HARRIS: Price. 
PRICE: Yes, sir. 
HARRIS: I want you to alert the security posts. Mister Robson may be ill. I'd like to know his whereabouts. 
PRICE: Very good, sir. 
HARRIS: And order all areas to keep their emergency air vents closed. Understand? 
PRICE: Yes, sir. 
VAN LUTYENS: You're taking over then? 
HARRIS: Robson is still officially in charge. 
VAN LUTYENS: I've already informed my authorities at the Hague. You must do the same with your Director in London. 
HARRIS: Yes. Price? 
PRICE: Yes, sir. 
HARRIS: Get me Board Headquarters. I want to speak to Megan Jones.

[Refinery corridor]

DOCTOR: Are you all right, Jamie? 
JAMIE: Oh, I've come over dizzy. 
DOCTOR: Well, you just rest a while. 
JAMIE: I'll just get my breath back. 
VICTORIA: Doctor, why is it that we always land up in trouble? 
DOCTOR: Well, Victoria, it's the spice of life, my dear. 
VICTORIA: Oh, well I'm not so sure. I don't really like been scared out of my wits every second. 
DOCTOR: Is something wrong? 
VICTORIA: Well, I just wish that once. Oh, never mind. 
DOCTOR: Are you right, Jamie? Come on then. 
JAMIE: What's the matter with Victoria?

[Control hall]

PRICE: Thank you, Miss Jones. We'll see you then in three hours time. Goodbye. 
HARRIS: In three hours the whole compound will be crawling with board officials. 
VAN LUTYENS: Let's hope the situation doesn't get any worse. 
HARRIS: I only hope Megan Jones understands why I've taken over. It was she who insisted that Robson should know this particular complex in the early days. 
VAN LUTYENS: You did right. I will stand by you. You couldn't let Robson go on. You had the men on the rigs to think of. They are now her responsibility. 
HARRIS: If only we knew what we were up against. These creatures that have been getting into the refinery, where do they come from? We don't even know what they are? 
DOCTOR: That's where you're wrong, Mister Harris. We do know what they are. At least I think we do. Seaweed! 
HARRIS: Seaweed? 
DOCTOR: Yes. Not the sort that you'd normally find on the beach. This seaweed happens to be dangerously alive. 
HARRIS: Alive? But how can it be? 
DOCTOR: I think you better listen to me. I think you'd all better listen to me. Large formations of seaweed have been coming up on the beaches along this coast. Seaweed that shows clear indications of having life like human beings. 
CHIEF: It's this seaweed that's blocking the pipeline then. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think there's no doubt about it. 
VAN LUTYENS: We must clear the base of the impeller. 
DOCTOR: No, wait. The weed is capable of protecting itself. It gives off a toxic gas. It's also a parasite. It attaches itself to other living things. 
HARRIS: You mean human beings? But what happens to them? 
DOCTOR: I'm afraid I don't know. 
HARRIS: But my wife was stung by the seaweed. 
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, but she survived, didn't she? How is she? 
HARRIS: Well I asked the Medicare Centre to bring her in. Price? Get Medicare for me and ask how my wife is now. Doctor, I've just seen one these creature things that your young friend saw in the Oxygen room. 
DOCTOR: Oh? Where? 
HARRIS: In Mister Robson's cabin. It might have attacked him. He was in a wild state when I went in and just run out. He hasn't been seen since. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear. 
PRICE: Mister Harris, sir. 
HARRIS: Yes? 
PRICE: The Matron says she's sorry, she hasn't brought your wife in yet but she's sending someone over now. 
DOCTOR: What? 
HARRIS: What is it, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well, we've just come from your quarters. Your wife wasn't there! 
JAMIE: The place was covered with seaweed. 
HARRIS: Is this right? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I'm afraid it is. 
HARRIS: Then where is she? Where is she? I must go and find her. 
(Harris leaves.) 
VAN LUTYENS: Wait! Well, where do you think she is? Do you think it has anything to do with this seaweed stuff? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. I simply don't know.

[Beach]

(Maggie is staring out to sea. Her neck and face are covered with fronds of weed. Robson comes up and stands next to her.) 
MAGGIE: There is little time. You know what you must do? 
ROBSON: Yes. 
MAGGIE: You will obey? 
(Robson nods, then watches Maggie walk into the sea until the waves break over her head.)

Episode Four

[Control hall]

PRICE: Rig D. Rig D. Control calling Rig D. Come in, please. Rig D. Rig D. Control calling. Come in, please. I'm sorry, sir. I can't reach them. 
VAN LUTYENS: Try Rig A again. 
PRICE: Rig A. Control calling Rig A. It's no good, sir. That's three rigs not answering now, sir. 
VAN LUTYENS: The men on the remaining rigs won't last under suspense much longer. Try the guard post again. See if there's any sign of Mister Harris. 
PRICE: Very good. 
VAN LUTYENS: Three Rigs now. What can have happened to them? 
DOCTOR: Well, can't you send someone out to investigate? 
VAN LUTYENS: No, I'm afraid I have no authority here. I'm just here as technical adviser. Mister Harris is in charge. When he comes back he might possibly authorise the company helicopter for at least to take a look. 
DOCTOR: We can do nothing. 
VAN LUTYENS: Nothing. Wait. Wait.

[Impeller room]

CHIEF: Nothing. Keep checking. 
(A heartbeat sound becomes audible. The tired men become afraid.) 
CHIEF: That's started again.

[Bunk room]

VICTORIA: Jamie. Jamie? Jamie, you asleep? 
JAMIE: I'm just resting my eyes. 
VICTORIA: I don't know how you can with all this trouble going on. 
JAMIE: Oh, don't worry. The Doctor will work something out. He always does. 
VICTORIA: Yes. What then? 
JAMIE: What do you mean, what then? 
VICTORIA: Where will we be next? 
JAMIE: Oh, Victoria, you know better than to ask a question like that. We never know where we're going to land one place to the next. It's half the fun, isn't it? 
VICTORIA: Is it? 
JAMIE: Victoria, what's the matter? You've been acting very oddly ever since we got here. 
VICTORIA: Oh it's nothing. It doesn't matter. 
JAMIE: Look you'll worry the Doctor if 
VICTORIA: Jamie, I said it was nothing. Just go back to sleep. 
JAMIE: Aye. Well I wouldn't worry about that old bit of sea weed. The Doctor'll work something out. 
VICTORIA: Yes, but will he? There's so many questions. The weed grows. Feeds off natural gas. But how fast does it grow? What happens to those that touch it? Oh, Jamie. Jamie, I'm frightened! 
(The Doctor enters.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry, Victoria. Did I startle you? 
VICTORIA: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Where's Jamie? 
VICTORIA: Up there. He's still asleep. Nothing would wake him except a bomb dropping. 
DOCTOR: Oh good. 
VICTORIA: Doctor, what's happening? 
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not sure, Victoria. I'm not sure. Looks so peaceful out there, doesn't it? 
VICTORIA: I heard that noise again. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
VICTORIA: Well, what are they doing about it? 
DOCTOR: Well, we have to wait. 
VICTORIA: Wait? But what for? For one of those awful creatures to come and attack us all? 
DOCTOR: Now, Victoria, it's not as bad as all that, you know. 
VICTORIA: Isn't it? Even you don't know really how bad is it, do you? 
DOCTOR: Well, no, not exactly. 
VICTORIA: Every time we go anywhere something awful happens. Daleks. Cybermen. 
DOCTOR: Yeti? 
VICTORIA: Yes, and Yeti. Why can't we go anywhere pleasant, where there's no fighting. Just peace and happiness.

[Beach]

HARRIS: Mister Robson! Mister Robson! Robson! Robson! Mister Robson! Mister Robson! What are you doing down here, sir? Have you seen my wife at all? 
ROBSON: Your wife? 
HARRIS: I've been searching for her. 
ROBSON: You'll find her, Mister Harris. Very soon. 
HARRIS: Then you haven't seen her? 
(Robson turns and walks off along the beach.) 
HARRIS: Robson!

[Impeller room]

DOCTOR: If you don't mind my saying so, Mister Van Lutyens, I think this is a very bad idea of yours. You don't know what you're up against. 
JAMIE: Aye, you wouldn't catch me down there. 
CHIEF: Why don't we wait until Mister Harris comes back, sir? 
VAN LUTYENS: The only way to find out if this weed stuff of yours is blocking the base of the impeller is to go down and have a look. 
CHIEF: Look, Mister Van Lutyens, I have no authority to send my men down there. 
VAN LUTYENS: I realise that. That is why I am going down. 
CHIEF: By yourself? 
VAN LUTYENS: Oh yes. 
CHIEF: I wouldn't go down. Well, I hope you know what you're doing, sir. 
VAN LUTYENS: I think so. 
DOCTOR: I wish you wouldn't do this, Mister Van Lutyens. 
VAN LUTYENS: I can't sit about waiting any longer. I have no position of authority here but I do have the run of the company installations, and if I can do nothing else I can at least inspect the base of the impeller shaft. 
(Van Lutyens puts on a gas mask and steps through the airlock onto the impeller shaft lift platform.)
VAN LUTYENS: Tot straks.
DOCTOR: Good luck. 
JAMIE: Aye, you'll need it. 
CHIEF: All right, lower him down. 
(Oak and Quill are at the lift controls.)

[Impeller shaft]

(At the bottom, Van Lutyens switches on his torch and steps out of the lift. He goes to a hatch in the floor, opens it and looks down into the pipeline chamber. The heartbeat can be heard in the pipes. Suddenly Van Lutyens realises that the pipeline is full of foam and seaweed. It surges up to engulf him and he cries out as the weed grabs hold and pulls him down into the pipe.)

[Impeller room]

CHIEF: Get him up! 
VICTORIA : What is it? What's happened? 
JAMIE : Van Lutyens is down there. 
VICTORIA: What's happened to him? 
DOCTOR: Well, we don't know, Victoria. 
(The lift comes up.) 
DOCTOR: What's happened? What did you see? 
CHIEF: He's not in the shaft. He must still be down there. Let's find Mister Harris. 
DOCTOR: We can't just leave him down there. 
JAMIE: What are we going to do? 
DOCTOR: We're going down there after him. 
VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor, no. 
JAMIE: Oh no, we're not. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, you wouldn't let me go down there on my own, now would you? 
JAMIE: Er, well, no. Oh. 
VICTORIA: Oh Doctor, you can't. You don't know what's down there. 
DOCTOR: Open the airlock.

[Control hall]

PRICE: Miss Megan Jones? Just leaving the reception now. Right. Thank you. Ah, Mister Harris. Mister Harris, we've been looking for you everywhere. 
HARRIS: What is it, Price? 
PRICE: Are you all right, sir? 
HARRIS: Yes. Just tired. Is there any news of my wife? 
PRICE: No, I'm afraid not, sir. You didn't find her? Oh, Mister Harris? 
HARRIS: Yes? 
PRICE: The director, Miss Megan Jones, is leaving reception on her way here now, sir. 
HARRIS: I see. Thank you, Price. Where's Mister Van Lutyens? 
PRICE: In the Impeller area I think, sir. 
HARRIS: All right.

[Impeller room]

CHIEF: This is terrible. Do you mean to say they both went down inside that shaft? 
VICTORIA: I couldn't stop them. They went to look for Mister Van Lutyens. 
HARRIS: What? What has happened to him? 
(Oak and Quill are still at the lift controls as Harris enters.) 
CHIEF: Mister Harris, thank goodness you're back. Mister Van Lutyens went down inside the impeller shaft to try and find what was blocking the pipe line. 
HARRIS: Yes? 
CHIEF: He didn't come back. Now the Doctor and the boy has gone down there. 
HARRIS: They've done what? Get them up at once. Stop the lift. 
OAK: I'm sorry, sir. It's too late.

[Impeller shaft]

(The Doctor and Jamie are both wearing gas masks.) 
JAMIE: Gloomy sort of place, isn't it? 
DOCTOR: Jamie, that hole goes straight down to the big gasometer down below. 
JAMIE: Hey, isn't that Van Lutyens' torch? 
DOCTOR: Well, it must be. 
JAMIE: But where is he? 
DOCTOR: Shine it down there, Jamie. 
(The torch doesn't work.) 
DOCTOR: Give it to me. 
JAMIE: Come on, Doctor. Let's get out of here. You can feel there's something evil lurking down here.

[Refinery corridor]

PERKINS: It all seems quiet enough, Miss Jones. 
JONES: Of course it is. Robson's an efficient man. Why do you think I gave him control of the compound? He knows the job backwards. 
PERKINS: Then why the sudden panic? 
JONES: I don't know. Harris was rather vague. 
PERKINS: Vague? He said he was taking over from Robson. I wouldn't call that vague. 
JONES: You've never met Robson, have you Perkins? 
PERKINS: No. But I've 
JONES: When you do, you'll realise he's not the sort of man one pushes around. 
PERKINS: Then what's it all about? 
JONES: Just an internal squabble, I'd say. Harris is a bright man. I sent him thinking he might gain from Robson's practical experience. Obviously the two haven't hit it off together. 
PERKINS: So we're pouring oil. Politics? 
JONES: Let's go and see, shall we?

[Impeller room]

VICTORIA: Jamie! Doctor! Oh, I do wish they'd hurry. 
HARRIS: Is there any way we can get them up, Chief? 
CHIEF: Well, we can't use the lift in case they want to get back in a hurry. There is the ladder inside the pipe line. 
PRICE: Mister Harris? 
HARRIS: Yes, what is it, Price? 
PRICE: Miss Megan Jones has arrived, sir. 
HARRIS: Oh, I see. Thank you. Chief, you'd better come with me. I'm going to need some support when I talk to Megan Jones. 
CHIEF: All right. 
VICTORIA: But what about Jamie and the Doctor? 
HARRIS: There's isn't a great deal we can do at the moment, I'm afraid. Oak, as soon as they signal, bring them up. And if there's any sign of trouble, come and get me. 
OAK: You can rely on us. 
HARRIS: Come on, Chief. 
VICTORIA: Will they be all right. I mean, is it safe? 
OAK: Oh yes, Miss. Don't you worry about a thing. We'll take care of everything won't we, Mister Quill?

[Control hall]

JONES: Creatures? Seaweed creatures? What do you say to that, Perkins? 
PERKINS: Oh, well 
HARRIS: It's true. 
JONES: You can't be serious, Mister Harris. 
HARRIS: These creatures have been seen in the refinery itself, in the oxygen room 
JONES: By some half-witted Doctor and a couple of teenagers. 
HARRIS: And by me. 
JONES: You've seen them? 
HARRIS: Yes, Miss Jones. I have seen them. 
JONES: Harris, I understand your wife had some sort of accident. I know this must have been a considerable shock to you and I fully understand 
HARRIS: You think I'm lying, that I've been seeing things? Believe me, there are things you don't know. 
JONES: I know throughout the southern region receiving stations are working on emergency supplies. What are we going to do about it? 
HARRIS: At present there's nothing we can do about it. One by one we're losing contact with the rigs out at sea. 
JONES: Then I suggest you send someone out there to see what's going on. 
HARRIS: All right. Have I your permission to call out Air Defence. 
JONES: Certainly not. This not is a national emergency. Use the company helicopters. 
HARRIS: But you don't understand what's going on. 
JONES: Will you please do as I say. 
HARRIS: Price? 
PRICE: Yes, sir. 
HARRIS: Get me the helicopter hangar, please. 
PRICE: Very good, sir. 
JONES: Now, Mister Harris, I think I'll have a talk with Chief Robson. 
HARRIS: Oh, I'm sorry, I think. Well, he's not very well. 
JONES: Not well? In what way? 
HARRIS: Something's happened to him. That's all I can tell you. 
JONES: Well, what? What's happened? 
HARRIS: I don't know. I just don't know.

[Impeller shaft]

JAMIE: Can you see anything? 
DOCTOR: No, it's too dark, Jamie. Not a sign of Van Lutyens. 
JAMIE: Well, no point in hanging about here. 
DOCTOR: Wait a minute. 
(There's that bubbling sound.) 
DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie. Let's get out of here. Press the lift button! 
(Up in the impeller room, an alarm sounds but the room is empty.

[Control hall]

PRICE: HQ calling Rig D. This is Feed HQ calling Rig D. Come in, please. Can you hear me? 
HARRIS: It's no use, there won't be a reply. 
JONES: Don't be a fool, man. We must keep trying. If there are men out on those rigs there must be a reply. 
HARRIS: If? But we don't know. We've already lost contact with three of our drilling rigs. 
PERKINS: And you say there is definitely something down there in the impeller shaft blocking the flow? 
JONES: You've checked the impeller? 
HARRIS: Chief? 
CHIEF: It's not the impeller. I've checked every last nut and bolt. Whatever it is, it's down there in that shaft.

[Impeller shaft]

(Jamie and the Doctor are on the lift platform as the foam gets ever closer.) 
JAMIE: Get us out of here! 
DOCTOR: Take the lift up! 
(They can just see weed creatures rising up, tentacles reaching for them. Then the Doctor spots the maintenance ladder in the wall of the shaft and they head for it.)

[Impeller room]

(Oak and Quill enter from the pipeline room and lock the door, then go out into the corridor. The emergency light is still flashing and alarm sounding. Then the Doctor emerges breathless from the shaft.) 
DOCTOR: Give me your hand. 
JAMIE: You all right? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. 
JAMIE: What a climb. 
DOCTOR: It's the weed. It must fill the entire shaft. It was moving pretty quick, too. 
JAMIE: Let's get out of this in case, then. Where's Victoria? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. 
(The Doctor shuts off the alarm.) 
DOCTOR: No wonder they didn't see the lift shaft signal. There's no one here. 
JAMIE: Victoria wouldn't desert us. 
DOCTOR: No. Not unless she'd been persuaded to. Jamie, I think we'd better go and look for her. Come on. You go that way. I'll go this way. 
JAMIE: Right.

[Control hall]

JONES: Foam and weed on all the rigs? 
HARRIS: According to the helicopter pilot. And no sign of life at all. 
JONES: It's so fantastic. What on earth are we going to do? 
HARRIS: Save the lives of the men on all the other rigs. 
JONES: How? 
HARRIS: Give me permission to evacuate them. 
PERKINS: What? 
HARRIS: And then blow every one of the rigs to pieces, right out of the sea. 
PERKINS: You must be out of your mind. Miss Jones, you can't really agree to such a thing. 
HARRIS: We have to. The men's lives are more important than any of those rigs. 
PERKINS: The Minister would never agree. 
JONES: That'll do, Perkins. You ask me to destroy years of hard work, skill and government money like that? 
HARRIS: I'm asking you to destroy this evil that's in the sea before it's too late. Bomb the rigs. I implore you. 
ROBSON: No! No! Never! You leave those rigs alone. They're mine. They're mine, I tell you. Mine. 
JONES: Robson, what's the matter with you? 
ROBSON: Can't you see? They're getting at me. Those rigs, they're mine. I built them. My own flesh and blood. They're mine. They're my life! They want to destroy everything. They think in that way they can destroy me. We won't allow it. 
JONES: We? Who, Robson, who? 
ROBSON: My. I don't know. Chief. Chief. 
JONES: Are you all right, Robson? 
ROBSON: Yes, I'm all right. I don't know. I don't know if 
JONES: Robson. 
HARRIS: Let him go. The strain must have affected his mind. 
DOCTOR: Oh, it's not that, I can assure you. 
HARRIS: Doctor. 
JONES: And who are you? 
DOCTOR: Well, I 
HARRIS: Doctor, I've almost forgotten. What about Van Lutyens? Did you? 
DOCTOR: I'm afraid not. 
HARRIS: Have you any idea what happened? 
DOCTOR: Yes. Jamie and I nearly joined him. The whole of the bottom of the impeller shaft is covered in weed and foam. 
JONES: What happened to Mister Van Lutyens? And Mister Robson? 
DOCTOR: I'm afraid that Mister Robson is being controlled by some force that emanates from this weed. 
JONES: That's incredible. 
HARRIS: That's what we've said so far about everything the Doctor has told us. Each time he's been proved right. I think it's about time we started to believe him. 
JONES: All right. The least I can do is listen.

[Refinery corridor]

JAMIE: Victoria. Victoria, it's me, Jamie. Where are you? Victoria!

[Control hall]

JONES: You think this seaweed or what ever it is, is a living organism capable of exercising telepathic control? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
JONES: But seaweed's a vegetable matter. Everyone knows that. 
DOCTOR: This is a struggle for power, Miss Jones. Matter over mind. I'm convinced all these people Mrs Harris, Chief Robson, Mister Van Lutyens, have all been overcome in this struggle and goodness knows how many more people. 
HARRIS: But where does the weed get this intelligence from, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: From the human brain. It's parasitic. 
HARRIS: You mean the creatures have taken over human beings? 
DOCTOR: I don't know, but they've certainly become part of the colony. 
PRICE: Mister Harris? Control rig. 
BAXTER [on monitor]: Hurry. Hurry. Emergency. 
HARRIS: Control. Yes, Baxter, what is it? 
BAXTER [on monitor]: At last. Mister Harris, for pity's sake, they're all around us. 
HARRIS: What is, Chief? What's happening? 
BAXTER [on monitor]: These things, they're everywhere. They're all over every thing, in every place. Mister Harris 
HARRIS: Baxter! Baxter! Can you hear us? 
BAXTER [on monitor]: Argh! Get us out of here! Somebody get us out of here! 
(The screen goes blank.) 
PRICE: Feed HQ calling Control rig. Come in please. Come in please.

[Impeller room]

JAMIE: Victoria? Victoria? Victoria? Back to square one. She must be somewhere. 
(Jamie looks through the window into the pipeline room. He sees Victoria lying on the steps by the gas pipe.) 
JAMIE: Victoria! 
(The door is locked. Jamie finds a key lying around and tries it.)

[Pipeline room]

JAMIE: Victoria. Victoria. Say something. No. No, you can't be dead. Victoria, if anything happened to you, I'd never forgive myself. 
VICTORIA: Oh Jamie, I didn't know you cared. 
JAMIE: Victoria Waterfield! You tricked me! That's not fair. 
VICTORIA: I did not. I was unconscious. 
JAMIE: Aye? What happened? 
VICTORIA: Those two engineers, they must have 
JAMIE: What engineers? 
VICTORIA: You know, the, the, and the little one. 
JAMIE: You mean the two that were with the swing 
VICTORIA: Yes. Yes, that's right. Oh, I don't remember. I must have passed out. 
JAMIE: If I ever get my hands on them. You know the Doctor and me, we were nearly. Aye, well, never mind about that. 
VICTORIA: Oh Jamie, why are we always getting into trouble like this? It's the same everywhere we go. 
JAMIE: How do you mean? 
VICTORIA: I don't know. I'm just fed up. I'm tired of one crisis on top of another. I just want some piece and quiet. 
JAMIE: But, Victoria, are you not happy with the Doctor and myself? 
VICTORIA: Oh yes, yes, I am. But I just. 
JAMIE: What's the matter? 
VICTORIA: Listen. 
JAMIE: Hey, what's the matter? 
VICTORIA: Listen, Jamie. 
JAMIE: What is it? 
VICTORIA: Can't you hear it? It's that noise again. 
JAMIE: Yes but where's it coming from? Victoria, look! 
(The transparent panel in the pipe is full of foam.)

[Control hall]

DOCTOR: With the Control rig gone, we can draw only once conclusion. The weed is trying to take over all the rigs and form one vast colony. 
JONES: With what objective? 
DOCTOR: The saturation of the British Islands and perhaps in time the entire planet. 
PERKINS: Is such a thing possible? 
DOCTOR: Oh yes. Unless we can find the nerve centre and destroy it. 
JONES: But how can we possibly do that? It could be anywhere out there in the North Sea. 
DOCTOR: Yes, that is the difficulty. 
JAMIE: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: What is it? 
JAMIE: Doctor, the pipeline. Quick. 
VICTORIA: Quickly, come and see. 
DOCTOR: All right. What's happened? 
JAMIE: It's here. It's come up.

[Pipeline room]

JONES: What in heaven's name is that? 
DOCTOR: The advance guard. 
JONES: I don't understand. What's happening? 
DOCTOR: The first part of the invasion. 
VICTORIA: Doctor, don't go near. 
DOCTOR: It's begun. The battle of the giants.

Episode Five

[Control hall]

PRICE: Feed HQ calling Rig F. Feed HQ calling Rig F, can you hear me? Come in, please. Oh, Mister Harris? Mister Harris, I can't raise any of the rigs. Not one. 
HARRIS: This is unbelievable! 
PRICE: I'll try again, sir. Feed HQ calling Rig B. Feed HQ calling Rig B, can you hear me? 
JONES: Well, keep trying, man. 
DOCTOR: Your wasting your time, Miss Jones. By now all those rigs will have been taken over by the weed colony. 
HARRIS: I don't care about the rigs. What's happened to the crews? 
DOCTOR: The worst, I'm afraid. 
HARRIS: Then we've got to destroy the rigs. 
JONES: No! 
DOCTOR: No, we daren't do that . 
HARRIS: Why not? 
DOCTOR: Well, that would spread this menace over a wide area and make it impossible to attack it. 
HARRIS: Well, what are we going to do? 
DOCTOR: No, what is the weed going to do? 
JONES: What can it do? 
DOCTOR: Well, let's think. Now I imagine that in the first place the weed was drawn up by one of the drilling rigs. 
HARRIS: No, no. Anything that comes up through the bores would be cleared by the engineers at the source otherwise it would block the pumps. 
DOCTOR: Precisely. And the engineers who cleared it must have touched it, yes? 
HARRIS: Yes, so they must have been amongst the first to be controlled. 
DOCTOR: And since then, this attack, and it is an attack, has followed a set pattern. 
JONES: How do you mean? 
DOCTOR: Top priority people have been attacked first. 
JONES: If your theory is correct, the weed now controls two people who know the entire layout and structure of this whole compound. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm very much afraid that is true. 
JONES: Robson was here not long ago. We must find him and prevent them using him, for his own sake as well as ours. 
HARRIS: Yes I agree. Price? 
PRICE: Sir. 
HARRIS: Get security to search the entire compound. I want Mister Robson found and put under armed guard in his cabin. 
PRICE: Very good, sir. 
HARRIS: Doctor, there's one thing that doesn't fit in with your theory. 
DOCTOR: Oh, and what's that? 
HARRIS: When Victoria was locked in the Oxygen room. Now she's nothing to do with the personnel here. 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's something that's been puzzling me too. But she disturbed somebody who was interfering with the oxygen supplies. 
HARRIS: Someone wearing a gas mask. 
DOCTOR: Now supposing that person was under the control of the weed, he was wearing a gas mask for one reason only. 
HARRIS: Because to him pure oxygen would be toxic? 
DOCTOR: Exactly, Mister Harris. 
HARRIS: Well then, we can use the oxygen as a weapon against the weed. 
DOCTOR: Well, it's only a theory at the moment. 
JONES: Well as Mister Harris said before, you've been right so far. There's no reason why you shouldn't be now. 
(Oak and Quill leave.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, how nice to be trusted. But I only hope I am right.

[Oxygen room]

(Outside the Oxygen store room, Oak and Quill put on gas masks, then enter.)

[Control hall]

PRICE: Good. See that he stays there. Mister Harris? 
HARRIS: Yes? 
PRICE: They've found Mister Robson. 
HARRIS: Good. Where? 
PRICE: In his cabin, lying on his bunk, apparently. 
HARRIS: Oh well that's a relief. 
PRICE: There's a guard at the door, sir. 
HARRIS: Good. 
JONES: Mister Harris. I want to see Mister Robson. 
HARRIS: Robson? But he's ill. He won't be able to put two 
JONES: I want to see him. 
HARRIS: But you've seen him already. Surely you could see he was in no fit state to help us in any way. 
JONES: I fully realise that, Mister Harris, but we're old friends. He might talk to me. There's just a possibility that he may know something that could help us. 
HARRIS: I see. All right, but I'm coming with you. Robson's in an unpredictable state at the moment. He could be violent. 
JONES: All right. You come too, Perkins. 
PERKINS: Yes, Miss Jones. 
(Jones and Perkins leave.) 
HARRIS: Oh, if anything happens, Price, anything at all, I'll be with Miss Jones in Mister Robson's cabin. 
PRICE: Very good, sir. 
HARRIS: Chief. 
CHIEF: Right, sir.

[Corridor]

PERKINS: Look, why don't you get the Minister to call up the National Defences? 
JONES: What exactly do you suppose the armed forces could do? 
PERKINS: Well, attack this weed or whatever it is. 
JONES: How? If we attack the rigs what about the men out there? 
PERKINS: But we don't know that they are there. 
JONES: Equally we don't know that they aren't. They could be prisoners, anything. And anyway, even if we blow the rigs out of the sea there's no guarantee it will end this nightmare. It might well spread the menace as the Doctor suggested. 
HARRIS: This way please, Miss Jones. 
JONES: Right. And come along, Perkins. Don't look so worried, man. You might as well go home. Oh, I'm sorry. Come on.

[Outside Robson's cabin]

JONES: If you please, Harris. 
HARRIS: Miss Jones, I'd rather you let me or Perkins come in with you. 
JONES: No. Now don't fuss, Harris. I'll be perfectly all right.

[Robson's cabin]

(Robson is lying on his bunk, staring at the ceiling.) 
JONES: Robson. Robson! John. John? It's all right. John, it's me Megan, Megan Jones. 
ROBSON: Megan. 
JONES: I want to try to help you. 
ROBSON: Can't help. No one can help. 
JONES: John, can you tell us what happened? 
ROBSON: No. 
JONES: John, listen to me. We can't help you unless you help us. 
ROBSON: Can't help. No one can help. 
JONES: Yes, we can, John, if you let us. Now whatever it is that's affecting you, you've got to fight it. 
ROBSON: Can't fight. 
JONES: You've got to fight it, John. 
ROBSON: Can't fight it. 
JONES: Now come on, Robson. Robson! Now listen to me. I'm director of the board. I put you in charge of this area and I can just as easily send you back to the rigs. Do you understand me, Robson? Now pull yourself together, man! 
ROBSON: Megan, I 
JONES: Pull yourself together! 
ROBSON: Megan. Megan, help me. Help. Help me, Megan! 
JONES: John. 
ROBSON: Help! 
JONES: It's all right, John. 
(Harris and Perkins enter.) 
HARRIS: Miss Jones? 
JONES: John, can you hear me? Can you hear me? It's as if he was in a trance. Hypnotised. I thought for a minute he was rational. 
HARRIS: I think we'd better let him rest.

[Outside Robson's cabin]

JONES: Harris, is there nothing we can do to help him? 
HARRIS: No, the Doctor couldn't help my wife so I'm sure there is nothing he can 
JONES: No. No, of course not. As far as I can see the only thing to do is to destroy this weed. Come on.

[Control hall]

(The Doctor is thinking.)
JAMIE: He does look worried this time. It's beginning to give me the willies. 
VICTORIA: Yes. I wish we could go back to the Tardis, leave all this trouble behind. 
JAMIE: We couldn't do that. You know the Doctor would never leave these people. Not while there's 
VICTORIA: I know, I know. 
JAMIE: Oh, Victoria, you're not going to start again, are you? Look, the Doctor's got enough trouble as it is. Let him just sit and work it out. Anyway, he says there's an obvious answer to this seaweed stuff. 
VICTORIA: An answer? What do you mean? 
JAMIE: A way of fighting it. 
VICTORIA: If it's that obvious he'd have thought of it by now. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
(Jones, Harris and Perkins enter.) 
JONES: Well Doctor, have you thought of a way in which we can attack this weed? Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Oh, Miss Jones. No, I'm afraid I haven't. 
JONES: Well, have you any idea what it might do next? 
DOCTOR: Well, I think it has little alternative but to attack us here. 
HARRIS: Here? 
PERKINS: But why? 
DOCTOR: Because this is the gas distribution centre. It'll want to gain control of it. We must find a way of attacking it's nerve centre before it does. 
PERKINS: But where is the nerve centre? 
DOCTOR: That's the trouble. We don't know. 
HARRIS: And we're not sure yet quite how to destroy it, are we? 
DOCTOR: No, but there is something at the back of my mind. 
PERKINS: Well what about the oxygen? 
DOCTOR: Yes, that is a possibility. 
JONES: Then we must put the oxygen supply room under guard. 
HARRIS: Right!

[Robson's cabin]

(Robson is asleep when the heartbeat starts up. His eyes open and he looks at the ventilation grille in the wall. Robson gets up and goes to the door.) 
ROBSON: Yes. Yes. Yes.

[Outside Robson's cabin]

(Robson attacks the guard from behind with his weed-covered hands. He breathes toxic gas onto his face, knocking him out.)

[Control hall]

(Blake reports the sabotage of the oxygen supply room.) 
HARRIS: The whole of the oxygen store? 
BLAKE: Yes, sir. There are no reserves left at all. 
HARRIS: They seem to be one step ahead of us all the time. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I was right. Someone amongst us here is under the control of the weed. 
HARRIS: You mean apart from Robson and Van Lutyens? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid so. 
HARRIS: How will we find out who they are? 
DOCTOR: I don't know, that's the difficulty. 
HARRIS: Well, we must do a personnel check. Now there's a fingerprint file in security. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
HARRIS: Doctor, I shall need your help. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
(Jamie spots Oak and Quill about to leave.) 
JAMIE: Hey, you two. Just a moment. Stop!

[Corridor]

JAMIE: Come back. You wont get away from me! 
(Jamie tackles Quill.) 
VICTORIA: Careful! 
(The Doctor and Harris are at the end of the corridor as Oak gets away. Quill gets out of Jamie's grasp and breathes on him. Jamie staggers, then punches Quill before he can get out of reach. Victoria screams. Quill drops to the floor.) 
JAMIE: That soon put paid to him, didn't it. Didn't know what hit him, did he. 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, I'm sure you're right. 
JAMIE: There's a wee bit of power left in the old McCrimmon punch yet. 
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to disillusion you, Jamie, but I don't think it was the punch that did it. 
CHIEF: Mister Harris! 
HARRIS: What is it? 
CHIEF: I think you better come, sir. Quickly!

[Control hall]

(There is a mass of weed and foam on the monitor.) 
JONES: What's the trouble? 
HARRIS: The pipeline room. 
JONES: But it's incredible. 
PERKINS: Why can't we do something? 
JONES: We'll have to trust this strange Doctor. He's the only one who seems to be able to anticipate events. 
PERKINS: Don't you think that in itself is suspect? 
JONES: He's our only hope. Come on.

[Pipeline room]

(Jamie points to the transparent panel in the pipeline.) 
JAMIE: What's happened to it, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: It's beginning to expand, like it did in the Tardis. 
JAMIE: Is there no way of stopping it? 
DOCTOR: No. I should have thought of this. 
JONES: What, do you mean this horrible stuff's growing all the time? 
DOCTOR: I'm very much afraid so! 
PRICE [OC]: Mister Harris, sir. Mister Harris. Mister Robson's broken out of his cabin. He's attacked the guard! 
JAMIE: Doctor, look at that! 
(The panel in the pipe starts to crack, then foam burst into the room. A weed tentacle grabs an engineer, pulling him into the foam.) 
DOCTOR: Right, Jamie, right back. Back, everyone back. Come along.

[Impeller room]

DOCTOR: Miss Jones, I think it's time you went. Come along. 
TANNOY: Emergency alert. 
JAMIE: Where's Victoria? 
DOCTOR: Well, she was here. 
JAMIE: Victoria? 
DOCTOR: She was here, standing along side you. 
JAMIE: I thought she was with you! 
DOCTOR: No! 
JAMIE: Where's she gone? 
DOCTOR: She must have gone through there. 
(But the safety doors between the impeller room and control hall close, locking them in.) 
JAMIE: Hey! 
DOCTOR: The doors! 
JAMIE: They won't open. 
DOCTOR: Open these doors! Open these doors! Try here, Jamie! 
JAMIE: They're closed, too. 
(The Doctor goes to the door to the corridor and holds it open with his body.) 
DOCTOR: They're not, come along! 
(Jamie is still looking for Victoria.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, the doors, they're heavy. I can't hold them! Jamie, hurry! Jamie! Jamie, come on! This way, in here. Hurry up, I can't hold them! 
(Jamie goes over as the gas fills the room and they both get into the corridor just in time.)

[Corridor]

JAMIE: Now what do we do? 
DOCTOR: We must look for Victoria. You go that way, I'll go this. 
JAMIE: Right. 
(At the seaward entrance to the refinery building, Robson is carrying the unconscious Victoria. He puts her in the passenger seat of a Mini Moke then drives away. Klaxons wail across the area.)

[Control hall]

HARRIS: Seal off the pipeline room completely. Close the pipelines in and out. Well, come on, man, don't just stand there! Guards! You must find Mister Robson. Search everywhere. 
(The Moke hurtles along the cliff top road to the airstrip. Robson drags Victoria out and carries her to a waiting helicopter, then starts it up and takes off.)

[Control hall]

PRICE: Mister Harris! 
HARRIS: What is it? 
PRICE: Mister Robson has just taken off. 
(The helicopter heads out to sea.) 
JAMIE: Hey, have you seen Victoria? 
HARRIS: No, I haven't. 
JAMIE: Doctor, have you found her yet? 
DOCTOR: No, I was hoping you had. 
JAMIE: But she was standing right beside us. 
DOCTOR: No, no, no. 
HARRIS: Doctor, it's Robson. He's trying to get away in one of the company helicopters. 
JAMIE: What? 
HARRIS: I'm afraid he's got your young girl with him. 
DOCTOR: Oh no. Oh no. Can I speak to him from here? 
HARRIS: Yes. Price, switch to RT. 
PRICE: Yes, sir. 
DOCTOR: This one? 
PRICE: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Robson. Robson. Robson, listen to me. Can you hear me?

[Robson's helicopter]

DOCTOR [OC]: Robson. Come back, man. Come back. Robson, don't you realise what they're trying to do to you? They're trying to control you. 
ROBSON: Now listen to me. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Robson. Robson. 
ROBSON: Listen! Listen!

[Control hall]

ROBSON [OC]: I have the girl. She is my prisoner. She is my hostage. Do you understand? If you want her to live, come over to us. Come over to us. 
DOCTOR: Robson. Robson! 
PRICE: He's switched off, sir. 
JONES: What did he mean, come over to us? 
DOCTOR: Well, he meant exactly what he said! 
HARRIS: You mean they want you? 
DOCTOR: Yes, they must think I'm a serious menace. 
HARRIS: But you won't go, surely? 
DOCTOR: But of course. 
JONES: But we need you here. You're our only hope. 
JAMIE: Doctor, we can't let him take Victoria! Now we've got to do something to stop him! 
JONES: You can't go with that man. You can see he's not responsible. 
DOCTOR: Jamie's right. We've got to go after him. 
HARRIS: Yes, you can use a company helicopter. 
JONES: Harris! If we let this man go now what hope have we got? 
DOCTOR: Miss Jones, I have a feeling that Mister Robson is going to lead us to the nerve centre of the colony. 
HARRIS: Price, tell the helicopter crew to stand by. Doctor, come with me. I'll get you some transport. Quickly.

[Harris' office]

HARRIS: Good. Thank you, Price. Tell them not to lose touch. Oh and Price? The Doctor and the boy, are they airborne yet? 
PRICE [OC]: No, sir. They're just approaching the airfield. 
(Another helicopter is ready to take off as the Doctor and Jamie run over to it. Once aboard, the pilot takes off and they go after Robson. Robson is on final approach to rig.)

[Harris' office]

PRICE [OC]: Mister Harris, sir. Mister Harris, the Doctor's airborne. 
HARRIS: Good.

[Control hall]

HARRIS: Doctor, can you see Robson? 
DOCTOR [OC]: No, we can't see anything here. 
HARRIS: All right, listen carefully. We managed to track him on the radar scope. He's just landed on the control rig complex. 
DOCTOR [OC]: The control rig complex. 
HARRIS: What? Say again. 
DOCTOR [OC]: We are proceeding there now. 
JONES: What chance have they got? 
HARRIS: Your guess is as good as mine. 
JONES: What do we do now? 
HARRIS: We sit and wait. 
JONES: But we can't 
HARRIS: If the Doctor hasn't done something within an hour, I'm evacuating the compound. 
JONES: No, it's 
HARRIS: And that's final, Miss Jones.

[Doctor's helicopter]

DOCTOR: Jamie, there's the control rig complex. 
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor. One of those towers is all covered in white. 
DOCTOR: Yes, it's foam. That's the nerve centre. 
(They circle, looking for a landing site.) 
JAMIE: Robson's helicopter. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
JAMIE: We can't land there. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes we can, Jamie. 
(Their pilot descends to hover over the pad, sending foam flying. They deploy a rope ladder and the Doctor comes down.)

[Control Rig]

DOCTOR: Come on in. The water's lovely. 
(Jamie climbs down, the weights in the hem of his kilt preserving his modesty from the turbulence of the rotors.) 
DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie. 
(Jamie reaches the pad, the Doctor gives the pilot the thumbs-up and he flies away.) 
DOCTOR: Goodbye. Now, down the hatch.

[Rig corridor]

(The Doctor and Jamie go down a ladder into a long metal corridor.) 
DOCTOR: So far so good, Jamie. 
JAMIE: But the driver, will he wait for us? 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, he said he'd hang around. 
JAMIE: Where do we go from here? 
DOCTOR: I think we'll go along down here. 
JAMIE: It's like walking into the lion's den. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, we're already in the lion's den. What we've got to concentrate on is keeping our heads out of his mouth. Now come on.
(They walk along to another metal staircase going deeper down into the rig.) 
JAMIE: It's very quiet. Do you think Victoria really is down here? 
DOCTOR: There's nowhere else she can be. 
JAMIE: I suppose you're right. Vic 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie. Jamie! Now there's no element of surprise! 
VICTORIA [OC]: Jamie! Doctor! 
JAMIE: See, I was right. 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie! 
JAMIE: What's the matter? 
DOCTOR: If you were hunting what would you do? 
JAMIE: Well I would set. Oh I see. You think it might be a trap. 
DOCTOR: Might be. Let's be cautious just in case, hey? 
(The sound of the heartbeat gets louder as they check each room they come to. The third door is at the end of this corridor.) 
DOCTOR: Here we go.

[Rig cabin]

(The Doctor throws open the door and reaches for the light switch. The foam in the room is waist deep with someone standing in the middle of it, weed on his body.) 
JAMIE: It's Robson! 
ROBSON: Come in, Doctor. We've been waiting for you.

Episode Six

[Rig cabin]

DOCTOR: What do you want with me? 
ROBSON: You are going to help our new masters. They need you. 
DOCTOR: They need me? 
VICTORIA [OC]: Jamie! Doctor! 
ROBSON: You are going to help 
JAMIE: Victoria. 
(Jamie leaves.) 
ROBSON: With the conquest of the human planet. 
VICTORIA [OC]: Jamie! 
JAMIE [OC]: Where are you? 
VICTORIA [OC]: In here. 
DOCTOR: Don't you realise what they've done to you? They're trying to control your mind, man! 
VICTORIA [OC]: Oh, hurry. 
JAMIE [OC]: It's locked. 
VICTORIA [OC]: Hurry. 
ROBSON: The mind does not exist. It is tired. It is dead. It is obsolete. Only our new masters can offer us life. 
DOCTOR: Matter will never conquer mind. It's against the law of nature! 
ROBSON: The body does not exist. Soon we shall all be one. 
(Robson steps forward and breathes toxic gas onto the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, hurry!

[Rig corridor]

DOCTOR: Hurry, Jamie. 
ROBSON: You cannot escape. You must join us. You must join us. You will join us. (Jamie frees Victoria from a room at the end of the corridor. She screams.) 
DOCTOR: Scream again, Victoria! 
(She does. Robson stops and clutches his head in pain.) 
ROBSON: No! No! No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! 
(Robson goes back into the cabin and sinks down into the foam.) 
DOCTOR: Come along. It's time we got out of here. 
VICTORIA: What about the door? 
JAMIE: Yes, should we lock him in? 
DOCTOR: No, no. I think it's all right now. The helicopter's waiting. Come along. Mind the stairs, they're slippery.

[Control rig]

(The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria come out of the hatch and go to the heli-pad.) 
DOCTOR: Well, where's the helicopter then? 
VICTORIA: I can't see anything except this awful foam. 
JAMIE: Don't worry, Victoria, it won't hurt you. 
DOCTOR: There it is! 
ALL: Hey! Hey! Hey! 
VICTORIA: Oh, can't he see us? 
DOCTOR: Probably not. 
JAMIE: He's probably just too scared. 
DOCTOR: Oh Jamie, help me get this hatchway covered. We can't hang around here. The helicopter will never see us. 
JAMIE: But we'll never get of the rig without it. 
DOCTOR: There's Robson's helicopter in there. 
JAMIE: But it hasn't got a driver. 
DOCTOR: I've been dying to get my hands on one of those things. Come on. Come on.

[Helicopter]

(The Doctor starts up the engine and it begins to take off as the foam tries to smother the machine.) 
VICTORIA: Oh the foam, Doctor! I can't see! 
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Victoria. We'll soon be out of it. 
JAMIE: I hope you know what you're doing. 
DOCTOR: Well, we're airborne, aren't we, Jamie? Anyway, Astrid Ferrier. We watched her fly one of these things. 
VICTORIA: That's the only time. 
DOCTOR: Now, don't worry, Victoria. It's a very primitive machine, you know. It should be easy to control. 
VICTORIA: Doctor, look out! 
(But flying in three dimensions is not that easy, and the helicopter weaves around, making near-misses of the rig. Oh's and gasps of fear from Victoria and Jamie.) 
DOCTOR: Well, that's strange. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: Well, I was always under the impression that you couldn't loop the loop in a helicopter. 
JAMIE: What? 
VICTORIA: Look out! 
(They suddenly loose height, heading back to the rig. The Doctor narrowly avoids a crash.) 
PILOT [OC]: Stick back. Stick back. Nose down a bit. Go on. Right pedal down. Right rudder. 
(It's the pilot of the other helicopter to the rescue.) 
DOCTOR: Right rudder. 
PILOT [OC]: Not too much, not too much. Try and keep the nose on the horizon. That's better. Okay. Okay. Now too much. Stick back! Stick back! Stick back, you want to come up now. Come on, you're getting too near the water. Much too near the water. Stick back. Stick back. That's better. Pull her up! Stick back! Stick back quickly! To the right. You're about to hit the water. That's right. Now try and keep everything centralised. Okay, now pull her up. Stick back! Stick back! Quickly, stick back, stick back! Now try and keep the control central. 
(The Doctor finally gets his helicopter under a semblance of control.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you so much. Oh, just one thing. I've got it up all right and it should be comparatively simple to propel it forward. However, how do I land it?

[Control hall]

HARRIS: It's no good. We won't hear from the Doctor or any of them. We must evacuate the compound. 
JONES: No! We said an hour. He's got ten more minutes. 
HARRIS: But even if he does come back, what good could he do? The only possible weapon we might have used against the weed has been destroyed. 
JONES: That was your entire stock of oxygen, was it? 
HARRIS: Yes. 
JONES: Right. Perkins, get onto London to the Defence Minister. I want a full red alert on this now. Tell him what's happened and ask him to arrange for as many tankers of oxygen as he can muster to be sent here immediately. 
PERKINS: Yes, Miss Jones. 
HARRIS: They won't be in time. We must evacuate the compound. The pipeline room is a mass of weed and foam. You've seen how rapidly it reproduces. It could swamp the entire compound at any moment. 
JONES: It could, but it hasn't yet, and until it does, we stay here. 
HARRIS: And when it does attack, how do you expect to fight it? With what weapons? 
DOCTOR: Perhaps I can answer those questions, Mister Harris. 
JONES: Doctor! Oh, thank heavens you're alive. 
HARRIS: What about Robson? Did you find him? 
JAMIE: Aye, we found him all right. 
HARRIS: And my wife? 
DOCTOR: Well, we didn't see her, no. 
HARRIS: No. There's not much hope, is there. What can we do? How can we fight this hideous thing? 
DOCTOR: You say there's not much hope. I believe there is. 
HARRIS: But even if we succeed in fighting of the weed, what about those people already affected by it? 
DOCTOR: Well on our way back here we stopped of at the Medicare Centre. The man that Jamie fought with in the corridor has almost completely recovered. 
HARRIS: What? 
DOCTOR: Yes, the weed growth on his arm has disappeared and died. He's bemused, he's dazed, but he's alive! 
HARRIS: But how? Why? What killed the weed? 
DOCTOR: Noise! Sound vibrations. 
JONES: How did you find out? 
DOCTOR: Victoria discovered it. 
VICTORIA: I did? 
DOCTOR: Well, yes. You screamed. 
VICTORIA: I screamed. 
DOCTOR: It's her scream, her particular pattern of sound that does the trick. 
HARRIS: So that's why the crews on the rigs spoke softly. The noise affected them. 
DOCTOR: Yes, very possibly. Now, before you evacuate this compound, just give me one half hour. 
HARRIS: The risk is too great. The entire compound is alive with seaweed. 
JONES: Half an hour won't make that much difference. Doctor, what do you think we can do? 
DOCTOR: We make a noise, Miss Jones. We make an awful lot of noise! 
HARRIS: It's too late. We'll never stop it now. 
DOCTOR: But we've got to. It may be too late. 
HARRIS: It's impossible, I tell you. It's seeping in from every corner of the compound. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but if we can destroy the weed's nerve centre. 
JONES: But you said yourself you don't know where the nerve centre is. 
DOCTOR: But we do. It's here. 
HARRIS: That's the Control Rig. 
DOCTOR: Precisely. We must generate enough sound to penetrate the Control Rig. 
JONES: But how will you get it there? 
DOCTOR: That way. Through the pipelines. Mister Harris, this is the only way to help your wife and all those other people. 
HARRIS: Yes, I realise that, but there isn't time. 
DOCTOR: Please. Just one half hour. 
HARRIS: Price. 
PRICE: Sir. 
HARRIS: What's happening in the pipeline room? 
(A monitor is switched on.) 
VICTORIA: Oh, no. 
PRICE: Half an hour? 
HARRIS: Yes, that's about all we've got. But you're right. We must try. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Now then, Mister Price, where do all these big leads go to? 
PRICE: The transmitter and loud speakers down below, sir. 
DOCTOR: I see. 
PRICE: What's this all about, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well, if we can boost this equipment to transmit enough sound down the pipeline, we can destroy the weed's nerve centre. 
JONES: But do you think this idea will work? 
DOCTOR: Have you got a tape recorder or some such thing? 
PRICE: Yes, sir. 
DOCTOR: Victoria, I want you to scream. 
VICTORIA: Scream? 
DOCTOR: He will record it. Make a loop of it so that we can repeat it endlessly. 
PRICE: Right, sir. What have we got here? 
JONES: I hope he knows what he's doing. 
JAMIE: Of course he does. I think. 
CHIEF: Mister Harris, the impeller shaft. You men, quick! 
JONES: Oh come on, Doctor.

[Impeller room]

CHIEF: Look, there! 
(The weed and foam smashes through the doors and into the airlock.)

[Control hall]

DOCTOR: Take these magnetised speakers and attach them to the pipeline over there. Jamie, give me a hand. 
PRICE: Right, ready miss? Now scream into this. Now. 
VICTORIA: What, now? 
PRICE: Yes, yes. There's not a moment to lose. 
VICTORIA: I can't. It's silly. 
PRICE: No, no. Please, please, you have to. 
VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor! 
DOCTOR: What's the matter, Victoria? 
PRICE: She can't scream, sir. 
DOCTOR: Oh no! Oh Victoria, that's ridiculous. 
VICTORIA: Jamie, you can't scream just like that! 
DOCTOR: Everything depends upon you screaming. 
(Victoria screams.) 
DOCTOR: There you are. I knew you could. 
(Victoria screams again as she looks over the Doctor's shoulder to see the foam burst out of the impeller room airlock and start to flood the room.) 
HARRIS: Run! Don't just stand there! 
DOCTOR: Keep away from it! Keep away! 
CHIEF: Shut those doors! 
HARRIS: Quick, this way.
(The Chief and Harris come back into the control hall and jam the impeller room door closed. The trapped technicians fall victim to the foam and weed.) 
HARRIS: All release valves open! Quick! 
JONES: What are you doing, man? 
HARRIS: I'm going to save the lives of an awful lot of people, Miss Jones. Close feed lines one to six! Come on, man! 
JONES: You mean you're giving up? You're evacuating? 
HARRIS: Open your eyes, Miss Jones. Can't you see what's happening? We're gradually being strangled. I can't risk the lives of these men here any longer. 
DOCTOR: Just a few more minutes, please, Mister Harris. The scream's ready. 
HARRIS: Good! 
DOCTOR: And Mister Harris. 
HARRIS: All right, all right, what do you want us to do? 
DOCTOR: Now then, I've attached the speakers to the pipeline. Victoria's scream will be put through this. 
HARRIS: What does that do? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's a little toy of my own. Together with the amplifiers, yes, it should produce a sonic laser sound wave. 
JONES: You mean like a laser light beam? 
DOCTOR: Yes, passing through the pipes. It'll destroy the nerve centre of the weed. 
HARRIS: Yes, but will it destroy the weed here? 
DOCTOR: Well unfortunately no. No, we have to do battle with that ourselves. 
HARRIS: How? 
DOCTOR: With these, Mister Price. 
PRICE: With what? 
DOCTOR: If the weed attacks us here, we simply point these at it and hope for the best. Now, for heaven's sake, don't get in the way of the speakers. The sound'll cut you to pieces. HARRIS: Look there! 
DOCTOR: Give me the other two. Let's set up another two. 
PRICE: What's the current? 
DOCTOR: Come along, no time to waste. 
HARRIS: Chief! Chief, quick! 
DOCTOR: Here we are. That's it. 
JAMIE: Doctor, how many is there? I thought that there was only the one monster.

[Outside the Control hall]

(The Chief and Harris are confronted by a mass of weed creature.) 
HARRIS: Back, Chief. Back.

[Control hall]

HARRIS: Full Alert! Close all doors! 
DOCTOR: There we are. 
HARRIS: Close all doors! 
JAMIE: Those doors won't hold! 
DOCTOR: Take this and point it at the monster, but don't get in the way of it. 
HARRIS: Look out! 
(The doors bulge under the weight of the weed creature. Then suddenly they give way. The weed creature is in the doorway.) 
DOCTOR: Back, everybody. Onto the platform here. 
(Everyone gets onto the raised control platform except Price, who is frozen with fear.) 
DOCTOR: Switch it on, man, switch it on! Hold that, Jamie. Which is the connector switch? The connector switch! 
(He passes his own portable speaker to JAMIE and goes over (The Doctor shakes Price and he hits the switch.) 
DOCTOR: Come on. Switch on your speaker and point it at the creature. Switch on! Go on!
(Victoria's electronic scream rings out but the foam comes closer.)
JAMIE: What's going on?
JONES: It's not working!
DOCTOR: Give it a minute.
JONES: It's not working, I tell you. 
(The weed creature falters.) 
HARRIS: No! Look! 
(The foam begins to retreat and the creature goes back to the doorway, writhing.) 
DOCTOR: Behind you! Look behind you! The corridor! 
(The monitor shows the corridor clearing as the foam and weed ebbs away. Soon it is almost totally clear.) 
JAMIE: It worked. 
HARRIS: Doctor, it worked. 
DOCTOR: Switch off. Price! Switch off now. 
(Blissful silence.) 
PRICE: Doctor, you've done it. 
DOCTOR: Mister Price, I think you can switch it all off now. 
PRICE: What about the weed's nerve centre at the Control Rig? 
DOCTOR: What about 
PRICE: Do you think we've destroyed that? 
DOCTOR: Why don't you go and see, Mister Price. 
PRICE: Right. 
HARRIS: Price. 
PRICE: Yes, sir. 
HARRIS: Send out the company helicopters right away to the Control Rig. I want a full report right away. 
PRICE: Very good, sir. 
JONES: Well Doctor, I don't quite know what to say, except thank you. 
DOCTOR: Miss Jones, that will be more than sufficient. 
HARRIS: I still can't believe it. 
DOCTOR: What's the matter, eh? 
VICTORIA: I don't know. I'm always frightened. 
DOCTOR: Well, of course. 
VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor, I can't. 
DOCTOR: It's all right. 
VICTORIA: I can't. 
HARRIS: Doctor, they're safe! 
DOCTOR: It's all right, they're safe. 
VICTORIA: I can't. 
DOCTOR: They're safe. Listen, they're safe. Come along and see. 
HARRIS: They're all safe! We've won! Isn't it marvellous? Maggie! Maggie! Mister Robson, can you hear me? 
ROBSON [OC]: Yes, Mister Harris, we can. 
MAGGIE [OC]: Yes, darling, we can hear you. 
HARRIS: Good, good. Are you all well? Has the weed gone? 
ROBSON [OC]: The weed? Oh yes, yes, it's gone. 
HARRIS: What about Van Lutyens? I don't suppose you 
ROBSON [OC]: No, he's fine. He's well. 
MAGGIE [OC]: Darling, we're all all right, I promise you. 
HARRIS: Quiet, everybody, quiet! Mister Robson, we're sending out one of the company helicopters to you right away. You'll be back with us in less than an hour.

[Harrises' quarters]

(On the patio that evening.) 
ROBSON: Oh, I should have listened to you in the first place, Mister Harris. 
HARRIS: Oh, I doubt it would have helped. As it turned out, we were lucky we didn't tamper with the weed. 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. 
MAGGIE: We'll the next time you ask me to get something from your desk, you can do it yourself. 
ROBSON: To think I wanted to keep you locked up, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Well, lots of people have tried. 
HARRIS: They didn't want to. 
ROBSON: That was a very splendid dinner, Mrs Harris. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm very tired. 
DOCTOR: Oh, really. Oh, dear. There we are. 
ROBSON: See you in the morning, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well, no. No, as a matter of fact, we must be on our way. 
ROBSON: Oh, dear. Where are you going? 
DOCTOR: Well, we haven't quiet decided yet. 
JAMIE: Aye, even if we had it wouldn't make any difference. We wouldn't get there. Not with him. 
ROBSON: If you're ever around here again, do drop in. And in the front gate this time, just to avoid any unfortunate incidents. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I will. 
HARRIS: Good night, Mister Robson. 
ROBSON: Good night. Bye, Mrs Harris. 
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mister Robson. Well, I suppose I think it's time we went. Jamie. Victoria. 
JAMIE: Hey, Victoria. Wakey, wakey. What's the matter? 
DOCTOR: You don't want to come with us, do you, Victoria. 
VICTORIA: I don't know. I don't really want to leave you. 
DOCTOR: Well, I suspected as much. 
VICTORIA: Would you mind? 
JAMIE: Victoria, you can't 
DOCTOR: Just a minute, Jamie. You mean you want to stay here and settle down. Well, if you want to, you must. 
VICTORIA: I'm sorry. 
DOCTOR: No, that's all right. Mrs Harris, I wonder if you'd mind if Victoria stayed with you for a little while. You see, she's got no parents or home and it is a bit difficult 
MAGGIE: Well, of course. We'd be delighted to have you for as long as you want to stay. 
VICTORIA: Oh, would you? 
MAGGIE: Yes. 
DOCTOR: There, thank you very much. Jamie and I will stay for another day, just in case you want to think again. 
JAMIE: Look, we'll talk it over later. 
DOCTOR: Now, Jamie. She must make up her own mind. It's her own life. It's her decision. 
JAMIE: Aye.

[Control hall]

PRICE: Thank you, Rig D. Normal function on all channels. Control checks positive. Closing down now. All communications remain on standby. 
ROBSON: All right, Price? 
PRICE: Oh yes, thank you, sir. Back to normal. 
ROBSON: Relief? 
PRICE: Crews on their way, sir. 
ROBSON: Bet you could do with a bit of shut-eye. 
PRICE: Oh, I don't know. I think I'm a bit past it. 
ROBSON: Go out like a light, eh? 
PRICE: Probably. 
ROBSON: Chief still here? 
PRICE: Yes, in the impeller room, sir. 
ROBSON: Goodnight, Price. 
PRICE: Goodnight, sir.

[Impeller room]

ROBSON: Hello, Chief. 
CHIEF: Mister Robson. 
ROBSON: Sound as a bell, eh? 
CHIEF: Almost, sir. 
ROBSON: Almost? 
CHIEF: Still half a point off capacity. 
ROBSON: Is it? 
CHIEF: The main control valve was slightly damaged. They're working on it now. Be up to our normal output in the morning. There's still one or two minor repairs to be done. 
ROBSON: Not tonight, Chief. 
CHIEF: Well, why not? 
ROBSON: Get some sleep. Don't argue. Leave it to the relief. 
CHIEF: All right. 
ROBSON: Where do you lot think you're going? There's another three minutes before your relief arrives. 
CHIEF: Nice to know you're back to normal, sir. 
ROBSON: If I didn't know you better, Chief, I would swear you were giving me lip. 
CHIEF: Oh, I wouldn't dream of doing that, sir. 
ROBSON: Wouldn't you? Goodnight, Chief. 
CHIEF: Goodnight, sir.

[Harrises' quarters]

JAMIE: Are you not tired? 
VICTORIA: No. No, I'm fine. I'm not tired at all. 
JAMIE: Do you know what the Doctor's just gone and done? 
VICTORIA: No. 
JAMIE: He's only gone down the beach for a swim. He gets worse. You're still not sure, are you? 
VICTORIA: Yes. But it doesn't make it any easier leaving you and the Doctor. 
JAMIE: Aye, we've been together a long time now. Has the Doctor said anything to you? 
VICTORIA: No. No, you know what he's like, he wouldn't. He believes in people making up their own minds. 
JAMIE: Oh, Victoria. Do you think you'll be happy here? 
VICTORIA: Oh, I think so. The Harrises are very nice people. 
JAMIE: Yes, I know that, but they're not from your time, are they? 
VICTORIA: I wouldn't be at ease back in Victorian times. I had no parents or family left there anyway. 
JAMIE: Aye, that's true. Oh, well. 
VICTORIA: Jamie. 
JAMIE: Yes? 
VICTORIA: You wouldn't go without saying goodbye, would you? 
JAMIE: Of course not. That won't be till the morning anyway. Goodnight, Victoria. 
VICTORIA: Goodnight, Jamie. 
(They hug and kiss.)

[Beach]

(The next morning, Victoria and the Harrises say farewell to the Doctor and Jamie. The Tardis is floating offshore again so the Doctor and Jamie have to use the rubber dinghy to get to it. Jamie waves. Victoria waves back, crying, and Maggie hugs her.)

[Tardis]

(They can see Victoria on the scanner.) 
JAMIE: We can't just leave her. 
DOCTOR: We are not leaving her, Jamie. It was her decision to stay. She'll be quite all right with the Harrises. Now don't worry so much, Jamie. 
JAMIE: I'm not, I'm just. Och, come on, let's go. 
DOCTOR: Well, where would you like to go? 
JAMIE: I couldn't care less. 
DOCTOR: I was fond of her too, you know, Jamie.

[Tardis]

JAMIE: We can't just leave her. 
DOCTOR: We're not leaving her, Jamie. It was her decision to stay. She'll be perfectly all right with the Harrises. Now don't worry so much. 
JAMIE: I'm not, I'm just. Och, come on, let's go. 
DOCTOR: Well, where would you like to go? 
JAMIE: I couldn't care less. 
DOCTOR: I was fond of her too, you know, Jamie.
(The Tardis dematerialises and Victoria's image fades from the screen. Later in the flight, Jamie is dozing in a chair.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, we're landing. Jamie! 
JAMIE: Huh? 
DOCTOR: We're landing! 
JAMIE: Oh. 
DOCTOR: Let's have a look at the scanner, shall we? 
(The scanner screen is blank.) 
JAMIE: I thought you said we'd landed? 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, we are, but I seem to have lost the picture. Let's try a little bit more power, shall we? 
JAMIE: Are you sure you're pushing the right one? 
DOCTOR: Yes, of course I am. Look at the fault indicator, will you? It's round there on the left. 
JAMIE: No, it's all right here. 
DOCTOR: No movement at all? 
JAMIE: No. 
DOCTOR: Well, that's funny. The air's all right, the temperature's perfectly normal. There seems to be rather a lot of metal all around us 
JAMIE: What? Oh, you know I can't hear you when you talk to yourself. 
DOCTOR: There we are, it's coming up now. 
(A beautiful lake appears on the scanner.) 
JAMIE: Hey, now that looks all right! Boy! Look at it. Hey, what's that? 
(It's an exotic animal.) 
JAMIE: The size of it. 
DOCTOR: Well, that's funny, it's changed to night now. 
JAMIE: It's a wee bit quick, isn't it? Look, it's changed again. What's going on? 
DOCTOR: Oh dear. Those pictures aren't what's happening outside, I'm certain of that. 
JAMIE: Why do they keep appearing then? 
DOCTOR: They're temptations. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
DOCTOR: The Tardis is trying to warn us to get away from here to somewhere more pleasant. I must have pushed the wrong switch. 
JAMIE: The red light's stopped flashing. 
DOCTOR: What? 
JAMIE: Something must be wrong. 
DOCTOR: What? Well the power's overloading. The power lines are overloading! (There's a flash.) 
DOCTOR: The fluid link's gone! 
JAMIE: Doctor, look under here. 
(A toxic gas is coming from the base of the console.) 
DOCTOR: The mercury's vapourising! We've got to get out of here, come on. 
JAMIE: But how? 
(The Doctor opens a small hatch beside the main doors to reveal a golden rod with capped ends attached to a bracket.) 
DOCTOR: Hold on to me. 
JAMIE: What are you going to do? 
DOCTOR: Just hold on! 
(The Doctor grasps the rod and pulls it from its holder. The console room walls shimmer and fold in on themselves. The doors are now open and the Doctor and Jamie get out.)

[Rocket motor section]

(A cramped compartment.) 
JAMIE: Doctor, what's happened to the Tardis? 
DOCTOR: I disengaged the time vector generator. 
JAMIE: The what? 
DOCTOR: Well once removed, it alters the size of the Tardis. The inside becomes an ordinary telephone box again. Come along, come and sit over here. 
(The Doctor still has the rod, and Jamie is coughing a lot.) 
DOCTOR: If I hadn't have done, the mercury vapour would have killed us. 
JAMIE: Where are we? 
DOCTOR: It looks like the motor section of some sort of rocket. 
JAMIE: A rocket? 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. There's an artificial gravity system, too. 
JAMIE: What does that do? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's what keeps us on our feet, otherwise we'd be floating around. 
JAMIE: Oh. There's no water around, is there? 
DOCTOR: Water, no. Not in here, Jamie. There's no movement either, is there. 
JAMIE: We're on the ground, then. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I expect so. Ouch! 
JAMIE: What's the matter? Well, don't keep me in suspense, what's happened? 
(The Doctor pulls out a paper bag out of his pocket.) 
DOCTOR: Have a lemon sherbet. It'll quench your thirst. 
(The Doctor goes to examine the door of the compartment.) 
JAMIE: Doctor, the warning mechanism obviously thought there was something wrong out here, but what? I mean, everything's so, well, dead, isn't it? 
DOCTOR: Jamie. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: Look. It's a track. 
(There are marks on the floor leading under the door.) 
DOCTOR: Why, that's oil. It must be some sort of machine. It's recent, too. 
JAMIE: Well, I wonder what that would (Jamie presses a button and the door opens.) 
JAMIE: I just. Oh.

[Corridor]

(It is an empty corridor. They follow the track past two other doorways before reaching a blank metal shutter at the far end. There are controls and a monitor screen in the wall nearby.) 
JAMIE: Shall we open the door? 
DOCTOR: No. No, there may be something on the other side. Here. 
(The Doctor looks at the monitor controls and flicks a switch.) 
DOCTOR: Here we are. 
(The image of a shadow-filled control room appears on the screen. It is filled with banks of computers and control panels, but there are no people visible. There is a small coffin-shaped pod next to an airlock, with a large metal crate on the other side.) 
JAMIE: Looks safe enough. 
DOCTOR: Yes. What caused the defence mechanism of the Tardis to register danger then? And where's the crew? And what's this track? There's plenty of air in there. Let's try and get in. 
(The door won't open.) 
JAMIE: Oh. I'll look up here then. 
(Jamie goes back to the first of the two doors and opens it. There's nothing interesting inside so he closes it and goes to the other one.) 
JAMIE: Stores in that one. 
DOCTOR: It's living quarters here.

[Rocket living quarters]

(The door closes behind them. There is a bunk bed and a dispensing machine, table and two chairs.) 
JAMIE: Ah. Water! 
(Meanwhile, in the control room, a squat, squared-off robot comes out of the shadow. It has two short stubby arms and protruding antennae, and illuminated detectors instead of a face. It communicates electronically with the rocket's systems. The door opens and the robot looks out. It sees nothing and the door closes again.) 
JAMIE: I'd have thought a rocket this size would have carried more than two people. 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, it does. It carries four. Two on duty and two resting. 
JAMIE: Oh, the Tardis must have gone mad, then. I mean, there's nothing on board here, so there's no danger. 
DOCTOR: Isn't there? 
(The Doctor looks through a porthole.) 
DOCTOR: We're just drifting, Jamie. Drifting aimlessly in space. Perhaps that's what the Tardis was trying to warn us about. 
JAMIE: What's it matter? 
DOCTOR: Matter? We're just a piece of space flotsam, don't you realise that? 
JAMIE: Well all right, stick your rod dimen 
DOCTOR: Time vector generator. 
JAMIE: Aye, stick it back in, and we'll float off somewhere else. 
DOCTOR: No, it's not as simple as that, Jamie. The fluid, hmm? We need mercury to refill it, don't we. 
JAMIE: Well there must be some on board here, surely? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I hope so. 
JAMIE: Well there's got to be. 
DOCTOR: What's happened to the crew? They haven't just gone out for a little constitutional, you know. 
JAMIE: Well, we won't find that out till we look inside that control room, will we? 
(In the control room, a three-handed clock is running. The numeric display above reads 10,025 and falling.)

[Rocket motor section]

(The Doctor and Jamie have searched the ship.) 
DOCTOR: Well, I've searched my side. There's not a drop of mercury anywhere. 
JAMIE: Me, too. No, the only place we haven't searched is that control room. 
DOCTOR: Well, we'll have a breather, and then we'll try in there. 
JAMIE: And perhaps we'll find some food in that machine as well. 
DOCTOR: I can give you another lemon drop. 
JAMIE: Something a bit more substantial, please. 
DOCTOR: What do you fancy? 
JAMIE: Well right now I'd like a nice plate of roast beef with all the trimmings. 
DOCTOR: I'll see what I can do. 
JAMIE: Eh? Ah now Doctor, where are you going to find a plate of roast beef on this place?

[Rocket living quarters]

(The Doctor works the dispensing machine controls.) 
JAMIE: What are you doing? 
DOCTOR: Roast beef, you said? 
JAMIE: Well, yes. 
DOCTOR: What vegetables? 
JAMIE: Potatoes 
DOCTOR: Potatoes. 
JAMIE: And cabbage. 
DOCTOR: And cabbage. What about a drop of fruit salad? 
JAMIE: Fruit salad, yes. 
DOCTOR: And I'll have some pork, potatoes and carrots. And, I'll have a drop of ice-cream. 
(Two paper plates appear, with white cubes on them.) 
DOCTOR: There we are. what about the gravy? 
JAMIE: I don't think so. 
DOCTOR: Gravy. 
JAMIE: Am I supposed to eat this? 
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. It'll be delicious. 
JAMIE: I've heard of a square meal, but this is ridiculous. 
DOCTOR: Sit down and eat up. 
JAMIE: Doctor, what do you think Victoria's doing now? 
DOCTOR: Now? Time is relative, Jamie. If I knew when 'now' was, I might be able to hazard a guess. 
JAMIE: You know what I mean. 
DOCTOR: Well, she's decided to stay in a good historical period. Very few wars, great prosperity. She'll be happy enough. This is very filling, isn't it? 
JAMIE: Aye. Well, what do we do now? 
DOCTOR: Well, when we've digested our dinner we'll have another try to get into the control room. 
JAMIE: Oh well, while you do that, I'm going to have a wee lie down. 
(Jamie stretches out on the bunk.) 
JAMIE: Tell me, though. What do you think happened to the crew? 
DOCTOR: I don't know, Jamie. I wish I did. I suppose they've been overtaken by some disaster or other. Perhaps we'll find out when we get into the control room. (The control room door opens and the little robot comes out and goes to the open door of the motor section. It is quite slow, and is constantly taking readings of its surroundings. The Doctor is using his pocket telescope to look out of the porthole.) 
DOCTOR: Well, at least we don't seem to be in any immediate danger, Jamie. But I would like to know 
(Jamie is fast asleep.) 
(The servo-robot has reached the Tardis. In the control room, the countdown reads 1,000. A light flashes on the robot's casing. It goes into the corridor and laser-welds the motor section door shut, then returns to the control room. After listening at the cabin door, the Doctor opens it and looks into the corridor. He sees a fresh set of oily tracks on the floor and follows them to the control room door. There he turns on the wall monitor, but it is full of static. Inside, the robot connects itself to a computer bank and the rocket begins to turn. The Doctor is thrown against a wall by the movement. Jamie is tipped from the bunk, and goes to find the Doctor.)

[Corridor]

JAMIE: Doctor, what's happening? 
DOCTOR: I hit my head. Oh! 
JAMIE: We're moving. The rocket's moving. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. There's someone in the control room. 
JAMIE: Let's have a look. 
DOCTOR: No, no, Jamie. We've got to get back to the Tardis. It's the only safe place. 
JAMIE: Doctor, the mercury stuff. 
DOCTOR: Never mind that. 
(Jamie helps the groggy Doctor stand up and go to the motor section door.) 
JAMIE: It won't open. Doctor, someone's sealed the door. 
(The Doctor collapses. Jamie helps him up and into the cabin.)

[Rocket living quarters]

DOCTOR: Lock it, Jamie. Lock it. 
JAMIE: Easy. Doctor, are you all right? Doctor? 
(The Doctor has collapses onto the bunk.) 
(In the control room, the robot disconnects from the computer and goes to the pod by the airlock. They exchange electronic signals then the pod opens to reveal a row of small white spheres. The inner and outer airlock doors open and the room depressurises. The countdown has reached Zero. The spheres float out through the airlock into space. The airlock closes and the robot repressurises the control room, then goes to a large monitor screen which now shows a large space station. Its top section is flattened, like a large wheel, with a complicated lattice of rocket motors and antennae below. The robot reconnects to the computer and the rocket stops.) JAMIE: Doctor, there's a great big silver thing out here. 
DOCTOR: Into the Tardis. I've got to get him to safety. 
(Jamie is looking out of the porthole as the Doctor crawls into the corridor, takes a cap off one end of the time vector generator and points it at the sealed motor section door. A beam vapourises the seal. When he has finished, the Doctor puts the cap back on the TVG and puts the device in his pocket. Before he can open the door, he is aware of the robot right behind him.) 
JAMIE: Doctor, you must see this.

[Corridor]

(Jamie looks out of the cabin to see the robot. He grabs the metallic blanket from the bunk and throws it over the machine, which skitters away, blind.) 
JAMIE: Back to the cabin, quick!

[Rocket living quarters]

JAMIE: Easy. Easy now. 
(Outside, the robot blows the blanket off with a jet of air and heads for the cabin.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, take this. It's a gun. Like a torch. You have to be careful. 
(He gives Jamie the TVG as the robot's laser begins to burn through the cabin door. Carefully, Jamie unscrews the tip of the rod and aims it at the door. The beam hits the robot, sending it flying down to the door of the motor section where it explodes.) 
JAMIE: Oh. We're all right for the time being. But listen, you. Mo more gallivanting about till I say so, all right? Doctor? Doctor? 
(The Doctor is unconscious.)

[Wheel Operations room]

(Everyone is gathered around a man at a radio control console. He is Leo Ryan, Communications Officer.) 
RYAN: (Australian) Hold. Get a fix on that. 
CORWYN: It's not moving now. 
(Gemma Corwyn, Medical Officer.) 
LERNOV: Crossover zero. 
(Tanya Lernov, Russian.) 
RYAN: Triangulate it, Rico. How's it now. Tanya? 
CORWYN: The same. 
LERNOV: Just a slight drift. 
RYAN: No, no the movement isn't real, it's just an illusion caused by slight polar precession. 
(An older man, Commander Jarvis Bennett, enters.) 
BENNETT: How's our mystery rocket? 
CORWYN: Suddenly lifeless. 
RYAN: Doesn't make sense, sir. It must have been driven by something. 
CORWYN: No radio contact. 
BENNETT: I'm not surprised. I've just checked out its description on the register. It's a Phoenix Mark Four named Silver Carrier. 
RYAN: Tanya? 
LERNOV: The register's even. No crossover reading now. 
RYAN: No, it's definitely stopped moving. 
CORWYN: Silver Carrier? 
BENNETT: Supply ship for Station Five. Reported overdue nine weeks ago. It's only about eighty or ninety million miles off course. 
RYAN: Try radio contact again, Rico. 
CASALI: Okay. 
(Enrico Casali.) 
CASALI: Station Three to Silver Carrier. Station Three to Silver Carrier. Call sign LX88J. Repeat, LX88J. Come in, please. Nothing. 
CORWYN: It couldn't have drifted all that way, Jarvis. 
BENNETT: No, it couldn't. 
LERNOV: Try the emergency again, Leo? 
RYAN: Station Three to Silver Carrier. Pull switch with red band to operate emergency transmitter. 
CORWYN: You think their radio's gone? 
LERNOV: In case. 
BENNETT: Good procedure. I'm afraid we're wasting our time, but waste it we must. 
RYAN: Any reaction, Tanya? 
LERNOV: No, nothing. No movement at all. 
CORWYN: How does Silver Carrier turn up in this part of the cosmos? 
BENNETT: Something happens to the crew. One of them puts on the automatic. The rocket's travelled so far now, the power feedback to automatic is probably failing. 
RYAN: Yes, that's possible. 
BENNETT: It could start up and start moving again at any minute. 
CORWYN: And the crew? 
BENNETT: A dozen and one things. 
RYAN: Well, we've tried everything, sir. We can't raise a sound. 
BENNETT: Trouble is, if I'm right about that automatic, and I think I am, that rocket could suddenly accelerate and whip straight towards us. There can't be any life on board there, can there?) 
(Meanwhile the spheres drift further from the rocket and straight for the Wheel.) 
LERNOV: I'm getting something. Like small meteorites hitting our outer rim. 
(The spheres are landing on the Wheel and being absorbed into the hull.) 
LERNOV: There's another drop in air pressure. 
CORWYN: It can't be meteorites, we'd have had some warning. 
LERNOV: Well, something. Look. Jumping all over the place. 
BENNETT: It's obvious. We must take it some minor objects have escaped from the Silver Carrier. Objects of small mass and high density. 
CORWYN: Then these objects would be clinging close to the rocket, Jarvis, not descending on us. 
BENNETT: It doesn't matter, Gemma, it really doesn't. Don't start looking for mysteries. Now I can't risk that rocket homing on this station. 
CORWYN: What are you going to do? 
BENNETT: In a few moments, you're going to experience a sight rarely seen by human beings. Leo, is that projector on standby? 
RYAN: Yes, sir. Moving into position now. 
CORWYN: Jarvis, what are you going to do? 
BENNETT: Turn the X-ray laser on the Silver Carrier. In a few moments you're going to witness the complete destruction of a rocket in space. 
Episode Two

[Wheel Operations room]

CASALI: On Red band emergency frequency, come in, please. Come in, please. Station Three to Silver Carrier, Station Three to Silver Carrier. On Red band emergency frequency, come in please. 
BENNETT: All ready, Leo? 
RYAN: Yes, sir. It's locked on now. 
BENNETT: That's it. Don't get much fun, do we? Better make the most of it. 
RYAN: Make a change from blasting meteorites, wouldn't it? 
CORWYN: Jarvis? 
BENNETT: Hold it a minute. Tanya, can we take a visual recording of it? 
LERNOV: Yes sir, can do. 
RYAN: Still no movement or radio ,signals sir. 
BENNETT: Put up the anti-magnetic shield, Leo, when I give the word. 
RYAN: Right. 
CASALI: Still going to plan, sir. 
BENNETT: Good, I'll do an announcement about reverberations. 
CORWYN: Before you do that, Jarvis, can I have a word? It's important. 
CASALI: More bogeys. 
(Corwyn and Bennett move away.) 
RYAN: All systems on green. Stand by. 
ALL: Green. Stand by. 
LERNOV: I don't know what you grinning about. 
RYAN: Neither do I. 
LERNOV: It isn't funny, Leo. The Controller's like a kid with a new toy. 
RYAN: Oh, don't tell me you're going to be a old stick in the mud, too? 
LERNOV: If you are referring to Doctor Corwyn, she is known. She is no stick in the mud. She's perfectly right to be cautious. 
RYAN: Come on, Tanya. It's off course about eighty million miles. I mean, there can't possibly be anyone alive on the thing. 
(On the Silver Carrier, Jamie is trying to shine a signal light out of the cabin porthole. He pulls the light to far and the cable comes out, putting the room into darkness. He sees a small glow by the Doctor. It is the Time Vector Generator. Jamie holds it up to the porthole.)

[Corwyn's office]

CORWYN: Yes, I know all that, Jarvis, but we still can't be absolutely certain. 
BENNETT: Gemma, one thing that I beg of you. Don't subject me to psychoanalysis. You think I'm having a whale of a time, don't you? All kids again. Bang, bang, blow up the balloon. You're wrong, you know. 
CORWYN: Am I? 
BENNETT: Say what you like, the Silver Carrier is a menace to the Wheel. Now surely you can see that? 
CORWYN: If you equate menace with automatic power drive, I don't. 
BENNETT: What else? 
CORWYN: You want me to believe some emergency happened on the Silver Carrier. The pilot switched to automatic and then tragedy. 
BENNETT: Right. 
CORWYN: And all the crew died? 
BENNETT: Right again. 
CORWYN: Where was the Carrier bound for, Jarvis? 
BENNETT: Servicing Station Five. I told you. 
CORWYN: Then isn't it be reasonable to assume that the automatic would have taken it to Station Five? 
BENNETT: Yes, that's good reasoning. But you're forgetting the emergency. That could have damaged the control sensors. In fact, it must have done, which is why the rocket is so far off course. 
CORWYN: Assumption again, guesswork. It would be so easy to check. 
BENNETT: We can't risk that rocket turning in on us. Don't you see? It'd blast a hole right through us! 
(Jamie takes the cap off the TVG.)

[Wheel Operations room]

(The Radio operator rips his headphones off in pain.) 
RYAN: What the matter? 
RUDKIN: Noise! Fantastic noise through my headphones. 
LERNOV: Leo! The approach indicators are all at red! 
RYAN: What's causing it? Green system's gone crazy. Tanya, get Doctor Corwyn. Check emergency system yellow. 
CASALI: Emergency yellow, negative. 
WOMAN: Transfer internal communications to my cell. 
RYAN: Bill! 
DUGGAN: Yo! 
RYAN: Will you lie him down there? 
CASALI: Hey, hey, hey, you don't want to do that again. 
RYAN: Hey, listen! 
(The interference can be heard coming through the headsets.)

[Corwyn's office]

BENNETT: Don't argue with me, Gemma. The decision is mine! This station and the people on it are my responsibility. 
LERNOV: Rudkin's hurt! 
CORWYN: What happened? 
LERNOV: Colossal static pulses swamping the detectors. 
BENNETT: It's the rocket. I knew it was a menace. (Jamie uses the cap of the TVG to create a pulsed signal.)

[Wheel Operations room]

(Bennett, Corwyn and Lernov enter.) 
BENNETT: All right, Tanya, get back to the complex. See if you can pin this static down. 
BENNETT: Vallance, Casali, here. Well? 
CORWYN: It's bad. 
BENNETT: Can we move him? 
CORWYN: Yes. 
BENNETT: Right. You two, take him to the Medical Bay. 
CORWYN: Gently with him, now. 
(Rudkin is carried out.) 
BENNETT: Your attention. That rocket has given us enough trouble. Bill, knock it out. 
DUGGAN: Right, sir. 
LERNOV: Controller! 
BENNETT: Yes, what is it? 
LERNOV: The static. There's a signal on it. 
BENNETT: There can't be. 
RYAN: You're right, Tanya. Get me a fix on that. 
LERNOV: If I can. It's not any code that I've ever heard before but there's definitely a repetitive order to it. 
RYAN: It's no good using radio or radar. We will have to use millimicron waves. 
BENNETT: You think it's coming from the rocket? 
RYAN: Just want to make sure that it's not coming from anywhere else. 
LERNOV: The rocket. It is! 
BENNETT: You're sure? 
LERNOV: Certain. I was fixed on it anyway. There's no doubt. 
BENNETT: Then somebody is on board. Phil! 
PHIL: Sir. 
BENNETT: I want two men to cross over. Organise it, will you? 
PHIL: Right sir. 
BENNETT: Eighty million miles off course. If they're alive on board that craft, they must be in a pretty bad way.

[Silver Carrier]

(After a little while, Jamie stops signalling and checks on the Doctor. He is still unconscious, so he returns to the porthole to see a space-suited figure looking in. The newcomer gestures towards the front of the rocket. Jamie goes to the control room but the door is locked. Two men have already entered through the airlock. They repressurise the control room and the door opens.) 
JAMIE: Quick, I've somebody injured in here.

[Wheel Operations room]

(Laleham, an American, has taken over as radio operator.) 
LALEHAM: Voyager five, call sign K-1 2 10-Q. Confirm please, Station 3. 
VOICE [OC]: Receiving you, Station 3. Hello, hello? 
LALEHAM: Light to medium meteorite storm across your planned route between thirteen hundred fourteen hundred hours. Coordinates: A alpha 2710 point 4, B beta 4 point 7. Do you receive Voyager Five? 
VOICE [OC]: Yes, thank you for the information, Station 3. 
LALEHAM: We have computed an alternative route for you, Voyager Five. Stand by for instructions. 
VOICE [OC]: Computer standing by now. 
RYAN: How are the guests? 
LERNOV: Doctor Corwyn's examining the older one now. They're both slightly in shock anyway. 
RYAN: What's the story? 
LERNOV: I don't know. Quite a mystery, isn't it. 
RYAN: Jarvis won't like that. What that on green system three, Chang? 
CHANG: (Oriental) Very odd, sir. Been getting one or two funny signs here and there all the time. Soon as you check them out they vanish. 
RYAN: Put them in the log, okay? 
CHANG: Yes, sir. It as if a number of magnets were touching the outer skin of the wheel and then letting go. Localised field effects, that's all. 
MAN: All detector fields are checked out, sir. Can't be anything serious. 
RYAN: Well, keep a log and let me know. 
MAN: Right, sir. 
RYAN: More mysteries. 
LERNOV: I know. 
RYAN: Something else worrying you, Tanya? 
LERNOV: What about those sudden drops in air pressure levels? They were small enough and soon adjust themselves but I didn't like it. 
RYAN: How small? 
LERNOV: Only a few millimetres. One degree, sometimes one and a half. 
RYAN: Hmm. Some fault in the air supply unit, or the pumps. 
LERNOV: In so many different parts of the Wheel? 
RYAN: Did you tell Jarvis? 
LERNOV: Of course. He bit my head off. 
RYAN: And have you told Gemma Corwyn yet? 
LERNOV: No, she was busy with the new arrivals. I didn't like to disturb her. 
RYAN: Well, if I were you Tanya, I start a check on the whole air supply unit. 
LERNOV: That's what I thought. Leo? 
RYAN: Hmm? 
LERNOV: None of these things. Your system showing temporary faults, the air pressure levels. Well, they all started with the rocket, didn't they? 
RYAN: What, you think there are little green men on board, do you? 
LERNOV: Well, the two they bought back wasn't exactly normal, were they? 
RYAN: Well, I tell you what, hey? If you get scared, I'll let you hold my hand. Okay? 
LERNOV: I'm serious. 
RYAN: So am I. 
(More of the spheres from the rocket are getting through the outer hull of the wheel.)

[Medical rest room]

(Jamie is baring his chest for a check-up.) 
CORWYN: Breathe in again. Out. In again please. Out. Now, I want you to take a deep breath and exhale as slowly as you can. Good. You can dress now. 
JAMIE: How about the Doctor? 
CORWYN: Concussion, certainly. I am waiting for the X-Rays to see if there's any fracture. What were you both up to? 
JAMIE: Hey? 
CORWYN: Fancy dress or something? Your clothes. 
JAMIE: Look, have you ever thought what you look like walking down the street in those things. People would think you were a wee bit strange as well. 
CORWYN: I dare say. But I don't understand the analogy. We're both in space. It's you and your friend who aren't conforming to custom. 
JAMIE: How about the medical? Do I pass? 
CORWYN: You'll do. If it's any comfort to you, you are in fine physical shape. Can you give me your full name please? JAMIE: James Robert McCrimmon. Jamie. 
CORWYN: Thank you. And your friend? 
JAMIE: Er, the Doctor. 
CORWYN: I can't put that down. 
JAMIE: Er. John Smith. 
CORWYN: Really? 
JAMIE: Aye. 
(Corwyn sees that her medical equipment was manufactured by John Smith and Associates.) 
CORWYN: Doctor John Smith. 
JAMIE: They must be a lot of them about. 
CORWYN: I dare say. You were passengers aboard the Silver Carrier, were you? 
JAMIE: Er, do you think that I could have a drink of water, please? 
CORWYN: What happened to the crew? 
JAMIE: I don't know. 
CORWYN: Could you go further than that? 
JAMIE: Well, I was ill in the cabin, you see. A terrible fever. Raving for days. Well, when I came to, the door was closed against us, the Doctor was hurt and your people came. 
CORWYN: All the communicating doors were closed against you? 
JAMIE: Aye. 
CORWYN: And your friend didn't tell you what happened? 
JAMIE: No. 
CORWYN: All right, Jamie, that'll do for the present. The Controller will want to have a chat with you. We'll have to get you home somehow. 
JAMIE: Aye, that'll be the day. Oh, of course. 
CORWYN: There should be another ship passing through in a week or two. 
JAMIE: Oh, can I go now? 
CORWYN: You didn't drink your water. 
JAMIE: No, well, that's all right. 
CORWYN: Wait a moment. 
JAMIE: What? 
CORWYN: Would you like to see over the Wheel? I could arrange it for you, if you like. 
JAMIE: Oh, yes. I mean, there's nothing else to do. 
CORWYN: Well, if you go along the corridor you'll see a door marked Parapsychology library. 
JAMIE: Para what? 
CORWYN: It's on the other side of the Wheel complex, about eight sections on. I'll tell Zoe to show you round. 
JAMIE: Zoe? 
CORWYN: She's our. Well, the best way to describe her would be to call her our librarian. 
JAMIE: Zoe, you say? 
CORWYN: That's right. 
JAMIE: Oh, you will tell me what happens to the Doctor. 
CORWYN: Yes, of course. 
JAMIE: Thank you. 
(Jamie leaves. Corwyn turns on a monitor.) 
CORWYN: Parapsychology library, Doctor Corwyn calling. 
(A young dark-haired girl answers.) 
ZOE [on monitor]: Parapsychology library. What reference do you require, Doctor Corwyn? 
CORWYN: No reference, thank you, Zoe. I need your help in another way. 
ZOE [on monitor]: Oh? 
CORWYN: One of the people retrieved from the rogue spaceship is coming to your section. I'd like you to show him over the Wheel and observe him. 
ZOE [on monitor]: Observe him? 
CORWYN: Discreetly, of course. 
ZOE [on monitor]: Do you want these observations recorded? 
CORWYN: Yes, please. 
ZOE [on monitor]: Hmm, should be interesting. Any facts known? 
CORWYN: Yes. He is a nice lad. His name's Ja 
ZOE [on monitor]: Just a minute. Sorry, I was halfway through a RNA analysis when you came on. Right. 
(Jamie is walking along the corridor looking for a long and complex word on a door. He finds one and pushes the door open)

[Parapsychology library]

(It is dominated by a large circular desk with Zoe is seated in the middle.) 
ZOE: With the exception of the Hercules cluster. Confirmation of the information received that one of the stars in the Messier 13 group is entering a nova phase. This will be a repetition of the phenomenon observed in the Perseus cluster last week. Information of the gamma radiation level is available. 
(Zoe turns off the recorder.) 
ZOE: Sorry. You must be (laughs) 
JAMIE: What are you laughing at? 
ZOE: Your clothes. You're wearing female garments. 
JAMIE: Female? Look, I'll have you know this is a kilt. Have you not seen it before? 
ZOE: Kilt? Kilt. A barbaric form of garment as worn by a kiltie! Are you of Scandinavian origin? Danish? 
JAMIE: No, I am not. I am a true bred Scot and I'll just thank you to 
ZOE: Oh, a Scot. Scotland, of course. Pre-century history isn't my field, you see. 
JAMIE: Aye, maybe not, but just you watch your lip or I'll put you across my knee and larrup you. 
ZOE: Oh, this is going to be fun. I shall learn a lot from you. Come on, James Robert McCrimmon. Do you know anything about interstellar flora? 
JAMIE: Eh?

[Power room]

(They meet Bill Duggan.) 
DUGGAN: And this is my little kingdom. Hey, how do you like the Greenhouse? 
JAMIE: Do you collect these? 
DUGGAN: No, they're floating seeds. The only place they flourish is down here in the power room. Of course, the old man kicked up a mad dust storm at first, but Doc Corwyn said it was good psychology or something. Anyway, I just like flowers. Hey, that one comes all the way from Venus. Can you imagine that? All those millions of miles away. 
ZOE: 24,564,000 miles at perihelion and 161,350,000 miles at aphelion. 
JAMIE: Oh, I was dying to know that. 
DUGGAN: And this is the capacitator bank for the x-ray lasers. 
JAMIE: The what? 
DUGGAN: Oh, it controls the laser gun. Without it the gun's useless. 
JAMIE: What do you need a gun for up in space anyway? 
DUGGAN: Self-defence. We can blot out any attacker up to ten thousand miles in any one direction. Good eh? 
JAMIE: Reassuring. 
DUGGAN: Yeah, and they're the anti-magnetic field generators. They can vend off even a medium-sized meteorite up to fifty miles. 
JAMIE: You know, Bill, the Doctor'll love all this. 
ZOE: This Doctor friend of yours. Is he a scientist? 
JAMIE: He is in a way, I suppose, yes. 
ZOE: What's his specialty? 
JAMIE: He's what? 
ZOE: Well, is he a physicist, biochemist, astronomer, biometrician 
JAMIE: Yes, he is. 
DUGGAN: Well, he certainly sounds a interesting character, this Doctor friend of yours. When is he going to be up and about?

[Corwyn's office]

CORWYN: If he is just suffering from concussion, not too long. 
BENNETT: Oh, it doesn't tell me much. I want facts. 
CORWYN: I don't blame you. 
BENNETT: We're landed with a couple of strays. Panic, mysteries from the crew. The routine's getting shoddy and I don't like it. 
CORWYN: What panics? 
BENNETT: Oh, nothing, nothing. I'll tell you if it gets serious. People are just edgy. Out in space, human beings have got to rely on routines, ordinariness. Confuse them and you got trouble. 
CORWYN: Yes. 
BENNETT: I'm used to emergencies. Trained in them. But these things? I don't know 
CORWYN: What you call mysteries? 
BENNETT: Exactly, exactly. I don't want to know, Gemma. I don't want to know. Well, you see. 
CORWYN: You'd better hear my preliminary report on the boy. 
BENNETT: Yes, go ahead. 
CORWYN: He's lying. Not completely and apparently reluctantly. He's very fit both mentally and physically, nice constructive personality. His blood pressure suggests he's not been in space very long. 
BENNETT: Lies about what? 
CORWYN: He said he had fever aboard the Silver Carrier. He hadn't. His gamma globulins are normal. 
BENNETT: Oh? Why should he lie about that? 
CORWYN: I asked him what happened to the crew. Fever was his excuse for not knowing. And then again he lied. At least, I almost sure he lied about his friend's name. John Smith, he called him. 
BENNETT: Well, they do exist, you know. 
CORWYN: Yes, he was looking at that for long enough. Coincidence possibly. Somehow I doubt it. And then, what's the most precious thing in deep space, Jarvis? 
BENNETT: Air, water, take your pick. 
CORWYN: Exactly. In space training even for one journey travellers. He asked me for a drink of water and then he left it. He might have been on Earth. That boy's has no space travel training, Jarvis. He's probably a stowaway, or he may be an agent. 
BENNETT: Sabotage? 
CORWYN: Plenty of people on Earth think we should suspend the space programme. Some of them have forced their opinions already. 
BENNETT: Do you think these two could have stowed away somehow, even disposed of the crew of the Silver Carrier, pretended to drift here helplessly, we take them in and they start breaking things up? 
CORWYN: I don't go that far. 
BENNETT: Well of course, it's fits! Everything fits! 
CORWYN: I only suggested it as a possibility, Jarvis. There are others. 
BENNETT: We'll talk about those later. This could be serious. 
CORWYN: Jarvis, wait. I

[Wheel Operations room]

ZOE: And this is the Operations and Communications room. 
JAMIE: What does this Wheel thing do up here anyway? 
ZOE: Well, it has varied functions, but mainly it's a radio-visual relay for Earth, a half-way house for deep space ships, a space research station, stellar early warning station for all types of space phenomena and 
JAMIE: Aye, well, ask a silly question. 
ZOE: Not there. That's the Controller's chair. 
RYAN: Hey, you're in for quite a treat. 
JAMIE: I am? 
DUGGAN: The old man's going ahead then? 
RYAN: Too right he is. 
LERNOV: I thought Gemma talked him out of it. 
RYAN: No, only because she thought there might still be somebody on board. Just as well for you. 
JAMIE: I'm sorry, I lost you in the first part. 
ZOE: The Controller, Jarvis Bennett, wanted to destroy the rocket. 
LERNOV: And then we got your message. 
RYAN: Only minutes in it too. The laser was all primed and ready to blast. 
LERNOV: Has Jarvis given the go-ahead? 
RYAN: Yes, I've run a new co-ordinate fix. Everything's programmed and ready. All we need now is the final signal. 
JAMIE: Oh, you're not going to blow up the rocket, then? 
RYAN: Well, it might hit us, so to be on the safe side we blast it out of existence. 
LERNOV: Jarvis asked me to make a visual recording of it. I'd better re-position. Zoe, help me do a quick mental calculation, would you? You're quicker than me. 
RYAN: It'll be great to see this at leisure. It should be quite an explosion. 
LERNOV: Right, Zoe? Lineal reading is 198.42 metres at 23 degrees latitude. 190.03 metres. 24 degree latitude. 
(Jamie leaves quietly and goes back to the power room. There he finds the x-ray laser's capacitator bank, but doesn't notice some small twisted pieces of metal on the floor. Jamie searches a shelf of bottles and canisters.)

[Wheel Operations room]

BENNETT: But he was definitely here? 
ZOE: Yes, he just vanished. 
BENNETT: Bill, any ideas? 
DUGGAN: No, sir. He was here with us. We were showing him around. 
BENNETT: Where? 
DUGGAN: Well, the power house 
BENNETT: The power house. 
DUGGAN: Yes, sir. 
BENNETT: Look, Bill, not a word to the others. Just follow me in a moment or two. Zoe, not a word. 
ZOE: Right, sir. 
(Bennett leaves.) 
RYAN: Don't look at me, I don't know what's going on. 
LERNOV: Problems? 
RYAN: I don't know. 
DUGGAN: It's all in the mind, dear, it's all in the mind. I'll see you. 
(Duggan leaves.) 
LERNOV: What was the Controller talking to Bill Duggan about, Zoe? 
ZOE: Nothing important. At least I don't think so. I don't know. Does it matter? (Zoe leaves.) 
RYAN: Hey, what's all the whispering about? 
LERNOV: I wish I knew. Leo, did I ever tell you about my nose? 
RYAN: Your nose? 
LERNOV: Yes. It's like a barometer. It never lets me down. 
RYAN: Oh. 
LERNOV: I smell trouble. 
RYAN: Can you pin point it? 
LERNOV: Hmm. It's something to do with that rocket out there. There's something sinister about it.

[Rocket control room]

(Two larger egg-like spheres are in a corner. The clock is counting up this time. Suddenly, power cables spring to life, taking power from the consoles. The spheres begin to grow, their skins glowing and becoming translucent to reveal a humanoid shape curled up inside. One of the spheres bursts open to reveal a silver three-fingered fist.)

Episode Three

(From the Lost in Time DVD)

[Wheel Operations room]

(Silver Carrier is on the monitor.) 
LERNOV: My nose never lets me down. 
RYAN: Well, don't overwork it, eh? I mean, it's rather pretty. Too much exercise might damage its shape. 
LERNOV: If something happens, don't say I didn't warn you. That's rocket dangerous. 
RYAN: Nah, not for long. As soon as Jarvis gives the word, the laser'll blast it out of existence.

[Power room]

(Jamie spots a spray labelled Quick-set plastic on a shelf. He takes it to the capacitator, pulls a section out and sprays the stuff on it before pushing it back. The machine slows down. Then he is grabbed before he can do it to another piece of the machine.) 
BENNETT: Red-handed. 
JAMIE: No, wait, let me explain 
DUGGAN: What do you think you're doing, you fool! 
BENNETT: Oh, he's no fool, are you. You're a saboteur! 
JAMIE: No, I'm not! I'm 
BENNETT: Shut up! 
(Duggan tries to remove the plastic with another spray.) 
DUGGAN: It's no good. He's wrecked it. 
BENNETT: Completely? 
DUGGAN: Yeah. 
BENNETT: Watch him. 
JAMIE: All right. I won't give you any trouble. 
DUGGAN: Too right, you won't! 
(Bennett makes a broadcast.) 
BENNETT: Now hear this. This is the Controller.

[Corwyn's office]

(Zoe and Corwyn listen.) 
BENNETT [OC]: All men on Security duty to issue themselves with sidearms at once. Easy Yellow security plan to be put into effect immediately. Two off-duty men, security

[Wheel Operations room]

BENNETT [OC]: Section, report to the power room on the double! 
RYAN: Easy Yellow? Well now what's the sudden panic? 
LERNOV: I told you Bill and the Controller were up to something. 
RYAN: I'd better log out the blasters. Keep a eye on the Hercules cluster, will you? Zoe thinks one of the stars in Messier 13 is about to enter the nova state. 
LERNOV: That's all we need! A star blowing into a thousand pieces. I told you my nose never lets me down.

[Rocket control room]

(Two fully 'grown' Cybermen have hatched from those spheres. They get instructions from a strange cybernetic creature via the monitors.) 
PLANNER [on monitor]: Report. 
CYBERMAN 1: Phase one complete. 
PLANNER [on monitor]: Cybermats are launched. 
CYBERMAN 1: Phase two complete. 
PLANNER [on monitor]: You are undetected on the rocket? 
CYBERMAN 1: Phase three ready. 
PLANNER [on monitor]: Report again after phase three.

[Corridor]

VOICE [OC]: All sections, Easy Yellow alert. 
CORWYN: You'd better check your theory, Zoe. 
ZOE: Oh, I'm right. Hercules 208 in Messier 13 is definitely on the blink. I can tell you what the radiation affect will be on Earth, if you like. 
CORWYN: Not now. 
ZOE: I suppose you're going to see the fun, whatever it is. 
CORWYN: Somehow, I don't think this is fun.

[Power room]

(Two guards are holding Jamie as Duggan checks the capacitator.) 
DUGGAN: Yeah, I see. 
BENNETT: Well? 
DUGGAN: Yeah. 
BENNETT: Well? 
DUGGAN: You've done a good job, boy. 
BENNETT: What's the exact damage? 
DUGGAN: Serious, sir. All of the primary relay contacts are fused shut. This whole unit'll have to be stripped down. 
BENNETT: How long? 
DUGGAN: Well, that depends on how much plastic he used and how far down it went. 
BENNETT: How long? 
DUGGAN: I honestly don't know, Chief. 
BENNETT: Well surely you can give me some idea? Without the laser beams, we're virtually helpless. 
DUGGAN: All right, well, let's assume the worst, that the laser's absolutely finished. I mean, this charged storage part of it. A replacement could take a week. 
BENNETT: A week? 
(Corwyn enters.) 
CORWYN: What's the trouble, Jarvis? 
BENNETT: This young idiot has ruined the laser. Poured quick-seal plastic right into the relay lines of the booster mirrors! 
CORWYN: Why? 
BENNETT: Sabotage! 
JAMIE: No. 
BENNETT: What are you? One of these pull back to Earth maniacs? Where are your friends, eh? Out there in deep space just waiting to come in and attack us when you put our laser out of action? 
JAMIE: Och, you're talking rubbish! 
DUGGAN: You can't deny anything, boy. We saw you. 
JAMIE: I'm not denying it. 
CORWYN: Is the laser really out of action, Jarvis? 
BENNETT: Yes, it is. 
CORWYN: Zoe's calculated a new star going nova. We haven't checked with radar yet but she's usually right. 
BENNETT: How bad? 
CORWYN: The radiation flux will swing the Perseus shower right in on us. With the laser we could at least knock some of them out. 
DUGGAN: Hey, I'd better get started. 
BENNETT: We must confirm Zoe's figures with the radar computers. Come on, bring him. 
(Duggan makes a broadcast as Bennett, Corwyn, Jamie and his guards leave.) 
DUGGAN: All hands to the power room. Immediate and urgent. All hands to the power room. Oh, what a mess. 
(A Cybermat enters.) 
DUGGAN: Well, I'll be. Hey. Hey, hang on. Hang on, I'm not going to hurt you. Well, where did you spring from? You're metal. Hey, you're a strange little creature, aren't you? Some form of space bug? 
(There are footsteps outside. Duggan picks up the Cybermat and puts it in a cupboard.) 
DUGGAN: Well, Billy, we'd better hide you, Billy Bug, or they'll think that I've gone bonkers. 
(Two men enter.) 
DUGGAN: Ah. Lets get started right away, shall we?

{Wheel Operations room]

BENNETT: Confirm Zoe's figures on radar computers two and five. You didn't let yourself know what you're letting yourself in for, did you? Have you ever been in a sky station when a meteorite hits? 
JAMIE: Look, I'm sorry. 
CORWYN: Why did you do it? 
JAMIE: Well, they said that you were going to blow up the rocket. 
BENNETT: So? 
CORWYN: Why not? 
JAMIE: Well, I couldn't let you, that's all. 
BENNETT: Why? Why? 
JAMIE: Because the Doctor told me to protect it.

[Rest room]

(The Doctor is sitting up against an angled bed. There's a padded silver chair in the corner and monitoring equipment nearby.) 
DOCTOR: Well that's marvellous, isn't it? The Doctor told me to protect it. You don't give a reason, just leave me to get you out of trouble. 
JAMIE: Well, I had to stop them destroying the rocket, didn't I? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I suppose so. 
JAMIE: Of course I did. I mean, what about the Tardis? A fine thing if they'd blown that to pieces. 
DOCTOR: I was just beginning to enjoy this little rest. 
JAMIE: Anyway, what are you going to tell them? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. Jamie, what exactly did happen on the rocket? Well don't look at me like that. 
JAMIE: You don't remember? 
DOCTOR: It's a bit hazy. 
JAMIE: Well, I found you lying in the corridor near that locked control room. Something had just shaken up the rocket and tumbled me out of bed and, well, whatever it was must have made you stumble as well. 
DOCTOR: I suppose I hit my head. 
JAMIE: You honestly can't remember? 
DOCTOR: No, but it's there. It's there at the back of my mind. 
JAMIE: Well, what about the machine then? The one that was going to attack you. Now surely you remember that? 
DOCTOR: Machine? No. But there's something. Some warning, some menace.

[Rocket control room].

PLANNER [on monitor]: Report progress. 
CYBERMAN 1: All phases proceeding as planned. 
PLANNER [on monitor]: Prepare phase four.

[Wheel Operations room]

CASALI: Yes. Yes, it's all happening in the Hercules cluster okay. 
ZOE: I told you. The same thing happened in the Perseus cluster a week ago. 
LERNOV: Except we had the laser then. We could deflect the meteorites. 
CASALI: Picture. There it is. And beginning to emit hard gamma already. 
(The dots are on the radar screen.) 
RYAN: It's bigger than the Perseus one, Rico. 
CASALI: It's four magnitudes up. Well, I see if I can get some further information for you. 
RYAN: I'd better give the bad news to the Controller. 
LERNOV: Leo, what we going to do if Bill can't repair the laser in time? 
RYAN: Well, we've got the convolute force field. 
ZOE: The neutron barriers won't help us. A star of this magnitude when it goes nova, deflects meteorites with a mass of two hundred tons each. 
LERNOV: Two hundred 
ZOE: At least. 
RYAN: Aren't you ever wrong? 
ZOE: Rarely. 
RYAN: No, it's all a problem in solid geometry to you, isn't it. Don't you care what happens here? 
ZOE: Well, of course. I'm only telling you what's going to happen. 
RYAN: Just like a robot. Fact, calculations. 
LERNOV: Leo! 
RYAN: Proper little brainchild. All brain and no heart!

[Power room]

(The plasticised unit is being removed.) 
DUGGAN: Gently now, gently. Keep it upright. Good, good. Fine, get maintenance started on that right away, will you? 
(The technicians leave. Duggan spots the Cybermat by the cupboard.) 
DUGGAN: Hello Billy-bug. You should had stay where I 
(He picks up a piece of debris by a box labelled Bernalium.) 
DUGGAN: Hey, did you do this? (He opens the cupboard and the Cybermat scurries away.) 
DUGGAN: What have you done? 
(Rudkin enters) 
RUDKIN: What's the matter? 
DUGGAN: What? Oh, nothing. How's it going? 
RUDKIN: Okay now. Doctor Corwyn's taken me off communications. 
DUGGAN: Good. Good. 
RUDKIN: The Controller asked me to come and see how you were getting along. 
DUGGAN: Ohm you can tell him we're making good time. Er, hey, come on, will you do something for me? 
RUDKIN: Yes? 
DUGGAN: Go into to Spares and ask them to check their Bernalium stock, will you? 
RUDKIN: Right. 
(Rudkin leaves. Duggan checks the boxes in the cupboard.) 
DUGGAN: Well, that's all right, anyway. I'll murder that little pest. 
(Duggan goes to work on the laser and two Cybermats come out from the broken box.)

[Rest room]

(Corwyn is using the John Smith device to check the Doctor.) 
CORWYN: You and your friend are healthy specimens, aren't you. 
DOCTOR: Oh, we keep fit one way and another. I suppose all this mean I've got to get up. 
CORWYN: No, I'm afraid not just yet. 
DOCTOR: Oh good. 
CORWYN: Does your head ache? 
DOCTOR: Well, it did, but it's better now. 
CORWYN: Any loss of memory? 
DOCTOR: Well, just a little. 
CORWYN: Does it make you anxious? 
DOCTOR: I think you'll find my psyche in very good order. 
CORWYN: Probably, but don't strain to remember. Concussion can bring about temporary lapses in memory. There is quite a lot we don't know about the memory bank yet, you know. Good. I suppose the part that you can't remember is why you told Jamie to protect the rocket. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I can, perfectly. We're not saboteurs, you know. 
CORWYN: Probably not. 
DOCTOR: The last thing we want to do is to interfere with what you're doing here, or put you in any danger. You saved our lives on that rocket and we're very grateful. 
CORWYN: But you have interfered. We are in the path of a very serious meteorite storm, the second we've been threatened with in a week. Only we have no defence against this new one. 
JAMIE: But I tell you, I didn't know about the meteorites. 
CORWYN: I hope not. 
JAMIE: I don't even know what they are. 
(Zoe enters.) 
ZOE: Is it all right? The guard said you are here. 
DOCTOR: Guard? 
CORWYN: We can't let you roam about wherever you want to. 
JAMIE: Aye, we're under arrest. 
DOCTOR: Oh, no. 
ZOE: How did you pilot the rocket, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I don't think we've met, have we? 
CORWYN: Zoe, Doctor John Smith, isn't it? 
JAMIE: John. (nudging the Doctor) John. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, yes. And what do you do here, Zoe? 
ZOE: I'm an astrophysicist. Pure mathematics major. 
CORWYN: With honours. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I am impressed. 
CORWYN: We use Zoe as our second opinion. 
ZOE: You didn't answer my question. 
DOCTOR: What question? 
JAMIE: You know, I'm surprised you didn't know the answer. Now don't tell me there's something you can't work out. 
ZOE: How did you pilot the rocket ship? You see, I've calculated its original course. It was a service and supply station for number five station, overdue and presumed lost nine weeks ago. Well, the rocket couldn't drift eighty seven million miles off course. 
DOCTOR: So what's your theory? 
ZOE: Well, there's a record of the last contract with the Silver Carrier rocket. It had seven million miles to touchdown and enough fuel for twenty million. Well, it couldn't have drifted here off course in the time involved. It must have been driven and piloted. 
JAMIE: Oh, a right wee space detective. 
ZOE: There's only one solution. That rocket was re-fuelled in space. Provided with at least with another twelve fuel rods. 
DOCTOR: Well, it's an interesting theory. 
ZOE: Oh, it isn't a theory. You can't disprove the facts. It's pure logic. 
DOCTOR: Logic, my dear Zoe, merely enables one to be wrong with authority. Supposing there was a faulty automatic pilot. 
ZOE: To drive a rocket eighty seven million miles on fuel for twenty million? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's a possibility. 
ZOE: That rocket was driven here somehow. I know it was.

[Rocket control room]

(On the Silver Carrier, things are moving along.) 
PLANNER [on monitor]: We have ionised a star. Perseid meteorites will strike the Wheel. 
CYBERMAN 2: Phrase three is in operation. 
PLANNER [on monitor]: The Cybermats will consume Bernalium. Without Bernalium the Wheel cannot deflect the meteorites. 
CYBERMAN 1: They will discover Bernalium on board this rocket-ship. 
CYBERMAN 2: Phrase four is ready. 
PLANNER [on monitor]: Remove telemeter control from Cybermats. (Transmission ends. Cyberman 1 zaps the clock face and the third hand starts whizzing around as the ammeter needle maxes out, switches flick and lights blink. On the Wheel, the Cybermat's eyes flash.)

[Corwyn's office]

CORWYN: Let me get this right, Bill. You say the Bernalium is 
DUGGAN: Gemma, it's useless. All of it. 
CORWYN: What about the reserve? 
DUGGAN: Yeah. I had a check made of the stock but then I remembered I'm holding most of it over in the Power room. Well, you know how much we rely on those Bernalium rods. I mean, they're the only ones that stand up inside the X-ray laser. 
CORWYN: I'm far more interested in these creatures of yours. 
DUGGAN: Oh, there's only one of them. At least, that's all I've found. 
CORWYN: Did anyone else see it? 
DUGGAN: No. 
CORWYN: Did you tell anybody else about it? 
DUGGAN: Oh, you're joking. Look, they think I'm a nut anyway for messing about with space flora. How do you think they're going to react if I tell them I found a space bug. 
CORWYN: What's it like? 
DUGGAN: Oh, it's smallish, about so big. Made of metal or some light tensile material. 
CORWYN: And you say that it eat metal? 
DUGGAN: No, not exactly. It's sort of draws the life out of it, you know. Corrodes it. You should see what it's done to the Bernalium stock. 
CORWYN: But how did this space bug get into the Wheel in the first place? 
DUGGAN: You can search me, I just found it. It could have gone through one of the loading bays or one of the airlocks. 
CORWYN: Yes, I suppose that's possible. 
DUGGAN: What's the matter? You think I am a nut too, do you? 
CORWYN: No, but I want to see this creature for myself, Bill. 
DUGGAN: All right. Come on, I'll introduce you to Billy Boy.

[Power room]

(Rudkin enters. He sees the Cybermats rooting around the Bernalium boxes, and grabs a wrench from a shelf. The Cybermats head for him then their eyes light up. Rudkin screams and drops the wrench, clutching his wrist. Two more Cybermats appear, surrounding him. Rudkin grabs the Quick drying plastic spray and covers one Cybermat with it. Its friends zap him again and he drops the spray, both hands now useless. He screams as they move in again. Corwyn and Duggan hear him in the corridor and run to help.)

[Rest room]

(The screams are heard in the rest room. Jamie and Zoe run to the door and are stopped by the guard.) 
FLANNIGAN: You can't come out. 
JAMIE: What was that scream? 
FLANNIGAN: I don't know. It sounded as if all the devils in hell was hounding someone, but you still can't come out.

[Power room]

(Duggan and Corwyn enter to find Rudkin amongst the remains of plants and shelving.) 
DUGGAN: Is he dead? 
CORWYN: Yes. I'll tell the Controller. 
(Corwyn sees the plastic covered lump on the floor.) 
CORWYN: What's that?

[Rest room]

(The lump is on a tray and being examined by the Doctor. Jamie is prodding it with his sgian dubh.) 
ZOE: The Controller's mounted an immediate enquiry. I'm much more interested in this. 
DOCTOR: This was found by the body, was it? 
ZOE: Yes. I had to get one of the men to take a floor plate up. You just can't cut through hyperoxide. It's polymer strength is higher than chrome steel. 
DOCTOR: The Gordian knot couldn't be untied, either. 
ZOE: I don't know what that means. 
JAMIE: Oh it means that there's er 
DOCTOR: It means there's always a solution. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
DOCTOR: And the Bernalium is a write-off, is it? 
ZOE: Completely. We've got a few spares but not half enough. We'll have to get more up from Earth. 
DOCTOR: And the X-ray laser gun, the main armament of the Wheel, relies on Bernalium? 
ZOE: Do you think there's a connection? 
DOCTOR: It's a possibility, isn't it. Jamie, what do you think? 
JAMIE: Me? Well, there can be a saboteur on board. Jarvis Bennett, de did say something about a group of people. Earth For Earth, something like that. 
ZOE: Well, there are such people. They do want to stop the space programme. 
JAMIE: Aye, well, just supposing they planted a saboteur on board, waiting for the right moment. Along drifts the rocket and we're abroad. The saboteur thinks this is the right moment and strikes. 
DOCTOR: And murders? 
JAMIE: Well, if he was caught messing about with the Bernalium stuff, he may had to kill. 
DOCTOR: Well, it's an interesting theory. 
JAMIE: But it fits. 
DOCTOR: Hmm.. It doesn't fit this. 
ZOE: Which we can't cut inside. JAMIE: Och, it's just a spare part or something. The dead man tried to defend himself, used the quick set plastic, it misfired and went over this bit of machinery. 
DOCTOR: Well, we can find out. 
ZOE: How? 
DOCTOR: With the X-ray machine. 
ZOE: Of course. Why didn't I think of that? 
JAMIE: Aye, why didn't you? 
ZOE: Well, all I had to go on was the fact that hyperoxide is unbreakable. I just didn't think of X-rays. 
DOCTOR: Simple common sense works wonders sometimes, Zoe. 
ZOE: Well, at least you didn't think of X-rays. That would have been awful.

[Wheel Operations room]

(Duggan is getting a dressing-down.) 
BENNETT: You're under restriction. I'll	 have you back to Earth on the next ship that puts in. I want a written report on the whole affair, and I want it in my hands tomorrow morning, first thing. That's all. 
(Duggan moves away.) 
BENNETT: He's confined to quarters. Tanya, you'll have to take over some of Leo's operations. 
LERNOV: Very well. 
BENNETT: Now, Leo, I want that laser working as soon as possible. Get on to it at once. 
CASALI: Controller. 
BENNETT: In a minute. Now, all of you. Let's get back to normal working conditions. Gemma, I want a word with you in my quarters. All right? 
CASALI: Laleham and Vallance are ready, sir. Waiting for a go-ahead. 
BENNETT: Give it. 
CASALI: Yes, sir. Hello, travel party. You are free to embark now. We will operate air pass doors and emergency stand-bys. 
VALLANCE [OC]: Entering departure hatch for oxygen rating now. Standing by. 
CASALI: Yes, receiving you. Stand by for 
(Bennett and Corwyn leave, and we pan over to the other side of the room.) 
VOICE [OC]: This is Voyager 8 standing by, station 3. 
LERNOV: I'm sorry, Bill. 
DUGGAN: It's my own fault. I'm a fool. 
LERNOV: You didn't do anything. 
DUGGAN: I should have told somebody. I know the old man doesn't believe me but there was a creature there. 
RYAN: We did search round, Bill. Your power house is in a heck of a mess. There wasn't a sign of anything. 
DUGGAN: I didn't dream it, did I? Oh, what's the use of talking. Rudkin's dead. I'd give anything to. Oh, what's the use of talking. (Duggan leaves.) 
LERNOV: I thought you said you found some corroded metal in the Power room. 
RYAN: Yes. Gemma wanted me to keep quiet about it until she talked to Jarvis. You know, all this extra work means we won't be spending all too much spare time together. 
LERNOV: I'll find someone else to keep me company. I'd hate it if you didn't have a sense of humour.

[Corwyn's office]

BENNETT: No, no, no! There's too much unexplained. Too many irrational phenomena. What's the matter with you people? I can't turn round without somebody dreaming up some odd little thing happening, some bit of emotionally-based fantasy! 
CORWYN: Calm down, Jarvis. 
BENNETT: Did you hear that fool, Duggan. Space rodent. The man's a wreck. 
CORWYN: Jarvis, will you listen? 
BENNETT: If it's sensible, yes. 
CORWYN: I like to go through some facts. 
BENNETT: All right. All right, I'm listening. 
CORWYN: One, the rocket drifts near us. Two, drops in temperature, temporary, adjustment back to normal. Three, drops in air pressure, temporary, adjustment back to normal. Four, two meteorite storms of above average dimension, both within seven days. Five, two strangers bought to the Wheel. One of them sabotages our armaments. 
BENNETT: Don't lump all those things together. I thought that you were going to be sensible. 
CORWYN: They could be connected. 
BENNETT: Oh, for heaven's sake, Gemma, don't you start. What are you going to do, make trouble? 
CORWYN: We've got trouble, Jarvis. You're putting your head in the sand. Bill Duggan's apparitions, call them what you like, only started appearing after the rocket appeared, after the drops in air pressure. And Bernalium, the one thing vital to our defences, Bernalium is corroded just at the time when we're facing a big meteorite storm. I tell you that rocket is the basis of all our troubles. 
BENNETT: Well don't you worry about that. I've got some men to go across and look it over. But mysteries? Please, Gemma, not you as well.

[Rest room]

ZOE: The X-rays are processed now. Can you turn out the light, Jamie? 
DOCTOR: Here we go. Now, let's see what we got. (The image projected on the wall clearly shows what is inside the plastic.) 
ZOE: What's that? 
DOCTOR: It's a Cybermat! 
JAMIE: Aye. 
DOCTOR: The lights, Jamie, the lights. Cybermats. 
JAMIE: That means the Cybermen must be here too. 
DOCTOR: Yes, and there is only one place where they can be. On that rocket!

[Rocket control room]

(Tethered together, the two space walkers have reached the airlock and gone inside. They see boxes of Bernalium, then two Cybermen enter. They are zapped from the Cybermen's helmet device, and become still.) 
CYBERMAN 1: You will take us to the Wheel. 
CYBERMAN 2: Obey. Inside the Wheel, you will help us. You will obey.

Episode Four

[Rest room]

BENNETT: And what's all that supposed to mean? 
DOCTOR: The Cybermen are threatening this Space Wheel. 
BENNETT: Cybermen? Where'd you dream up a name like that. 
ZOE: The study of a system of control and communication in animals, and devices such as cybernetic machines. 
BENNETT: What are you talking about? 
ZOE: Cybernetics. 
BENNETT: I know all there is to know about Cybernetics. I don't need a lecture from you. 
DOCTOR: But Cybermen exist. You've got to believe me. You've got to! 
BENNETT: On the evidence of one faked-up X-ray shot. 
ZOE: It's not faked-up. I took it myself, Controller. 
BENNETT: Well, what are these Cybermen then? 
DOCTOR: They were once men, human beings like yourself, from the planet Mondas, but now they're more robot then man. 
BENNETT: You mean half and half? 
DOCTOR: Oh no, more than that. Their entire bodies are mechanical and their brains have been treated neuro-surgically to remove all human emotions, all sense of pain. They're ruthless, inhuman killers! 
BENNETT: You really expect me to believe that rubbish! 
DOCTOR: It's not rubbish! They'll kill anyone who stands in their path. You've got to believe me. You've just got to!

[Rocket Control room]

CYBERMAN 1: You will ferry us to the Wheel. Obey. Inside the Wheel you will help us. 
(The two Cybermen climb into a large empty crate and lie down. Laleham and Vallance fit a false floor over them then fill the space with Bernalium fuel rods.)

[Rest room]

DOCTOR: But don't you understand? The Cybermen will get inside this space Wheel. 
BENNETT: Nothing just comes in and out of this Wheel, What do you think this is, a jet heliport? 
DOCTOR: They already sent their Cybermats in to weaken you. 
JAMIE: Look, listen to him. He's telling you the truth! 
BENNETT: No, I'll tell you what he's doing. What too many people are trying to do. I don't know why, it must be space sickness. They're spreading fear, alarm, terror. You think I can't see it? 
CORWYN: He's sincere, Jarvis. At least listen 
BENNETT: How could anything get inside the Wheel, Gemma, How? How could it get through the airlock. Perhaps it'll float through the loading bay in full view of everybody. 
CORWYN: It's still worth listening and taking precautions just in case there is some truth in all this. 
BENNETT: Don't try and tell me my job, Gemma. I am still Controller of this Wheel and things will be run in my way. Any orders to the contrary can come from Earth Central. That's what. 
(Bennett stops in mid-sentence and leaves.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. How do you convince a man like that? 
CORWYN: That X-ray. I think Bill Duggan should see it. Go and find him, will you Zoe? 
ZOE: Isn't he confined to his quarters? 
CORWYN: Have him bought here, under guard if necessary, but get him. I'll be responsible. 
(Zoe leaves.) 
CORWYN: Jarvis was right about one thing, Doctor. These Cybermen of yours can't just walk into the Wheel, you know. 
DOCTOR: They will find a way. 
(Laleham and Vallance are space walking back to the Wheel trailing the crate behind them.)

[Wheel Operations room]

(Lernov is in charge of the shift and Casali is reporting to Earth.) 
CASALI: Rain belts block normal. That completes the advance weather information, Earth Central. This is Space Station W 3 signing out. 
VOICE [OC]: Thank you, W 3. Thanks for the good news. Signing out. 
CASALI: Survey party calling in. Yes, come in survey party. 
VALLANCE [OC]: Coming in to loading bay, Control. 
LERNOV: Ask why. Airlock five is all ready. 
CASALI: Is anything wrong? Airlock five is ready for you. 
VALLANCE [OC]: We found a whole crate of Bernalium on the rocket. Bringing it over with us. Approval please, Control. 
CASALI: This'll buck the old man up a bit. 
LERNOV: Yes. I'll go check. 
CASALI: Just checking with control, Armand. Await confirmation. 
BENNETT [on monitor]: Yes? 
LERNOV: Survey party report a find of Bernalium. They are bringing it over from the rocket. Can I give them the go-ahead? 
BENNETT [on monitor]: Somebody's using their brains as last. Yes, we need it badly. Good work, good work. 
LERNOV: All right, Enrico. 
CASALI: Hello, survey party. All clear on the cargo now. I'm clearing the loading bay for your arrival. 
LERNOV: Close off airlock five and clear loading bay.

[Rest room]

DUGGAN: Well, that's it, all right. 
CORWYN: What you call Billy Bug? 
DUGGAN: Yes. 
CORWYN: You're sure about this? 
DUGGAN: I'm definite. I thought I'd come across some strange space creature. 
DOCTOR: It's an alien machine. Destructive. Capable of killing. 
DUGGAN: It seemed like a space rodent. Look, I know you all think I'm crazy, but 
CORWYN: Of course not, Bill. After all, you discovered space flora out here. When you found the Cybermat you obviously thought that it was space fauna. 
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a pity you didn't tell somebody sooner. 
DUGGAN: Maybe so, Doc, but look at what happened when I did tell the old man. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZOE: I'd better take you back, Bill. I've got some new calculations to do on those meteorites. Half of the space fleet might be flying straight into them. 
(Zoe and Duggan leave.) 
DOCTOR: Meteorites. Yes. Now the Cybermats must have sent in to destroy the laser gun but 
CORWYN: They nearly did. 
DOCTOR: What? 
CORWYN: Well, I assume they did. They seem to have taken a liking to all the stock of Bernalium on board. The laser needs constant supplies of Bernalium rods. 
DOCTOR: You see, Jamie. 
JAMIE: I see right enough. If I haven't put the laser out of action, the Cybermats would have. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but why? 
JAMIE: It's obvious. Put the Wheel out of action and make it defenceless. 
DOCTOR: But the Wheel must have other defences? 
CORWYN: Magnetic field deflectors. The meson shield. They can counter-act small meteorites. 
DOCTOR: No, I think the Bernalium was destroyed for another purpose, but what? What? 
(Laleham and Vallance have entered the loading bay with the crate. The main doors close and the bay is pressurised.)

[Wheel Operations room]

ZOE: Progress readings on the star Hercules 208 in Messier 13. Radar computer reading 
JAMIE: What are you doing? 
ZOE: Bank A 208 point 16, Bank B 321 point 64. Lateral grid 
JAMIE: Are you talking to yourself? ZOE: James Robert McCrimmon, do you realise what you have done? 
JAMIE: What have I done? 
ZOE: Well, I was recording some very important readings, and now you're on my tape. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
ZOE [OC]: Progress readings on the star Hercules 208 in Messier 13. 
JAMIE: How did you do that without moving your lips? 
ZOE [OC]: Radar computer reading 
JAMIE [OC]: What are you doing? 
ZOE [OC]: Bank A 208 point 16, Bank B 321 point 64. Lateral grid 
JAMIE [OC]: Are you talking to yourself? 
JAMIE: Sorry. Have I ruined it? 
ZOE: No, not really.

[Corridor]

ZOE: Is there anything you want? 
JAMIE: No, I'm all right. 
ZOE: Well, I've got some calculations to do on those new readings. 
JAMIE: Aye, everybody's so busy. Not that they'd talk to me anyway. 
ZOE: Well, you did get off to a bad start. 
JAMIE: You mean ruining the laser. Aye, I suppose I did. Anyway, I had to do that. 
ZOE: Why? 
JAMIE: Well, er, well, I can't really tell you.

[Power room]

RYAN: Would you hold that light still, Flannigan. 
FLANNIGAN: My arm's getting tired. 
RYAN: Oh, you are a great help. 
ENGINEER: Just another few seconds, sir. 
RYAN: Would you get me that driver over there. Come on, hurry up. Right. Now, my beauty. 
(Bennett enters.) 
BENNETT: How's it going? 
RYAN: Oh, hello, sir. All right, Penny. Well, the boys could do with a break. They've worked non-stop. 
BENNETT: I'm giving you Bill Duggan, No reason why he can't make himself useful. You others take a break. Keep up the good work. 
RYAN: Right sir. 
BENNETT: Yes. 
(Bennett leaves, Duggan enters.) 
RYAN: Oh boy, am I glad to see you, Bill. 
DUGGAN: How's it look? 
RYAN: Oh, we just had a bit of luck. The central deployment complex didn't get any plastic. 
DUGGAN: Oh, that's great. What about the Bernalium? 
RYAN: Oh, I haven't got around to that yet. Go on, you two, hop it. 
FLANNIGAN: Well, if it's all the same with you, sir, we'll just grab a snack and be back in five minutes. 
RYAN: You'll take forty five minutes and like it. 
FLANNIGAN: Right. 
(The engineers leave.) 
DUGGAN: What about you? You look done in. 
RYAN: Oh, I can't leave you on your own. It needs at least two to handle this thing. 
CHANG: Some people have all the luck. The Controller said you needed some help. Of course, I have only done two watches in a row. 
RYAN: Congratulations. I've done three. 
DUGGAN: Oh, go and shove off, Leo. Chang and I can handle this. 
RYAN: Well, I 
DUGGAN: Come on, I know how to get to the Bernalium, don't I?

[Rest room]

CORWYN: It's an extraordinary X-ray. 
(The Doctor's skull, not the Cybermat.) 
DOCTOR: Extraordinary? Extraordinary? 
CORWYN: I dare say your head'll ache for a quite a while yet but at least there's no damage. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm so glad there is no damage. Miss Corwyn. 
CORWYN: Mrs. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, forgive me. 
CORWYN: My husband died in the asteroid belt three years ago. 
DOCTOR: Oh. I'm so sorry. 
CORWYN: My name's Gemma. 
DOCTOR: Gemma. How nice. Gemma, tell me. Tell me about the Controller, Jarvis. 
CORWYN: Tell you what? 
DOCTOR: He's a strange man to be in a position like this. 
CORWYN: In ordinary circumstances. no. 
DOCTOR: Are there any ordinary circumstances in space? 
CORWYN: Jarvis is simply a man who can't accept phenomena outside the laws of physics. 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a very accurate 
CORWYN: Were you going to say diagnosis? 
DOCTOR: You're very perceptive. 
CORWYN: You see in this failing of his a medical weakness. 
DOCTOR: Don't you? 
CORWYN: Normally he's more than capable of commanding this station. It's a continuous and merciless responsibility. 
DOCTOR: Exactly. One does wonder what a man like that will do when faced with a problem for which he has no solution. 
CORWYN: I must confess I've been concerned. Jarvis shows signs of blocking off his mind. He just can't face the truth.

[Wheel Operations room]

BENNETT: Everything in order here? 
LERNOV: Well 
BENNETT: Yes, yes. I can see it is. Good, good.

[Rest room]

CORWYN: But you need rest. You really shouldn't get up yet. 
DOCTOR: Of course I have to get up. 
CORWYN: Can you persuade him to rest? 
JAMIE: Oh, it's no good trying to stop him. 
CORWYN: But it's much too soon. 
DOCTOR: Now, Gemma, be reasonable. I know the dangers. The Cybermen need to colonise. They must have the treasures of Earth. 
CORWYN: You can't leave this room. Jarvis has given orders. 
DOCTOR: He's not in control of himself. 
CORWYN: I'm sorry, Doctor. I can't countermand any orders the Controller's issued. 
JAMIE: He's as stubborn as you are.

[Corridor]

BENNETT: (to guard) Everything in order here? Good. Good.

[Rest room]

BENNETT: Up and about again, eh? That's better. I've done the tour, Gemma. Everything's running like clockwork. 
CORWYN: Fine. I'd like to talk to you about the rocket. 
BENNETT: Yes, everything's going very well. Very well indeed. You must want to stretch your legs. Get someone to take you round. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, thank you. You will tell the guard, won't you? 
BENNETT: (to guard) Off you go. Everything's in order here. 
CORWYN: Jarvis. 
BENNETT: You might want to make a note about morale, Gemma. It's excellent. Never been better. 
CORWYN: But 
BENNETT: Yes, there's nothing we can't handle. Nothing. Tired now. Turn in, I suppose, and get some sleep. Yes, that's good. I'll need you first watch. Yes, keep up the good work. Keep up the good work.

[Power room]

(Duggan is inspecting some of the remaining Bernalium rods.) 
DUGGAN: These are no good anyway. They're covered in plastic. 
CHANG: Laleham and Vallance bought back a load of Bernalium from the rocket. 
DUGGAN: Well, just don't stand there, go and grab a dozen sticks. With a bit of luck, we can replace these and reassemble in a couple of hours. Well, go on, chop-chop. 
CHANG: I'm on my way.

[Loading bay]

(Change goes down the steps to the empty bay. The crate has been unpacked and the boxes of Bernalium are next to it. Chang picks one up and is about to leave when he notices that the crate is not as it should be. He lifts a board from the false bottom and looks inside, but it is empty. A metallic hand grabs his shoulder. Chang twists away and throws the Bernalium at the Cyberman, making it stagger. The second Cyberman appears with Laleham and Vallance.) 
CHANG: Help me! 
(Chang runs for the steps, but the Cybermen zap him with energy from their chest units. Laleham and Vallance each pick up a box of Bernalium and leave as the Cybermen dispose of Chang.)

[Wheel Operations room]

(An instrument panel comes to life.) 
LERNOV: Enrico? 
LERNOV: Oh, hello, Leo. 
CASALI: Hello, Chief. 
LERNOV: Have you had notice of anybody using the waste incinerator in the loading bay? 
CASALI: No, I don't think so. I'll check. 
RYAN: What's the problem? 
LERNOV: Somebody just used the incinerator in the loading bay, that's all. 
CASALI: No, no, there's nothing here. 
RYAN: You'd better put it in the log, Tanya. Somebody's for the high jump.

[Power room]

(Laleham and Vallance enter with their boxes.) 
DUGGAN: Hello, boys. Hey, good on you. Where's Chang? 
LALEHAM: Cut his hand. He's gone to the Medical bay. 
DUGGAN: Trust him. 
VALLANCE: Anything to be done? 
DUGGAN: Yeah, you can open up a box of rods. Got this job licked. I just hope the rods are the right dimensions, that's all. 
LALEHAM: They are. 
DUGGAN: Since when have you been a expert? 
VALLANCE: The lasers have to be made operative or the meteorites will destroy the Wheel. 
DUGGAN: No. Well why do you think I'm sweating my back off here? Here, what's up with him? 
LALEHAM: They're the right ones. 
DUGGAN: Yes, so they are. You must be psychic. But don't tell the old man. He doesn't believe in extra sensory perception. 
(Duggan puts a rod into the capacitator.) 
DUGGAN: Hey, this is perfect. Marvellous! 
VALLANCE: When will the repair be finished? 
DUGGAN: It won't be done at all if you keep nattering. 
VALLANCE: The meteorites must not harm the Wheel. 
DUGGAN: That storm really worries you, doesn't it? Well, don't let it, don't let it. It'll be a close call but I reckon to have this laser ready and in operation in six to seven hours. So you can sleep in your beds like babies, the pair of you. Daddy won't let anything happen to you. 
(Behind Duggan's back, Vallance opens the door and lets a Cyberman in.) 
DUGGAN: Now, if you really want to make yourself useful. 
(Duggan turns and sees the Cyberman, which uses its hypnosis beam on him.) 
CYBERMAN 1: The Wheel must be protected from the meteorites. We will assemble your laser defence rays. You will go to Central Control. 
DUGGAN: Central Control. 
LALEHAM: The Operations Room. 
CYBERMAN 1: These are your orders.

[Rest room]

(Doctor Corwyn is reading Bennett's medical file when Zoe enters.) 
CORWYN: Oh, Zoe, it's you. What do you want? 
ZOE: Well, it's rather difficult to explain. 
CORWYN: What is it? 
ZOE: Well, I've done a report. Some calculations I've been doing. I was ordered to forget them. 
CORWYN: Ordered? By whom? What report? 
ZOE: My calculations on the orbital path of the meteorite storm. I found a new element which indicated a critical state and I reported my findings to the Controller. 
CORWYN: And he ignored them. 
ZOE: Yes. Well, you don't sound very surprised. 
CORWYN: No. 
ZOE: Well, he said it was all perfectly normal, but it isn't. 
CORWYN: He's getting worse. 
ZOE: Is he ill? 
CORWYN: I don't know yet. 
ZOE: Well, if he is he's chosen a rather inconvenient time, hasn't he? 
CORWYN: Do you ever feel anything emotional, Zoe? 
ZOE: Emotional? Do you know, that's the second time I've been asked that in the last few hours. Leo Ryan said that I was all brains and no heart. 
CORWYN: Yes, it's your training. I shouldn't worry about it. 
ZOE: Oh, but I do. I don't want to be thought of as a freak. Leo said I was like a robot, a machine. I think he's right. My head's been pumped full of facts and figures which I reel out automatically when needed, but, well, I want to feel things as well. 
CORWYN: Good. Unfortunately the parapsychology unit at the City tends to ignore this aspect in its pupils. Some of them never fully develop their human emotions. 
ZOE: You don't think I'll be like that, do you? 
CORWYN: No. No, you seemed to have survived their brain-washing techniques remarkably well. 
ZOE: Oh, good. 
CORWYN: Now, about these calculations of yours.

[Wheel Operations room]

(The Doctor is getting a tour.) 
LERNOV: And this last one is how we check everything. 
DOCTOR: I see. 
RYAN: Yes, anything that uses energy on the Wheel, however small, is registered on this wall. From a coffee-grinder upwards 
DOCTOR: Do you have any coffee? 
RYAN: Would you like some? 
DOCTOR: I'd love some, I really would. 
LERNOV: I have a coffee pellet. Would you like one? 
DOCTOR: That's better than nothing. 
(Zoe enters and catches their attention.) 
RYAN: Excuse me, Doctor. Tanya. 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, of course. 
JAMIE: Doctor, don't forget we need that mercury stuff for the Tardis. 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie, I haven't forgotten. I'm worried about the Tardis. If I'm right and those Cybermen are. What's going on? 
(There's an intense conversation happening.) 
JAMIE: Let's find out. 
DOCTOR: What's going on, Zoe? 
ZOE: I've done some new calculations on the orbital path of the meteorite storm. They're heading toward us faster than we thought. 
JAMIE: Don't you have any cheerful news? 
ZOE: Facts are facts, and these are indisputable. 
DOCTOR: I wouldn't dream of contradicting you. Can you repair the laser gun in time? 
ZOE: Well, that's not the worry, it's the Controller. I went to him with the new data on the meteorites and he just brushed the whole thing aside. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear, he's getting worse. 
ZOE: That what Doctor Corwyn says. He is ill, isn't he? 
DOCTOR: Why aren't you worried about the laser gun? I thought all of the Bernalium has been destroyed. 
ZOE: Oh no, some more turned up. 
DOCTOR: Oh good. 
ZOE: Yes, two of the men bought a crate of it over from the rocket. 
DOCTOR: Ah. What? What did you say? 
ZOE: Well, that's what Flannigan said. I met him when he was going off duty. 
DOCTOR: Gemma! Gemma, did you know about this Bernalium from the rocket? 
CORWYN: Yes, Tanya told me. 
DOCTOR: Don't you see what it means? The Cybermen are here. They came over in that crate. 
CORWYN: But how could our two men have bought them over? 
DOCTOR: But they didn't know what they were doing. They were just obeying orders. 
CORWYN: The Cybermen hypnotised them? 
DOCTOR: Yes, something like that. 
CORWYN: We're not exactly children, Doctor. All spacemen are protected against brain-control by drugs. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but a psychotropic drug is only effective against a known enemy. Have you induced repulsion in all parts of the brain yet? 
CORWYN: No, but then there's the implanted Silenski capsules. It gives off a signal when there is an adverse influence against the wearer. 
DOCTOR: How can we check? 
CORWYN: Tanya, I want to check the Silenski circuit. 
LERNOV: But I shall have to activate the whole defence network. 
CORWYN: I'll authorise the extra power. 
LERNOV: Watch the lines. If they're steady then everything is normal. 
DOCTOR: I see. 
LERNOV: Try this room first. 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, please. Is that all right? 
(Jamie and Zoe see Duggan.) 
JAMIE: What's he hanging around for? I thought that he was under guard or something. 
ZOE: So did I. Bill, has the Controller 
(Duggan ignores Zoe and goes past.) 
LERNOV: Here, Wait a minute. Look. 
CORWYN: Someone is affected, Doctor. You were right. 
LERNOV: Someone in this room. 
DOCTOR: Er, can we pin it down to an individual? 
LERNOV: I'll quarter the room off. Over there, in the direction of 
DOCTOR: No, stop him! 
(Duggan smashes the communications desk with a heavy spanner. It goes bang, killing Duggan.) 
DOCTOR: He's dead. Now, now listen, listen everyone. The Cybermen are here, in this Wheel. They took over this poor fellow to stop you sending for help or signalling to Earth. Now just a minute. Gemma, you must alert the whole Wheel and you'll need something stronger than drugs to stop your people from being taken over. It doesn't matter how crude it is. A metal plate and a transistor will do. Tape them to the back of the neck. It will absorb the Cyber control signals. 
RYAN: I can do that. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Good. 
LERNOV: I'll help you. 
DOCTOR: Right. 
JAMIE: What do we do? 
DOCTOR: We're going hunting, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Are you sure you know who's going to be hunted. 
DOCTOR: A very good question. Come on. 
(The Doctor and Jamie leave.) 
ZOE: Can I do something? 
LERNOV: No. 
ZOE: Isn't there anything I can do. 
LERNOV: Well, all right.

[Loading bay]

(The Doctor and Jamie carefully descend the steps. The crate and Bernalium boxes are still there.) 
JAMIE: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: What is it? 
JAMIE: There it is. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, I know. Now, shush. 
(The Doctor examines the crate and finds the false bottom.) 
JAMIE: Is this it here? 
DOCTOR: Yes, this is it. 
JAMIE: How could they get in here? 
DOCTOR: It's a false bottom, you see. 
(They start to search the rest of the bay then hear metal on metal. A Cyberman is coming down the steps.)

Episode Five

[Loading bay]

(The Doctor and Jamie hide behind the crate and watch the Cyberman take one of the boxes of Bernalium then leave.) 
JAMIE: That was close. 
DOCTOR: It's so easy. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: I don't understand them. 
JAMIE: What are you talking about? 
DOCTOR: Destroying the wheel, Jamie, that's what I'm talking about. From the outside it's strong enough, but now that the Cybermen are inside, I 
JAMIE: Yes, I see what you mean. What do you think they are planning? 
DOCTOR: Well, they obviously don't want to destroy the Wheel. 
JAMIE: What do they want, then? 
DOCTOR: I wish I knew. The first thing we must do is to protect the people here. 
JAMIE: How? 
DOCTOR: What's the thing which we need to survive which the Cybermen don't? 
JAMIE: Food. 
DOCTOR: Always thinking of your stomach, aren't you. No. Air, Jamie, air. Now, I wonder how this works. 
(The Doctor hits a video comm. button.)

[Wheel Operations room]

LERNOV: It's the Doctor. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Hello. I think that it would be wise to lock all the air-lock doors. Can you do that? 
RYAN: Yes. 
LERNOV: Leo says that he can. Why? 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: The Cybermen are definitely on the Wheel. Jamie and I have just seen one. They may try to interfere with the air supply. 
JAMIE [on monitor]: Doctor. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: What? Keep this channel open. 
JAMIE [on monitor]: Something moved over there. Just caught the corner of my eye. 
CORWYN: What's wrong? 
LERNOV: I don't know. 
RYAN: Shall I seal off the airlocks, Gem? 
CORWYN: Yes. 
RYAN: Sealing off all the airlocks. 
LERNOV: I suppose that we can trust the Doctor? 
CORWYN: I'm not sure why I do, but I do. Sealing off the airlocks is good common sense anyway.

[Loading bay]

JAMIE: There. 
(It's a Cybermat. The Doctor speaks into the video comm.) 
DOCTOR: Listen to me very carefully. Do as I ask and don't delay. One of the Cybermats is very close to us. It'll tune into our brain waves at any minute. 
JAMIE: Doctor, it's turning! 
DOCTOR: Hook up a variable audio-frequency on this channel right away. Do it at once!

[Wheel Operations room]

CORWYN: Enrico, leave that.

[Loading bay]

JAMIE: There's a second one. Come on. 
DOCTOR: No. We don't stand a chance. They've got a range of at least ten feet.

[Wheel Operations room]

DOCTOR [on monitor]: Hurry. Please hurry. 
CORWYN: Come on, Enrico. 
CASALI: All right, all right! That's it. Power! More! Come on, come on! 
(The sound whine travels through the comm. circuits and builds in the loading bay. The Doctor and Jamie cover their ears and the Cybermats start veering around out of control, bumping into each other. One starts to go in tight circles until it smokes and stops while the other rushes head first into a wall to expire in a flash.)

[Wheel Operations room]

CORWYN: That's enough, Enrico.

[Loading bay]

DOCTOR: We're coming back as fast as we can. This is what you've saved us from.

[Wheel Operations room]

LERNOV: What that's thing? 
ZOE: It's a Cybermat. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Exactly. 
(Meanwhile, in the Power room, a Cyberman uses a portable communicator to contact the Mother ship and the Cyber-Planner.) 
LERNOV: Leo. There's an energy reading from the power house. 
RYAN: It's not coming off our power source, that's for sure. Let's check it out.

[Power room]

CYBERMAN: All Cybermats have been destroyed. 
PLANNER [on monitor]: Destroyed? By what method. 
CYBERMAN: They have used high-current phase contrast. 
PLANNER [on monitor]: One human has knowledge beyond our predictions. Report. 
CYBERMAN: The X-ray laser machine is repaired. 
PLANNER [on monitor]: And operative? 
CYBERMAN: Yes. In stage of operation. 
PLANNER [on monitor]: Communication beam to Earth? 
CYBERMAN: Attacked and damaged. 
PLANNER [on monitor]: Phase six. 
CYBERMAN: Yes. 
PLANNER [on monitor]: The space station is to be taken over. Complete Phase six.

[Wheel Operations room]

RYAN: Workshop. Workshop, will you come in please? 
CASALI: Well, Bill Duggan knew the right spot okay. 
LERNOV: What about radar? 
CASALI: Radar's fine but the radio's kaput. 
LERNOV: When's the next check to Earth Central? 
CASALI: Oh three hundred. Two hours time. 
LERNOV: Set up a check on the first wave of the meteorites. 
CASALI: I don't see the point. We haven't got a laser to knock them out with. 
LERNOV: Don't be pessimistic, Enrico. They may not have a direct course onto us. Anything can happen. 
CASALI: Everything is. 
RYAN: Blimey, you'd think we are alone on the Wheel. I can't raise anybody. 
LERNOV: Have you told Gemma? 
RYAN: She's got her hands full enough as it is. 
CORWYN: Jarvis? Jarvis, look at the creature. Show it to him, Zoe. 
(Zoe holds up an inanimate Cybermat.) 
BENNETT: No. No, it's not true. It's not true. 
CORWYN: All right, Zoe, put it away somewhere. Complete withdrawal. Loss of effect. 
DOCTOR: Not necessary complete. Catatonic features certainly. 
CORWYN: I can try ECT. He could be shocked back to normal. 
DOCTOR: Is the equipment here? 
CORWYN: No, it's in the Medical bay. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn't advise moving him. You've thrown a magnetic forcefield round this section? 
CORWYN: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Enough to keep the Cybermen out? 
CORWYN: Enough to keep anything out. The crew have been warned. Oh. 
DOCTOR: No, it's no good. You're second in command. You must take over. 
CORWYN: Take over what? We're invaded. We have no contact with Earth, we're in the path of meteorites. Take over what? How do we fight without the laser? 
(On the other side of the room.) 
JAMIE: How is he? 
ZOE: Hopeless. 
JAMIE: Well, that's just fine. 
ZOE: He's just closed himself away. 
JAMIE: Well, who's the second in command? 
ZOE: Doctor Corwyn. 
JAMIE: At least she's all right. 
ZOE: Yes, although what she can do, I don't know. 
JAMIE: Oh, there is something you don't know, then. 
ZOE: There's too much I don't know. I was trained to believe logic and calculation would provide me with all the answers. Well, I'm just beginning to realise there are questions which I can't answer. 
JAMIE: You're just not trained for an emergency like this. 
ZOE: Well, that's the whole point. What good am I? I've been created for some false kind of existence where only known kinds of emergencies are catered for. Well, what good is that to me now? 
JAMIE: Hey, we're not done yet, you know. 
ZOE: And if we survive? What then, Jamie? Suppose we do get ourselves out of this mess. What have I got left? A blind reliance on facts and logic. 
RYAN: Section Twelve. Section Twelve. Will you please come in? 
(In section twelve, Oxygen Supply, a crewmember is about to answer the call when a Cyberman grabs him from behind.) 
RYAN: Calling Power house. Power house, will you please come in?

[Power room]

(As Flannigan enters, Laleham and Vallance come out of the shadows.) 
FLANNIGAN: Oh, it's yourself. Why don't you answer this thing. Somebody sounds a bit violent. 
VALLANCE: It's not important. 
FLANNIGAN: Ah, it could be the old man himself, you know. Well, is this laser working yet, is it? 
LALEHAM: It's finished. 
FLANNIGAN: Ah, so we're not to be riddled with the meteorites then? 
VALLANCE: No. 
FLANNIGAN: Well, that's great. I've a whole years leave coming to me back on Earth. Now come on. 
LALEHAM: Don't touch that. 
FLANNIGAN: You just can't ignore it. What is it? What's the matter with you two, hey? 
VALLANCE: Just do as you're told. 
FLANNIGAN: Hey now, have you both gone mad or what? 
(Vallance points a gun at Flannigan.) 
FLANNIGAN: Don't point that thing at me, laddie. 
(Flannigan knocks the gun from Vallance's hand and floors him. Laleham brandishes a crowbar.) 
FLANNIGAN: All right. If it's a fight you're after, I'm your man. Come on. 
(Laleham swings the crowbar and misses.) 
FLANNIGAN: You need a few lessons in the noble and manly arts, me bucko! All right, come on! 
(Laleham and Flannigan fight, and Vallance picks up his weapon. Vallance fires, missing Flannigan and killing Laleham instead. A Cyberman enters and hypnotises Flannigan.) 
CYBERMAN: The Earth machine has been installed? 
VALLANCE: Yes. 
CYBERMAN: A force field has been set around the Operations Control room. How is it operated? 
VALLANCE: Only from within the Operations Room. 
CYBERMAN: Dispose of the body of the human.

ZOE: Come on, some more. Just a little more. 
BENNETT: No, no more. 
LERNOV: Don't force him. Give him whatever he wants. 
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not surprised you can't get in touch with the rest of the Wheel. 
JAMIE: Aye, the Cybermen aren't going to sit around and do nothing. 
CORWYN: But can they still control our people? I thought you'd 
DOCTOR: With the metal plates, you mean. Has everybody had them fitted to the back of their necks? 
CORWYN: No, not yet. There are still some crew members without. 
DOCTOR: Well, it would be advisable to have it done. 
RYAN: Coming through now. 
CASALI: I lost them for a moment there. 
(Everyone goes over to the radar screen.) 
CASALI: Hey, will you listen to that? Now this is a big storm, bigger than we thought. 
RYAN: All right, all right, don't make it worse. 
CORWYN: We'll have to rely on the anti-matter field projectors. 
CASALI: Hey, you don't think the meteorites are going to bounce off them, do you? We're talking about things weighing two or three hundred tons here. 
CORWYN: How far away are they? 
CASALI: See for yourself. Less than a million miles now. Closing on an elliptical path tilted ten degrees. 
(The video comm. beeps.) 
RYAN: Well, thank goodness for that. Must be one of the other sections. 
FLANNIGAN [on monitor]: Power room. 
RYAN: Flannigan, where've you been? 
FLANNIGAN [on monitor]: Restoring the laser discharge piece. 
RYAN: What was that? 
FLANNIGAN [on monitor]: It has been completed. 
RYAN: The laser's repaired? 
FLANNIGAN [on monitor]: It is ready for testing now. 
RYAN: Great. The laser's working. Stand by to run a test. Flannigan, where have you been? I've been trying to raise you for ages. 
FLANNIGAN [on monitor]: There must be a fault on the line. Vallance is here with me. We are ready when you are ready. 
RYAN: Right. 
(A hatch opens on the outer surface of the Wheel, and a laser cannon comes out.) 
CASALI: We're cutting it too fine. They're coming at us too fast. Seven hundred thousand now. Six ninety, six eighty. The speed of them, it's fantastic. 
RYAN: Take position from radar calibration estimates. 
CASALI: Angle ninety on zero four zero two. Distance now six ten thousand, six dead, five ninety. 
JAMIE: What's the range of your machine? 
CORWYN: Fifty thousand miles total destruction, ninety thousand partial. 
DOCTOR: Well, it would be as well not to miss then, wouldn't it. 
RYAN: We'll try a random shot. At least we'll see how the power bank reacts. Stand by to test laser. Blue button. Red on stand by. 
CASALI: Angle eighty eight on zero four zero one now. Distance closing. Five hundred thousand dead. Four ninety, four eighty. 
RYAN: Tanya, take a power reading on this. And fire! 
LERNOV: Power maximum and normal. 
RYAN: Well, everybody? I think we stand a chance. 
(The meteorites continue on course.) 
CASALI: Angle eighty eight on zero four zero one and holding. Distance closing. Three fifty thousand, three forty, three thirty. Angle change. Eighty seven on zero four zero point nine nine recurring. Distance two eighty thousand, two seventy, two sixty. 
(The laser is fine tuned while the Doctor, Jamie and Corwyn watch.) 
RYAN: Stand by for further tests on lasers. 
LERNOV: Power max one hundred. All systems green and steady. 
RYAN: Red on stand by. Fire. 
LERNOV: Power maximum and normal. All systems operating. 
RYAN: Stand by for test blanket fire. Red on stand by. 
LERNOV: Power max one thousand. All systems green and steady. 
RYAN: And fire. 
LERNOV: Power maximum and normal. All systems operative. 
RYAN: Well, let'em all come. We're ready for them. 
DOCTOR: I think it is reasonable to assume that the Cybermen caused that star to go nova. 
CORWYN: Deliberately causing the meteorites to deflect from their orbit to destroy the Wheel, you mean? 
DOCTOR: No. Not to destroy the Wheel. To make you want to use the laser. Then they sent in their Cybermats to attack the laser and destroy the Bernalium. 
JAMIE: And then you'd search that drifting rocket and find a big crate. 
DOCTOR: With the Cybermen inside it. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
DOCTOR: It was only way they could get into the Wheel. 
CORWYN: And now you think they've repaired the laser. 
JAMIE: They must have done, otherwise they'd be smashing up the Wheel, wouldn't they? 
DOCTOR: So you see this isn't just an attack by an alien race on a space station. The Cybermen have another purpose. 
CORWYN: What? 
DOCTOR: They have an over-riding ambition to invade the Earth, plunder its mineral wealth, and somehow they see a way of doing it through this Wheel. 
CORWYN: But how can we stop them? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. 
CORWYN: Presumably these Cybermen disposed of the crewmembers of the rocket in space? 
DOCTOR: Hmm? Yes. Jamie, the Time Vector Generator from the Tardis. Where is it? 
JAMIE: Oh you mean the gold rod thing? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, where is it? 
JAMIE: You've got it. I put it your pocket in the rocket. 
DOCTOR: Are you sure? 
JAMIE: Yes? 
DOCTOR: But I haven't got it. 
JAMIE: You must have. Not unless it's fallen out when they were moving you. Is it important? 
DOCTOR: Important? Someone'll have to go over to the rocket to get it. 
JAMIE: Good luck to them. Who's going? 
DOCTOR: Well, if Gemma can spare someone to show you how to make the journey. 
JAMIE: Me? 
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. You're the only one who knows what it looks like besides me, and I'm much too busy. Besides, it's your fault that it's lost. 
JAMIE: Mine? 
DOCTOR: Well, isn't it? 
JAMIE: Well, yes. No! Doctor Corwyn. Oh Doctor. Och.

[Power room]

PLANNER [on monitor]: The meteorite shower is approaching the Wheel. 
CYBERMAN: The weapons of the Earth humans have been tested and are operating. 
PLANNER [on monitor]: Phase six can be completed. 
CYBERMAN: The Earth humans have set up a neutron field barrier on the perimeter of the section containing their room of Operations. 
PLANNER [on monitor]: Do not complete Phase Six. Initiate Plan Three. 
CYBERMAN: Follow me. 
(Vallance and the Cyberman leave.)

[Corridor]

CORWYN: Replace the field barrier now. We're through. 
ZOE: I'll see of it's clear ahead. 
JAMIE: I still don't see why you should send a wee thing like that with me. 
CORWYN: She is the only one I can spare who knows enough about space drill to get you across to that rocket safely. 
JAMIE: Maybe so. I still think I'm better by myself. 
CORWYN: Do you? I wouldn't be too sure if I were you.

[Wheel Operations room]

RYAN: Have you gone off your head? 
DOCTOR: She, she agreed to go. 
RYAN: She'd no right to agree. And you've got no right to let her. 
DOCTOR: I had to. Jamie will look after her. 
RYAN: Have you any idea of the dangers they'll face between the Wheel and the rocket? And you've send Zoe and your friend out into an area which is bound to be bombarded with small debris, quite apart from the radiation and the thermal shock. 
DOCTOR: Well, they knew the risk. Zoe calculated it. 
RYAN: Oh, yes, Zoe calculated it. And what about Gemma, hey? What if Gemma meets up with one of those Cyberman things? 
CASALI: Coming in to range now. 
RYAN: All right. Now you don't do anything unless I say so. Clear? Tanya, take a power reading on this. Rico, calculate distance and direction. All systems on stand by.

[Oxygen supply room]

(Corwyn, Zoe and Jamie find a crewman.) 
JAMIE: He's dead. 
CORWYN: Yes, I'm afraid so. Zoe, the emergency exit. You'll find space equipment in the airlock. 
ZOE: Come on, Jamie. 
JAMIE: All right. You'd better take that. 
(He hands Corwyn the dead man's blaster and goes to the airlock.) 
CORWYN: Good luck. 
JAMIE: Thank you. 
(Corwyn closes the airlock then goes to the video comm.)

[Wheel Operations room]

DOCTOR: Yes? 
CORWYN [on monitor]: We're through. No problems. 
DOCTOR: Good. 
CASALI: Main concentration coming into range. 
RYAN: Crossover on vector link. Countdown is from now. 
CASALI: Well, this is the big stuff. Angle ninety on zero three. Distance, one hundred thousand miles.

[Oxygen supply room]

(Corwyn hides behind a bank of machinery as Vallance enters carrying a small box. A Cyberman follows him.) 
CYBERMAN: This controls the oxygen on the Space Station. 
VALLANCE: Yes. 
CYBERMAN: Open it. 
(The box contains some silver capsules.) 
CYBERMAN: Each section of the Wheel has a separate air supply. 
VALLANCE: (Yes. 
CYBERMAN: Insert one capsule into each section. The oxygen will turn into pure ozone. The humans will die.

[Wheel Operations room]

RYAN: Fire! Fire! And fire! 
CASALI: Oh, it's hopeless. There's too many of them. 
RYAN: Shut up, Rico. Fire! 
CASALI: Angle change. Ten degrees. 
DOCTOR: Yes? 
CORWYN [on monitor]: Doctor, listen carefully. They're going to

[Oxygen supply room]

CORWYN: Poison the air supply. Do you understand? poison the air supply? 
(The Doctor sees movement behind Corwyn.) 
CORWYN: Tell Leo Ryan to switch over to the sectional supply unit.

[Wheel Operations room]

DOCTOR: Gemma, run! Get away from there! Run! 
(Corwyn fires her blaster. The Cyberman is slowed for a moment and Corwyn runs for the door but she is zapped and killed before she can open it.) 
DOCTOR: Gemma, can you hear me? Gemma! Gemma! 
CASALI: Angle of deviation ten degrees. 
RYAN: And fire! 
DOCTOR: Gemma!

[Space]

(Jamie and Zoe watch the exploding meteorites.) JAMIE: Zoe, look! 
ZOE: The meteorites, they're heading straight for us!

Episode Six

(From the Lost in Time DVD)

[Wheel Operations room]

RYAN: Fire! 
(Several meteorites explode. Jamie and Zoe grab each others hand to try and stay together in the shock waves.) 
CASALI: We're hitting them! 
DOCTOR: What about Jamie and Zoe? 
LERNOV: Leo, the shock radiation and blast 
RYAN: Fire! 
LERNOV: But you must think about the two children. 
RYAN: I can't think about anything except those meteorites. Fire! 
LERNOV: But Zoe and the boy will be 
RYAN: I can't help that. They'll have to take their chances. Range, Rico? 
CASALI: One eighty, one ninety. 
RYAN: Right, new sequence. Red on standby. Fire! 
LERNOV: They'll be blown out of space. 
DOCTOR: Zoe calculated the risk. Let's hope she was right. 
RYAN: Fire! (More meteorites go Boom! and this time Jamie and Zoe can't hang onto each other in the shockwaves. They drift apart.) 
CASALI: The screen's clear, sir. We've done it. Main body deflected. 
DOCTOR: Any signs of Jamie and Zoe? 
CASALI: No, I won't be able to pick them up on the video screen until the static has cleared. 
RYAN: Well, keep it on blue stand by for now. There's bound to be a cloud of smaller stuff following on behind. 
CASALI: Yeah, okay. 
RYAN: And do a check on all circuits. Maintain all power levels till further notice. 
CASALI: No, I can't find them. 
RYAN: Watch out for smaller meteorites, Rico. Now then, you know what you've done, don't you? Those two kids out there have probably either been burnt up by radiation or fried by thermal blast. Always assuming, of course, they weren't actually hit by any of that rubbish. 
DOCTOR: Do you think I don't know that? It was a calculated risk that had to be taken. 
RYAN: Why? 
DOCTOR: Because there's something on board that rocket that we've got to have if we're going to beat the Cybermen. 
RYAN: And that justified risking two lives? 
DOCTOR: Yes, to save many. But anyway, we're all going to get killed shortly unless you switch over to sectional air supply. 
RYAN: What are you talking about? 
DOCTOR: The Cybermen are going to poison the air. 
RYAN: How do you know? 
DOCTOR: Gemma told me. 
RYAN: Where is she? 
DOCTOR: She's in the Oxygen room. 
RYAN: Right, well, I'll talk to her. 
DOCTOR: No, no. Well, you can't. She's dead. 
(Ryan switches on the wall monitor and sees Corwyn's body lying on the floor.) 
DOCTOR: She sacrificed her life to warn us. 
CASALI: Here comes another swarm. Meteor bearing forty five, thirty six. 
RYAN: Right. 
LERNOV: Any sign of Zoe and the boy? 
CASALI: No. 
RYAN: All systems on stand by. We'll try three second interval shots. Stand by to reinforce the anti-matter field around the Wheel. Maybe we can turn them off course. 
CASALI: Coming into range. 
RYAN: Right. Tanya, watch the power levels. 
RYAN: The Bernalium rods must be nearly burned out by now. 
CASALI: In range now. Bearing one eighty one ninety as before. 
RYAN: Red on stand by. Fire! Fire! 
LERNOV: Power's dropping, Leo. 
RYAN: Switch over to anti-matter field projectors! 
CASALI: They're turning. We've deflected them! 
DOCTOR: Well, thank heavens. Hello, where's Jarvis? (Bennett is striding along a corridor. Lernov switches the wall monitor to different views searching for him.) 
RYAN: There he is. Jarvis! Jarvis, what are you doing? Jarvis, what are you doing? Come back. 
BENNETT [on monitor]: No, I'm going on. They've killed Gemma, you know. 
LERNOV: Please come back. 
BENNETT [on monitor: I lifted the force field. You'd better replace it. 
LERNOV: Leo, where are you going? 
RYAN: To bring him back. 
DOCTOR: No, wait. You're too late. Look! 
(Bennett turns to see the Cyberman walking up behind him.) 
RYAN: Jarvis, watch out! 
(Bennett walks towards the Cyberman, ready to grapple with it, but is easily overpowered. The control room watches in horror as the Cyberman lifts Bennett up over its head and throws him down the corridor. Then it zaps him with the chest unit ray.) 
LERNOV: Turn it off. Turn it off!

[Rocket control room]

(Jamie brings Zoe a drink with a straw.) 
JAMIE: Here. 
ZOE: Oh, thanks, Jamie. 
JAMIE: How do you feel now? 
ZOE: I didn't think we'd get through. I feel as if someone's been hitting me all over with small hammers. 
JAMIE: Aye. Just you take it easy. 
ZOE: Oh, it's all right. I'll help. What's this thing like we're looking for? 
JAMIE: It's about that long, gold, with a gold tip on one end and a white one on the other. Now, you're sure you're all right? Come on, then.

[Oxygen supply room]

(Large lava lamps are above the control panels.) 
CYBERMAN: The meteorites have been destroyed. Now we will take over. You have inserted the capsule in the air supply? 
VALLANCE: Yes. 
CYBERMAN: Inject it into the system. Effective penetration should be immediate. Report. 
VALLANCE: Negative. They must have switched over to the emergency supply. 
CYBERMAN: That cannot be reached? 
VALLANCE: No. It is inside the force field. 
(The Cyberman switches on his portable communicator.) 
PLANNER [on monitor]: Do you report success? 
CYBERMAN: No. Our plans are anticipated. 
PLANNER [on monitor]: Wait. The data will be computed. One of the Earth humans must have experience of our methods. Projection of all identities on the Wheel is essential.

[Rocket control room]

JAMIE: Zoe, I've found the rod. Look! This is the 
(Zoe has the Oxygen supply room on the monitor.) 
ZOE: The Cybermen. I must have broken in on their frequency. This may be important.

[Oxygen supply room]

(The Cyberman communicates with Vallance via the head device.) 
CYBERMAN: Stare into the box. Think of each individual human being at present on the Wheel. Form the image in your eyes. 
(Over the image of the Planner we see the crew as Vallance names them.) 
VALLANCE: Tanya Lernov, Astrogater, Second Class. 
PLANNER [OC]: Negative. 
VALLANCE: Leo Ryan, Communications Officer. 
PLANNER [OC]: Negative. 
VALLANCE: Jarvis Bennett, Space Station Controller. 
PLANNER [OC]: Negative.

[Rocket control room]

ZOE: They seem to be talking about the whole crew of the Wheel, one after the other. 
JAMIE: But why? What're they after? 
VALLANCE [OC]: Zoe Heriot, Astrophysicist.

[Oxygen supply room]

VALLANCE: Astrometricist, First Class. 
PLANNER [OC]: Negative. 
VALLANCE: Doctor. I don't know who he is. 
PLANNER [OC]: Name. 
VALLANCE: I don't know. 
PLANNER [OC]: Name? 
VALLANCE: I don't know. I don't know

[Wheel Operations room]

RYAN: But what possible use could the Wheel be to these Cybermen, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: That remains to be seen. 
RYAN: I don't see why you don't accept my theory that they're simply attacking us. 
DOCTOR: But they wouldn't go to all this trouble just to knock out one small space Wheel. 
LERNOV: Leo! There's something on radar. 
RYAN: What? 
CASALI: It's not a meteorite. Look, it's changing course. 
LERNOV: There are no ships due in this part of space. 
CASALI: Anyway, it's too big for one of our ships. 
DOCTOR: It could be a Cyberman spaceship. 
RYAN: Moving in for the kill. 
DOCTOR: Possibly. 
RYAN: What about radio, Rico? We must contact Earth for assistance. 
CASALI: Oh no, not a chance, though I could fix it up okay but I need some transistors and they're in the Power Room. 
RYAN: Then one of us will have to go and get 'em.

[Rocket control room]

PLANNER [OC]: Positive. The Doctor is known and recorded. An enemy. He must be lured outside the force field and destroyed. 
JAMIE: They're going to try and trap the Doctor. Come on, let's get back and warn him.

[Wheel Operations room]

(Looking at blueprints of the Wheel.) 
LERNOV: And these are corridors leading to Power Room. 
RYAN: Well that's no good. We don't know where those Cybermen'll be. 
LERNOV: How else is he going to get there? Though the cable tunnels? 
RYAN: No, no, they're blocked off here and here. That just leaves the emergency air tunnel. 
FLANNIGAN [on monitor]: Captain. 
RYAN: Flannigan! Where are you? 
FLANNIGAN [on monitor]: In the corridor outside the Spares and Workshop. I've got a whole bunch of them locked up in the Workshop. 
RYAN: Is the way clear through to the Power House? 
FLANNIGAN [on monitor]: It is, but they're melting down the doors. I can't hold them for much longer. 
RYAN: Well, look, one of us has got to come for some radio spares. Will you bottle them up as long as possible? 
FLANNIGAN [on monitor]: Right. I will seal off the other compartments but you'd better send someone quickly for them spares. 
RYAN: Right. 
FLANNIGAN [on monitor]: They may be trying the other doors. 
DOCTOR: Excuse me. Tell him I will go for the spares. 
RYAN: You? Well, surely it's better if I go. 
DOCTOR: I think that it's essential that I go. 
RYAN: All right, it's your neck. Look, Flannigan, the Doctor's coming for the spares. Now, hold them back for as long as you can. 
FLANNIGAN [on monitor]: I will meet up with the Doctor in corridor six. 
RYAN: Right. 
DOCTOR: Now listen, as soon as Flannigan comes through the force field, grab him! 
RYAN: Grab him? What for? 
LERNOV: And he isn't coming here. Didn't you hear him? He's going to meet you in corridor six. 
DOCTOR: I somehow don't think he will. Now please do as I say. I'll have the map. Now remember, don't trust him. Check the metal plate on the back of his neck. 
LERNOV: But you'll get

[Corridor]

(Flannigan meets a Cyberman.) 
FLANNIGAN: The Doctor is coming to corridor six. 
CYBERMAN: Return to the Operations room. Destroy the force field after they let you through. 
(Jamie and Zoe are space-walking back to the Wheel.) 
[Power room]

(The Doctor opens a grating in the wall and climbs through. He goes over to a trolley and picks up a small bottle.) 
DOCTOR: Ah, mercury. 
(He pockets the bottle, picks up a circuit board and checks the corridor outside is clear. Then he goes to a workbench and picks up some coils of wire.) DOCTOR: Yes, I don't see why it shouldn't work.

[Landing bay]

(Out of their spacesuits, Jamie and Zoe come in through the emergency exit and see Corwyn on the floor.) 
JAMIE: Doctor Corwyn! 
(She is clearly dead. They go up the steps. Shortly afterwards they walk through a door labelled Oxygen Supply room into -)

[Corridor]

ZOE: Flannigan! 
FLANNIGAN: What are you two doing wandering about? Them creatures are all over the place. 
JAMIE: We know they are. 
FLANNIGAN: Follow me. This way's quicker. 
(Flannigan, Zoe and Jamie leave, the Cyberman and Vallance enter.) 
CYBERMAN: The Doctor has not come. 
VALLANCE: He must have gone another way. 
CYBERMAN: How? 
VALLANCE: Through the air tunnels. There is one leading to the Power Room. 
CYBERMAN: Show me.

[Wheel Operations room]

(Flannigan enters with Jamie and Zoe. Ryan spots him and grabs him before he can touch a control panel.) 
JAMIE: Hey, what you doing? 
ZOE: He led us here! 
LERNOV: He was under Cyberman influence. 
JAMIE: What? 
(Ryan puts the anti-hypnosis device on the back of Flannigan's neck.) 
RYAN: Right, he'll be all right now. Sit him down over there for a while, Rico. 
ZOE: You mean he was being controlled? 
RYAN: Yes. You were dead lucky. 
JAMIE: Aye. Here, where's the Doctor? The Cybermen are going to try and lure him away and trap him. 
LERNOV: He's already gone. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: I've got the spares. 
JAMIE: Doctor, be careful! 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Jamie! Oh thank heavens. Are you and Zoe all right? 
JAMIE: Yes. Now listen. The Cybermen know you're on the Wheel. They're going to try and trap you. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Yes, yes, I guessed they would. Have you got the Time Vector Generator? 
JAMIE: Yes. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Good! Now, now listen to me, I want you to bring it to me. Get someone to show you the way through the air corridors. Hello. I think I've got company. 
(Transmission ends.) 
JAMIE: Company? What does he mean? (the penny drops) Company!

[Power room]

(Two Cyberman are standing in front of the door.) 
DOCTOR: I suppose you've come for me. 
CYBERMAN 1: You know our ways. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I thought you'd realise somebody did. I imagine you have orders to destroy me. 
CYBERMAN 2: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Tell me one thing. Why did you order Duggan to destroy radio communication with the Earth? After all, that is why you want possession of the Wheel, isn't it? 
CYBERMAN 1: You know our ways. 
DOCTOR: That doesn't answer my question. 
CYBERMAN 2: He was instructed to destroy only the transmitting complex. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. How interesting. Yes, of course. And presumably your large spaceship holds your invasion fleet, and the smaller ships can only enter the Earth's atmosphere by homing on a radio beam.
CYBERMAN 2: You know our ways. You must be destroyed. 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I was afraid you'd get back to that. Well, you'd better come in. 
(Cyberman 1 steps forward, the Doctor throws a switch and electricity crackles through its headpiece. It collapses. Number two tries to use its chest unit.) 
DOCTOR: You can't get through the field, you know. 
CYBERMAN 2: You will be destroyed. Others are coming. 
(Cyberman 2 leaves. The Doctor turns off the electric field. Jamie comes through the grating with Flannigan.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie! Is he all right? 
JAMIE: Yes. 
FLANNIGAN: I've got a head like a big bass drum. Somebody's going to pay for this. 
JAMIE: Oh, it looks like the Doctor's already made one of them pay. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but they're sending in reinforcements, probably through the Loading Bay. Have you got the rod? Thank you. I'm going to try and fix this into the laser gun circuit. With any luck, I should be able to boost the power enough to destroy the Cyberman spaceship. But you'll have to hold them off at the loading bay. I need time. 
FLANNIGAN: Right, leave that to me. 
DOCTOR: Well, there's still a Cyberman left, so watch out for him. 
(Flannigan picks up a mini-extinguisher.) 
FLANNIGAN: Well, I think I know just the thing for him. 
DOCTOR: Good. Here's a metal plate for Vallance. 
(Jamie catches it.) 
JAMIE: Leo Ryan says you're to call him. 
(Jamie leaves.) 
FLANNIGAN: Let's see how them creatures like this stuff! 
(Flannigan leaves.)

[Wheel Operations room]

CASALI: That ship's closing in on us. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: I'm trying to put some extra power in your laser. Line it up on the Cyberman spaceship and I'll let you know when I'm ready. 
RYAN: Right. Well you'd better hurry, Doctor. That ship's moving toward us. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Yes, I know. They're going to invade us.

[Loading bay]

(Jamie and Flannigan are in full space suits. The Cyberman and Vallance are there. Vallance is also suited up.) 
FLANNIGAN: I could not get through the force field to the Operations room, and I caught this man on the way back. 
CYBERMAN: He is not important.

[Power room]

RYAN [on monitor]: Hurry, Doctor. Hurry! 
DOCTOR: Yes, all right.

[Loading bay]

(A group of Cybermen are spacewalking to the Wheel. When the Cyberman turns his back, Flannigan and Jamie approach Vallance, and Jamie puts the metal plate on the back of his helmet.) 
JAMIE: Got it! Flannigan! 
(The Cyberman walks towards them so Flannigan uses his extinguisher device on its chest unit. It turns out to be quick drying plastic, and the Cyberman collapses as it reaches for the door controls. The spacewalking Cybermen are just paces away as Flannigan shuts the outer doors, but the lead one wedges itself between them and tries to force them open.) 
JAMIE: Use the plastic again. 
FLANNIGAN: I can't. I wasted it all on the other one.

[Wheel Operations room]

DOCTOR [on monitor]: Right. Everything is ready here. 
LERNOV: Ready, Leo. 
RYAN: Red on standby. And fire! 
(The Cybermen's space ship goes KaBOOM!)

[Loading bay]

FLANNIGAN: I'll try and operate the neutron force-field. Hold tight! 
(The forcefield repels the Cybermen, and the outer doors close. Flannigan repressurises the bay and they all remove their helmets.) 
JAMIE: Oh, we've done it.

[Wheel Operations room]

CASALI: Earth Central, stand by for emergency report. 
VOICE [OC]: Earth Central. Contract clear. Standing by. 
RYAN: Where's Zoe? 
LERNOV: She's gone to take the Doctor and Jamie back to the rocket. 
VOICE [OC]: Earth Central standing by with recording apparatus. Commence report. 
RYAN: Hello, Earth Central. This is Captain Ryan, acting controller of Station Three. 
VOICE [OC]: Recording in progress. Go ahead, Captain. 
RYAN: Preliminary report on communications failure. Radio contact lost at approximately twelve fifty two hours due to invasion of alien force. Full report to follow. All systems now operational. Request official permission to assume responsibility.

[Rocket control room]

ZOE: So I've just got to go back? 
JAMIE: I'm afraid so. 
ZOE: And you won't tell me anything about this, what is it? 
JAMIE: Tardis. 
ZOE: Oh, yes. I asked the Doctor what it meant. Time And Relative Dimensions In Space, he said. 
JAMIE: Er, yes. 
ZOE: But you won't explain it. 
JAMIE: Well, you see Zoe, it's, well, it's like two different worlds. Look, you've got yours and the Doctor and me have ours. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Jamie! 
JAMIE: Look, you've been. Well, look, Zoe, we won't forget you.

[Tardis]

(The Doctor pours the mercury through a funnel into the console, then switches on.) 
JAMIE: All set? 
DOCTOR: Yes. I've even got some mercury left over. 
JAMIE: Oh, we can go then. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think 
(The lid of a carved blanket box or chest lowers itself gently.) 
DOCTOR: Just a little matter to settle first, I think, Jamie. 
(The Doctor knocks on the lid and opens it.) 
JAMIE: Hey, I thought I told you 
ZOE: I want to go with you. 
JAMIE: Well, it's impossible. 
DOCTOR: Now, Jamie, it's not impossible. It's something that we have to decide. You may change your mind. 
ZOE: No, I won't. 
DOCTOR: I wonder. Zoe, watch the screen up there. 
(The Doctor takes a small head piece from behind a roundel and puts it on.) 
JAMIE: What are you going to do? 
DOCTOR: I'm going to show Zoe the sort of thing that she may be in for. 
ZOE: Thought patterns? 
DOCTOR: Yes. Only I'm going to weave them into a complete story for you. Have you ever heard of the Daleks? 
ZOE: No. 
DOCTOR: Then watch. 
DALEK [on monitor]: Who are you? Who are you? Answer! 
(That is the reprise from episode two of Evil of the Daleks, which was repeated on BBC after this story.)


Episode One
[Outside the saucer]

(A delta wave of classic flying saucers flies through space. We watch one of them land on a planet, its landing struts holding the body of the saucer clear of the rocky ground. A transport tube is lowered, and the outer and inner doors open. A humanoid steps out onto the planet. The high curved shoulders of his outfit make him look as if his neck is joined part way down his chest. As he surveys the scenery, a second man joins him. The first man speaks.) 
RAGO: Is the local radiation completely absorbed? 
(Played by the handsome Ronald Allen, if you're interested.) 
TOBA: Yes, its energy's been transferred to our fuel reserves. But we need much more. 
RAGO: Of course, that is why we are here. 
TOBA: With respect, Navigator Rago, I still consider we should have continued to Epsilon Four. 
RAGO: I decided otherwise, Probationer Toba. 
TOBA: But this planet has never been fully surveyed. 
RAGO: It's suitable for our purpose. The planetary crust is thin here, and there is a intelligent form of life suitable for a work force. 
TOBA: But the natives may not be suitable for slave labour. Suppose they're hostile? 
RAGO: If necessary we shall destroy them. 
TOBA: Yes, destroy them. 
RAGO: But only if necessary. Commence work on the preliminary survey. 
TOBA: Command accepted. Shall I order the Quarks to mark out the drilling sites? 
RAGO: Yes. 
TOBA: Quarks!

[Hovercraft]

(Elsewhere, a large egg-shaped craft is travelling through the mists. The humanoids in here wear thick corset-style dresses over sleeveless singlets, and seem far less belligerent than the newcomers.) 
WAHED: (dark top) I'm not so sure that this so-called adventure was such a good idea after all. I mean, this is a terribly primitive way to travel isn't it? 
ETNIN: (floor length long sleeves) Well, we are supposed to be looking for excitement, aren't we? 
TOLATA: (woman) That's why I came. 
WAHED: I really don't see what's so exciting about sitting for hours on end in this old tub. If we'd used a travel capsule we could have been here in a few minutes. 
CULLY: (pilot - knee length, light top) Not without a permit, you wouldn't. 
WAHED: I suppose that does add a little zest. 
CULLY: Well, here we are everyone, the Island of Death! Uninhabited for one hundred and seventy years. Nothing can live on this poisonous plot of soil. 
WAHED: You're being melodramatic again, Cully, as usual. You know perfectly well there's a permanent survey unit there to monitor the radiation. 
ETNIN: And there's a weekly visit by parties of students to show them the horror of atomic radiation. 
CULLY: All right, all right, I know. But all this is organised and supervised by the state. You've travelled miles by sea in a ship navigated by man. None of your auto-piloting. And don't forget we're here without permits. All this is illegal. 
ETNIN: Yes, I'd almost forgotten that. 
CULLY: An adventure with Cully is something never to be forgotten. 
WAHED: It doesn't look any different to me from the way I've seen it in vision-books on my own screen at home. 
CULLY: Ah, but this time it's real. 
WAHED: Is it? 
CULLY: Well yes, of course it is. You're actually here. 
WAHED: Are we? 
CULLY: You don't believe me. 
WAHED: Well, you could be throwing up old pictures on your scanner, couldn't you? After all, there's nothing to show that it is real. 
CULLY: Well you can't get out and see. 
WAHED: Why not? 
TOLATA: Yes, why not? 
CULLY: Look, I'm all for a bit of danger, but going out on that island without protective suits would be madness. 
WAHED: So we just have to take your word for it, Cully. 
CULLY: Yes you do. 
TOLATA: Didn't you mention something about a warning signal? 
CULLY: Yes, when we're in the radiation zone. Why? 
TOLATA: Well, aren't we a bit close? 
ETNIN: Do something, Cully! 
WAHED: We're going to crash! 
TOLATA: Quickly, Cully! 
(The enclosed craft slams into the beach at the bask of a cliff and everyone gets thrown to the floor. Wahed hurts his elbow.) 
CULLY: We're stuck. 
WAHED: Mm? 
TOLATA: Oh no! 
WAHED: Do you mean permanently? 
CULLY: Yes, we've run aground. The drive is well and truly wedged in solid. 
WAHED: Well, how are we supposed to get back to the mainland? 
CULLY: Look, don't ask me. 
ETNIN: This really is an adventure, isn't it. 
WAHED: Are you sure this isn't one of your practical jokes, Cully? 
CULLY: Now look, running aground on an atomic island isn't my idea of fun. 
WAHED: Yes, but is that where we really are? 
(Wahed waves a stick over some control panels.) 
WAHED: The radiation meter's registering zero. 
CULLY: Yes. Odd. Well, they've probably broken down. 
WAHED: Let's try again, shall we? Clear the computers. Now. 
CULLY: Zero? But it can't be. 
WAHED: So much for your navigation, Cully. Island of Death. 
(A ramp drops down onto the beach and Etnin walks out.) 
CULLY: All right, go out there. Get yourselves cooked to a frazzle by the radiation, but don't come complaining to me if you get yourselves killed, because I don't refund money to 
(But they have all left.) 
CULLY: Refund? What am I saying, they haven't even paid me yet! Hey, wait!

[Outside the hovercraft]

CULLY: Oh Tolata, don't be a little fool. This island is a killer. 
TOLATA: So you say, but your radiation counter didn't seem to be making too much of a fuss about it. 
CULLY: Yes, I know, but, well, it must have gone bust. 
WAHED: And all the others in this tub of yours as well? 
TOLATA: Why don't you admit it, Cully. You're a rogue, This isn't the test island, is it. 
CULLY: But I tell you it is! 
ETNIN: Wahed! Over the hill. People. 
WAHED: People? Well, that settles it rather, doesn't it Cully? No one ever visits the Island of Death, do they. 
CULLY: Well, there's the survey unit, or they could be students. Were they wearing protective suits? 
ETNIN: No, but they had a new type of robot. 
WAHED: A work party most probably. Come on Etnin, let's go and seek their assistance in getting us off this dreary island which Cully has so carelessly marooned us on. 
CULLY: No, wait! Wahed! Stop!

[Outside the saucer]

TOBA: Quarks. You will set up the drilling site in accordance with the instructions of Domin 
(He stops, watching the adventurers running over the ridge.) 
CULLY: Wait! Stop! 
TOBA: Quarks, destroy them! 
CULLY: Oh get down, quickly! They're going to. Get down! 
(Cully ducks down behind a dune as the other three suddenly freeze then fall.) 
TOBA: Quarks, reload force units. 
RAGO: Trouble? 
TOBA: I have dealt with it. Three alien beings of the planet. 
RAGO: Dead. 
TOBA: Of course. 
RAGO: That was unnecessary!

[Beach]

(Cully walks past, then the Tardis materialises. The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe come out.) 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, oh yes. Ahh! 
JAMIE: Are you still feeling tired, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes, just a little bit weary, Jamie. It's a very exhausting business projecting all those mental images, you know. 
ZOE: You need a good rest, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes, we all do. A nice holiday. 
JAMIE: Oh, where did you say this place was again? 
ZOE: Well the scanner screen in the Tardis showed it as an island of some sort surrounded by a sea of mist. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
DOCTOR: Yes, it's an island on Dulkis, a perfectly splendid planet. 
JAMIE: Aye, I've heard that one before. 
ZOE: And there won't be any Cybermen or Daleks, will there? 
DOCTOR: No, no, no, of course not. There's nothing unpleasant on Dulkis. 
ZOE: Well, is the whole island as dreary as this? 
DOCTOR: Oh no, goodness me, no. They're a very advanced race, the Dulcians. And they're very gentle too. And friendly. You're going to like them. 
(The Doctor hands Zoe a large keep net.) 
JAMIE: Oh I see, you've been here before. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, Jamie. Blow that up for me would you? 
JAMIE: Eh? 
(The Doctor gives him an inflatable ball.) 
DOCTOR: Yes. Some time ago, mind you. It was splendid. It was so peaceful. I just didn't want to leave. 
(He brings out a deckchair and sits down.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what we all need. A nice, peaceful holiday.

[Cliff top]

(Toba is looking down on the hovercraft. A little way along, Cully starts down the slope to his craft.) 
TOBA: Quarks. Destroy the alien vessel. 
(Cully hears the whoop-whoop of an energy build up and retreats. His hovercraft goes kaBOOM! and he plays dead just in case.)

[Outside the museum]

(Our travellers have heard the explosion and come running.) 
JAMIE: I thought you said it was a peaceful planet? 
ZOE: Well which direction did it come from? It sounded as though it was almost on top of us. 
JAMIE: Hey, now would you look at that. 
(Jamie walks through the missing side of a building made of hexagonal blocks.) 
ZOE: Did you say these people were peaceful Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well yes, Zoe, they. But Dulcians are gentle and friendly! 
JAMIE: Aye, it sounded like it. Did the explosion cause this? 
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. This was caused by an explosion some time ago, Jamie. 
ZOE: Looks like atomic blast damage to me. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think you're right, Zoe. But I don't understand it. Let's look inside, shall we? 
(The Doctor helps Zoe over some fallen debris as they go to a metal door in an intact wall.) 
DOCTOR: Mind. Over here.

[Museum]

(Jamie pushes the door open, and it creaks very nicely.) 
JAMIE: Hey, what sort of place is this? 
ZOE: Looks like some sort of museum. 
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right again, Zoe. A war museum! 
JAMIE: Peaceful, you said. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, but these are very old fashioned weapons, Jamie. This sort of thing was banned ages ago. 
(Jamie takes a ray gun off it's display stand.) 
JAMIE: Hey, how you work this sort of thing? 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie, no! Put that down! 
JAMIE: What's the matter? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's a sort of laser gun. You know what that'll do. It'll burn a hole through anything. Metal, concrete, wood, anything! It may look old, but, well, you never know. It just might go off. Now please, just leave things as they were. Where was it? 
ZOE: I wonder what's down here? 
JAMIE: Is that the trigger there? 
DOCTOR: Well that seems to be something 
ZOE: Look! 
JAMIE: What's the matter? What? 
(Zoe points at two motionless figures.) 
JAMIE: What's happened to them? 
DOCTOR: Stay here, Zoe. Come on, Jamie. 
(The Doctor goes down the steps to the figures then laughs.) 
JAMIE: Well, what are you laughing at? Oh, they're just dummies! What did they put them in here for? 
DOCTOR: They're dummies. 
ZOE: Dummies? Did you check? DOCTOR: Huh? 
ZOE: Did you check the radiation level before we left the Tardis? 
DOCTOR: That's just what I was thinking. Zoe, I think I did, I. Yes, I'm sure I did. 
JAMIE: Hey, what are you two on about? 
ZOE: Well I was just thinking. This place reminds me of the old atom-test islands on Earth. 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I think you're right, Zoe. 
JAMIE: Test islands? 
ZOE: For atomic weapons, Jamie. 
DOCTOR: But, but, but why on Dulkis? They've outlawed war! There must be some other explanation. 
JAMIE: Aye, well, I vote we go back to the Tardis and find somewhere else. 
ZOE: Doctor! 
(Three figures in full environmental protection suits are standing in the doorway.)

[Survey unit]

(In a complex of buildings on top of a hill, the three Dulcians are removing their protection suits.) 
BALAN: (older man) Oh, I hope we're not too late. If they were out there for any length of time. How badly are they affected? 
KANDO: (girl) I don't know, Educator Balan. 
BALAN: Oh, come now, Kando. I've taught you how to read a radiation meter. But this is registering negative. Are you sure you've switched it on? 
KANDO: Yes. 
BALAN: How is yours, Teel? 
TEEL: (boy) Exactly the same, sir, Zero. 
BALAN: It's very strange. 
(There is thumping and shouting off screen.) 
TEEL: Could it be that the meters aren't working, sir? 
BALAN: Oh no, the warning lights would have gone on if the circuits had failed. 
KANDO: Well, we can't leave them in there indefinitely. 
BALAN: No, that's true. Teel, as they're not radioactive we may as well let them out. (Teel opens a door, and the Doctor, Jamie, Zoe and a lot of steam come out.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, my beautiful coat is all wet. 
ZOE: Thank goodness for that. 
JAMIE: Ridiculous! 
DOCTOR: All this is totally unnecessary, you know. There's not a trace of contamination on us. 
BALAN: Yes, so I've noticed. It's odd isn't it? 
DOCTOR: What's odd about it? 
BALAN: Well, the whole island is radioactive. It has been for a hundred and seventy two years, you must know that. 
ZOE: Well it isn't now. 
KANDO: Of course it is. 
DOCTOR: Have you checked? 
TEEL: Well, not yet. We've only just arrived. We'll be taking the annual readings during the next few days. 
DOCTOR: Well, if I were you I'd take them now. 
BALAN: I wasn't aware that anyone else had permission to work on the island except ourselves. Tell me exactly what has been happening. 
DOCTOR: But, but I was hoping you were going to tell us that. 
ZOE: This is an atom test island, isn't it? 
BALAN: Oh but of course. Everybody knows that. 
JAMIE: Ah, well, we don't. 
DOCTOR: But atomic weapons on Dulkis? I thought war had been abolished here. 
BALAN: It has. You seem to know surprisingly little about your own planet. 
JAMIE: Ah well, that's it, you see. We've just come in the Tar 
(The Doctor gestures Jamie to be quiet.) 
DOCTOR: Well, as Jamie was about to say, we come from a different world, from a different time. 
BALAN: Not from this world? Really, that's very interesting. I must note that in my daily report. 
ZOE: Well, you don't sound very surprised. 
BALAN: Well, it does explain how you came to expose yourself to the dangers on this island. No Dulcian would do such a foolish thing. 
JAMIE: Oh? What are you doing here then? 
KANDO: We're part of Educator Balan's expedition from the university. 
DOCTOR: But when I was here some time ago, you were a peaceful race. What 
BALAN: Ah, so you've been here before? 
DOCTOR: Well, yes. 
BALAN: Ah, I must put that in my. I'm so sorry. You were saying? 
DOCTOR: Well, well, what's happened to you? I thought aggressive weapons had been abolished? 
BALAN: Oh, indeed they have, under the second council, under Director Olin. He banned the manufacture of all weapons. 
DOCTOR: Then what are you doing letting off atomic devices all over the place? 
BALAN: Oh, there was only one explosion. Perhaps my pupil Kando should explain. Let's see how much you remember, my dear. 
KANDO: Er. 
BALAN: The Seventh Council. 
KANDO: The Seventh Council under Director Malos initiated research which led to the development of atomic energy. The dest 
BALAN: Destructive capabilities. 
KANDO: The destructive capabilities of this were immediately apparent, and 
BALAN: This island. 
KANDO: And this island was used to test an explosive device, the results of which can be seen today. Thereafter all further research into this type of energy was prohibited, and the island was kept as both a museum and warning for future generations. 
JAMIE: Oh well, she certainly does her homework. 
DOCTOR: I see. Then this is an atomic test site? 
BALAN: Oh, yes. You see, students are. That was really very good, Kando. Students are brought here to test the radiation level and observe the effect on the vegetation. And of course, to see for themselves the horrors of atomic destruction. 
ZOE: So there should be radioactivity here? 
JAMIE: But there isn't. 
DOCTOR: No. I wonder why?

[Outside the saucer]

RAGO: And you destroyed this travel ship? 
TOBA: You gave me no order to the contrary. 
RAGO: You are a Probationer Navigator. Your first task is to investigate, second assess. You allowed your instinct for destruction to interfere with your primary task. 
TOBA: Not accepted. 
RAGO: How can you assess that which does not exist? Have you completed your atomic analysis? 
TOBA: Analysis complete. Atomic energy released on this island seventeen point two decades ago. 
RAGO: A long time. Strange that this should be the only trace of radiation on this planet. Continue. 
TOBA: Drilling sites have now been located and marked. 
RAGO: Then we will examine them.

[Outside the Tardis]

(Cully has found the Tardis and is examining it. Then he notices an star-like mark on the ground nearby. He hides as Toba and Rago approach.) 
TOBA: This is the eastern drilling site. 
RAGO: What is that? 
TOBA: Just a crude, box-like structure. Shall I summon the Quarks to destroy it? 
RAGO: Why? Will it interfere with the work? 
TOBA: No, but 
RAGO: Then it would be wasteful to destroy it.

[Outside the museum]

(A radiation-suited figure examines another star-like mark on the ground, then hides as Cully comes through a hole in a wall.) 
TEEL: Cully, what are you doing here? 
CULLY: Who is it? Who's that over there? 
TEEL: My name is Teel. You remember. I'm with the survey team. 
CULLY: Survey? Right. Take me to your survey unit. 
TEEL: Yes, but 
CULLY: Come on. Don't argue. 
TEEL: Oh, very well. It's over this way. 
(Teel and Cully leave as Rago and Toba enter.) 
RAGO: Here. Evidently a test site. It would explain the radiation.

[Museum]

TOBA: Primitive architecture. 
RAGO: Every culture develops, Probationer Toba. Never base an assumption on the past. Examine the present. 
TOBA: Yes, Navigator Rago. You were right. It was a test site. 
RAGO: Come here. Explain. 
(Rago is by the laser rifle.) 
TOBA: Part of this collection of crude weapons. 
RAGO: Continue. 
TOBA: Well, this one operates on the early laser principle. Fire mechanism here. 
(Toba demonstrates by blasting a hole in the wall.) 
TOBA: Self-charging power cell. Limited range. 
RAGO: That's all you notice? 
TOBA: The other weapons are just as simple. There's nothing here that could threaten us. These things are so old that 
RAGO: Precisely! Old! At last you casually mention a fact of major significance. Has it not occurred to you, Probationer Toba, that other weapons must have been developed since these? 
TOBA: Agreed, Navigator Rago. 
RAGO: I reproved you at the time of your precipitate act of self-gratification in destroying those three creatures. It will now be necessary to find other specimens. They will have to be investigated.

[Survey unit]

(Kando is handing round drinks.) 
DOCTOR: But why do you think we might be responsible? Thank you. 
BALAN: Well it is conceivable that your craft, the er? 
DOCTOR: Tardis. 
BALAN: The Tardis could have attracted the radioactivity in much the same way as a magnet attracts metal. 
DOCTOR: Oh, it would have registered. 
ZOE: Do spacecraft often land in Dulkis? 
KANDO: As far as I know, you are the first. 
JAMIE: Oh I must say then, you don't seem the least bit surprised. 
KANDO: We are taught to accept facts, being foolish to contemplate fantasy in the face of reality. You are here. This is fact. That you come from another planet I accept because I have no other means of proving it. 
(Teel enters with Cully.) 
TEEL: Not a sign of radiation, but look what I found. 
BALAN: Cully, what are you? 
CULLY: Never mind that now. We've got to get back to the capital. 
BALAN: Oh, it's impossible. We haven't even begun our survey yet. 
CULLY: If you don't, you'll be wiped out. 
TEEL: He claims to have seen robots and spacecraft. 
BALAN: You didn't tell me you brought robots. 
DOCTOR: I haven't! 
CULLY: Look, I brought three people here in my ship. They've been killed by those creatures. 
(Balan laughs.) 
ZOE: Well, what's so funny? 
BALAN: Now I see it. Yes, three people. So, you come from another world, do you Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Eh? I don't think I 
BALAN: Really, Cully, you and your friends might at least have agreed upon the same story. 
CULLY: What? But these aren't my three, you old f! Oh, what's the use. 
JAMIE: What's he talking about? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. Look, I've never seen this gentleman before in my life. 
BALAN: Cully, you had no right to bring these people here without permission, even if you are the son of the Director of the Council. 
CULLY: Well, go on then, why don't you call him up? At least he's not as stupid as you are. 
DOCTOR: You say you've seen a spacecraft? 
CULLY: Well, I've told you, haven't I. And robots. Well, at least I think they were robots. 
DOCTOR: What exactly did this spacecraft look like? 
CULLY: Well it's large and circular and a sort of silvery colour. 
JAMIE: Ah, that means it can't be the Tardis. 
DOCTOR: Are you sure it wasn't square, like a large wooden box? 
CULLY: No, no, that's not the spacecraft. No, the box is where those aliens have made a sort of mark. A five pointed star. They were examining just now, talking about destroying it. 
DOCTOR + JAMIE + ZOE: What! 
DOCTOR: Jamie, we'd better go and see. 
JAMIE: Come on. 
BALAN: You're wasting your time. 
DOCTOR: I prefer to make up my own mind, thank you. Jamie. Are you coming, Zoe? 
ZOE: No, I think I'll stay here. 
DOCTOR: Right, we shan't be a minute. 
JAMIE: Come on then. 
DOCTOR: Are you sure there's no radioactivity? 
TEEL: Certain. 
DOCTOR: Good. 
(The Doctor and Jamie leave.) 
ZOE: Why do you think they're wasting their time, Balan? 
CULLY: Because they all think I'm a liar. 
BALAN: Oh.

[Outside the saucer]

RAGO: Commence work on preparing the sites of the outer bore holes. 
TOBA: At once, Navigator Rago. 
RAGO: Send this message to Fleet Leader. Materials located, detailed report follows. 
TOBA: Command accepted.

[Survey unit]

BALAN: No. No, I'm sorry, Cully. I'm taking no action until I've spoken to your father. 
CULLY: But all this is just wasting time, and anyway you know full well what the old man's going to say. Do nothing. 
BALAN: Yes, and better that than setting the whole of Dulkis in a panic. Besides, Cully, I think you should show more respect, if not to me, at least to your father. 
CULLY: My father? The great Senex, leader of the Dulcians? He's as bad as the rest of you. Vegetables, the lot of you. You don't live, you exist. 
BALAN: Haven't you got through yet, Teel? 
TEEL: There seems to be some sort of interference. 
CULLY: Ah, there you are. Robots are causing that. What did I tell you? 
ZOE: You don't seem to be having much success with them, do you? 
CULLY: Idiots. Blind idiots they are. Still, at least your Doctor friend showed some interest. 
ZOE: Yes, he has an enquiring mind. 
CULLY: In that case he'll end up as unpopular as I am.

[Outside the Tardis]

JAMIE: Ah, at least they haven't harmed the Tardis. 
DOCTOR: That's a relief. Jamie, come and have a look at this. It's interesting. Look. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: See? 
JAMIE: Oh, what's so interesting about that? 
DOCTOR: Well I think it must be some sort of survey mark. 
JAMIE: Very likely. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, look. 
(There are two lines of closely spaced oblongs in the sand.) 
DOCTOR: Some sort of tracks. 
JAMIE: So they are. 
DOCTOR: Let's follow them, shall we? 
(Further along the beach they can see the saucer up on the cliff.) 
JAMIE: Hey, look at that! 
DOCTOR: Now that really is interesting.

[Outside the saucer]

JAMIE: Oh look, I think we'd better get back. Zoe'll be wondering what's happening. 
DOCTOR: Oh this is interesting, yes. Obviously an interstellar spaceship of considerably advanced design. 
JAMIE: Oh no. You're not thinking what I think you're thinking, are you? 
DOCTOR: That, I think, Jamie, depends upon what you think I am thinking. 
JAMIE: Och. Hey, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Stop it. 
JAMIE: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Jamie, don't do it. 
JAMIE: Doctor, look! 
DOCTOR: Oh my word! (Looking down from the next hill are two rectangular beings with round heads with points sticking out of them. Their voices sound like sweet little girls.) 
QUARK: Do not move. Do not move. 
(Toba appears.) 
QUARK: Next task? Shall we destroy? Shall we destroy? 
(One Quark unfolds a weapon arm from its body.)

Episode Two

[Saucer]

RAGO: Bring them inside. 
(A Quark hustles the Doctor and Jamie out of the airlock and into the massive control room, followed by Toba. There is a raised dais in the middle with a separate control unit.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, good heavens. 
JAMIE: Look, what's going on? Who are you? 
(Rago and Toba step onto the dais.) 
RAGO: We are Dominators. Both of you stand by that wall. 
JAMIE: I will not. 
DOCTOR: Now, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Oh no, they're not going to 
TOBA: We are meant to be obeyed. 
JAMIE: Not by me you're not. 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
(A Quark moves towards Jamie with two weapon arms pointing at him.) 
JAMIE: Wha? Oh, if you insist. 
(Jamie goes towards the wall then is suddenly pulled onto it, stuck like glue.) 
JAMIE: Doctor, I can't move. Help me! 
(But the Doctor is pulled to the wall as well.) 
RAGO: It is pointless to struggle. My Quarks have used a molecular force to bind your bodies to the wall. 
JAMIE: What's he going do with us? 
(Toba touches a control and the piece of wall Jamie is stuck to turns into a table.) 
RAGO: Alien races are occasionally of use to us. I intend to probe your physiological make up. 
DOCTOR: Do what? 
JAMIE: Doctor, can you not do anything? 
DOCTOR: Don't struggle, Jamie. Keep still. 
RAGO: Toba. 
TOBA: Quarks, attach force units. Activate. 
(The Quarks put their arms on the bottom of the table.) 
RAGO: Visor! Transmatter focus probe. 
(Rago looks through the visor at Jamie.) 
RAGO: Brittle skeletal structure. Reasonable flexibility. A certain amount of muscular force. Could be marginally useful. Vulnerable, only one heart. 
TOBA: Intelligence? 
RAGO: A simple brain. Signs of recent rapid learning. Still, somewhat crude. 
TOBA: Shall I prepare the other specimen for scrutiny? 
RAGO: No, they will be identical. Conserve power. 
(The Quarks disconnect and the table becomes a wall panel again.) 
TOBA: Are they dangerous? 
RAGO: No, they are physically inferior. 
TOBA: So we destroy them? 
RAGO: No. It is possible we may use them. 
TOBA: What for? 
RAGO: Workforce. 
TOBA: We've got the Quarks. 
RAGO: We must conserve their power, you know that! 
TOBA: But why do you want? (gets a Look from Rago) Command accepted. 
RAGO: Set up a reaction test. 
(Rago goes over to the Doctor.) 
RAGO: Test this one.

[Survey unit]

(The video connection is very poor.) 
SENEX [on monitor]: Your picture is fading, Balan. Your picture is fading. 
CULLY: Never mind the picture, Father. The important thing is, what are you going to do? 
SENEX [on monitor]: I can't hear you, Balan. Send Cully and the strangers to the Capital. I'll question them there. 
(Transmission ends.) 
CULLY: Father? Father! Can't you get them back? 
TEEL: They've switched off the reception I'm afraid. 
CULLY: Oh, switched off? That's typical, isn't it. Typical Dulcian behaviour. Something strange, something you don't understand and you switch off. (taps his head) Up here. 
BALAN: We don't all have your childish curiosity, Cully. 
CULLY: You'd have more fun out of life if you did. 
TEEL: The power units of the travel capsule are charging now. 
CULLY: You ever travelled in a capsule before? 
ZOE: I can't say that I have. How do they work? 
CULLY: Don't know. Can't stand the things myself. Hey, you asked a question. 
ZOE: Yes. 
CULLY: There you go, Balan, that proves it. This girl's got an enquiring mind. She can't possibly come from Dulkis. 
BALAN: That will be for your father to decide. As soon as your friends return they will follow you and Cully in the second capsule. 
ZOE: Wouldn't it be better if all four of us went together? 
KANDO: Travel capsules only take two. 
TEEL: Number one ready. 
KANDO: It's nothing to be afraid of, you know. 
ZOE: Oh, I'm not frightened. I'm looking forward to it. 
CULLY: Come on, let's try and stir up a little action in the Capital. 
KANDO: You really mustn't believe Cully's wild tales. 
(A wall panel opens to reveal two padded seats. Cully and Zoe enter and sit.) 
BALAN: I will dial for the Capital, Cully, if you don't mind. 
CULLY: I see. Frightened I might disappear, eh? 
BALAN: Well, it has been known, hasn't it, Cully. 
CULLY: It'd be a joke if it happened this time though, wouldn't it? 
(Balan closes the door and the windowless bullet with fins hurtles off through the air.)

[Capsule]

CULLY: The selector's a bit warm. Soon reach the ceiling. It'll be all right when we level off. There you are. Sit back and relax. Won't take long. 
ZOE: Does this land on automatic control as well? 
CULLY: Oh yes, the whole thing's automatic. Dial where you want to go and in less than eight minutes you're there.

[Saucer]

JAMIE: Look, how long are you going to keep us like this? 
TOBA: Silence! 
JAMIE: Oh, if I could only get away from this wall. 
DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie. I am trying to listen. 
JAMIE: Oh, everyone wants me to shut up. All right, I will. 
RAGO: And if we are to use these Dulcians as slaves there are certain qualities you must look for. Obedience, strength, sufficient intelligence to make them of use, but not so much as to make them dangerous. Is that clear? 
TOBA: Yes. 
JAMIE: Er, what are they saying? 
DOCTOR: I think they're arranging for some sort of tests. 
JAMIE: Tests? What for? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. I thought I heard them mention the word intelligence. 
JAMIE: Oh, you mean they're going to find out how clever we are? 
DOCTOR: Yes. Or how stupid. I wonder which is the more important to them?

[Capsule]

ZOE: Will it take long to reach the Capital? 
CULLY: Reach it? We're there. Door to door service.

[Council chamber]

(Through the picture window we can see travel capsule tubes. There are large bromeliads in pots for decoration. The Council meets lounging in easy chairs. They are all older men in long dresses.) 
BOVEM: Very well, then. It is agreed that the area in question be converted for holiday and relaxation purposes. This is now agreed? Subject of course to the approval of Director Senex. 
COUNCILLOR 1: Oh I'm sure the Director will approve our decision. After all, he considers the Caves of Arick 
COUNCILLOR 2: Has he sufficiently considered the case of the residents 
BOVEM: Really, gentlemen, we've debated this matter for several months. I don't wish to hurry you, indeed, but at least. 
(Intercom chime.) 
BOVEM: Yes, what is it? 
SECRETARY [OC]: Cully has arrived with a stranger. They're here in the antechamber. 
BOVEM: Ah yes. Well, you'd better keep them out there. Has the Director been informed? 
SECRETARY [OC]: Not yet. 
CULLY [OC]: I will not stay here. I'm going in. I want to see my father. 
BOVEM: What is going on out there? 
(Cully and Zoe enter.) 
CULLY: If you think that I'm going to stay out there for hours on end kicking my heels, you're very much mistaken, Bovem! 
BOVEM: Will you tell the Director his son has arrived? 
SECRETARY [OC]: Yes, of course. 
BOVEM: You realise, of course, that you've interrupted a most important meeting. 
CULLY: Not nearly as important as the news I've got. 
BOVEM: Oh really? And what adventure have you dreamt up for us this time? Who is this young person? 
CULLY: Zoe. I met her on the island with two of her friends. They're coming on later. 
BOVEM: Oh, I see. Doubtless none of you had permits? 
CULLY: Oh, don't be stupid, man. How could they have permits? They've come from another planet! 
COUNCILLOR 1: Oh, nonsense. The existence of life on another planet was conclusively disproved! 
COUNCILLOR TWO: Oh, come now 
COUNCILLOR 1: By scientific. 
COUNCILLOR 2: It is perfectly possible that life does exist. 
CULLY: Look, there's no time for the usual Dulcian debate. Don't you realise what's happened? 
BOVEM: And what's that? 
CULLY: A space vehicle has landed. 
COUNCILLOR 2: A space vehicle? 
COUNCILLOR 1: Ridiculous! 
BOVEM: Oh really, Cully. You're wasting this Council's valuable time with these ridiculous stories. Just because you're the Director's son, does not mean 
CULLY: Hello, Father. 
(Everyone stands.) 
BOVEM: I'm sorry, Director Senex. I was not aware that 
SENEX: So I observed. I think it would be better if I speak to Cully and the young lady alone. 
BOVEM: Of course, yes. 
SENEX: Well, wait in the antechamber. 
COUNCILLOR 1: I told you the commission specifically stated that there was no life on other planets than this! 
(Bovem and the Councillors leave.) 
CULLY: Look father, I 
SENEX: Cully, do you enjoy being treated like a clown? Your name? 
ZOE: Zoe. 
SENEX: Well then, Zoe, what were you doing on the island? 
ZOE: Nothing, really. Just looking around. 
SENEX: But didn't you know it was dangerous? 
ZOE: No. At least, not at first. 
SENEX: Oh, Cully. How can your conscience allow you to expose innocent and foolish people to such dangers? 
CULLY: But I didn't take her to the island. 
SENEX: Oh ho, nonsense. I know all about Cully's Adventures Unlimited. 
CULLY: You know? But why didn't you 
SENEX: Well, you weren't doing any harm. At least we thought you weren't. 
CULLY: But it's illegal. 
SENEX: But to prosecute would have given you open publicity, and it wouldn't have reflected very well on me either. 
CULLY: I see. Why can't I be treated as an individual and not always as the son of the Director? 
SENEX: Now then, young lady. Tell me exactly what happened. 
ZOE: Well, I landed with the Doctor and Jamie 
SENEX: In Cully's ship, yes? 
ZOE: Cully? Oh, no. We came in the Tardis. 
SENEX: What is that? 
ZOE: It's an advanced craft for travel. 
CULLY: It goes through time and space. 
SENEX: I think this joke has gone far enough. 
CULLY: There you are. I knew he wouldn't believe it. 
ZOE: But it's true! You can ask the Doctor and Jamie. They'll be here soon. 
SENEX: What do you hope to gain by this foolishness? 
CULLY: But it's not. I told you when we spoke on the vision link. Three people have been killed, a spacecraft has landed, radioactivity has disappeared, and there are robots on that island. Now I may have a pretty inventive mind, but I wouldn't have dreamt up that lot, now would I? 
SENEX: And no doubt you will confirm all this? 
CULLY: Er, well, I haven't actually seen the spacecraft and robots. 
SENEX: Oh! So it seems we only have your word for it, Cully. And experience has taught us how little that can be relied upon.

[Saucer]

JAMIE: What's he up to now? 
DOCTOR: He's arranging some sort of intelligence test, Jamie. 
JAMIE: You mean those wee shapes in that big box? What for? 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, you have to put the right shapes into the correct holes. It's quite simple. 
JAMIE: Och, if that's all it is, a kid of two could do it. 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what's bothering me. It's too simple. 
(The Doctor scratches his nose.) 
JAMIE: You moved. 
DOCTOR: I'm free. What about you? 
JAMIE: Me too. 
DOCTOR: Come on. 
(The Doctor and Jamie start to slide to their right but the Quark bleeps.) 
TOBA: Well? 
QUARK: Molecular force expended. Order required. Are the specimens to be re-fused? 
TOBA: No. 
DOCTOR: What are you going to do with us? 
TOBA: Quiet! Over there. 
(The Doctor goes to the test box.) 
TOBA: Sit! 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. 
TOBA: Attach force units. 
(A Quark fastens its arms to the box.) 
TOBA: Hands! Through there. 
(The Doctor puts his arms through holes into the box.) 
TOBA: Power. 
(The Doctor gets an electric shock.) 
TOBA: That will be repeated again at regular intervals until the puzzle is reassembled. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh no! 
TOBA: Begin! 
JAMIE: Hurry up, Doctor. 
(The Doctor fumbles with the shapes and gets another shock.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, my hands! 
JAMIE: No, the square bit, not the star. The square bit 
(Another shock.) 
TOBA: Detach. 
(The Quark moves back and Toba pulls the Doctor's hands from the box. Jamie comes to help.) 
JAMIE: Doctor! Doctor. Now where's that? 
(Jamie takes a bottle of smelling salts from the Doctor's pocket.) 
JAMIE: Here. Quick. Sniff, sniff. That's it. Come away. Come away from that fearful contraption. Are you all right? 
(Out of Toba's hearing.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm all right. 
JAMIE: What were you up to? That puzzle was easy! 
DOCTOR: An unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
DOCTOR: Just act stupid. Do you think you can manage that? 
JAMIE: Oh aye, it's easy. 
TOBA: Attach force units. 
(The Quarks fasten themselves to the metal rails of the dais.) 
TOBA: You two over here. Sit. 
JAMIE: Oh, thank you. 
DOCTOR: Oh. 
(Jamie and the Doctor sit on the edge of the dais, feet off the floor.) 
TOBA: Power. Now, get up. 
(The Doctor puts a foot down and gets an electric shock.) 
TOBA: I said, get up! 
DOCTOR: Oh, but 
(Jamie puts his foot down, creating a circuit, then grabs the Doctor's arm to pass the shock onto him before letting go again.) 
JAMIE: Try around here. 
TOBA: You are surrounded. 
JAMIE: Well how do we get off? 
TOBA: There is a way. Find it! 
(Rago enters.) 
RAGO: Test complete? 
TOBA: These creatures are useless. 
RAGO: Strange. 
TOBA: You question my report, Navigator Rago? 
RAGO: I find it at variance with what we already know. 
TOBA: I don't understand. 
RAGO: The weapons we saw earlier. Could they have been devised by such apparent simpletons? 
TOBA: You think that there were other 
RAGO: That we will find out. Message to Fleet Leader. Materials readily accessible. Fleet proceed to refuel. Investigating potential slave labour. Transmit! 
(A Quark beeps.) 
RAGO: Come with me. 
DOCTOR: But every time we try and get up, there's a 
RAGO: Jump! 
DOCTOR: Jump? Jump. 
(The Doctor and Jamie climb up onto the dais, hold hands then jump forward past where the Quarks were standing.) 
RAGO: A simple circuit completed by your bodies. You obviously know little of electricity. 
DOCTOR: Elec? Elec? 
RAGO: Are you such a fool? You have intelligent eyes. I will continue the test personally. Bring! 
(The Quark sticks out its arms.) 
DOCTOR: All right, we'll go.

[Survey unit]

KANDO: The strangers are a long time returning, Balan. 
BALAN: Yes. Doubtless searching the whole island in search of something which doesn't exist. Teel, have you finished that graph? 
TEEL: Yes, sir. 
BALAN: Show it me, please. 
TEEL: Well, it doesn't seem logical somehow, sir. We all know that there's been a steady uniform decrease in radiation during the past hundred and seventy two years, and suddenly it all disappears. 
BALAN: Well it has happened, therefore it is a fact. We now know that the effects of an atomic explosion lasts for a hundred and seventy two years. 
TEEL: But why, sir? 
BALAN: Oh, I dare say our atomic experts could provide a reason, but it seems pointless to spend time searching for reasons to prove facts. A fact is a truth. 
KANDO: But the spacecraft that Cully saw? 
BALAN: Oh, there is no such spacecraft, nor are there any robots.

[Museum]

RAGO: I said, what is that? 
DOCTOR: Well. Well, it's some sort of gun, isn't it? 
(The Doctor picks up the laser rifle.) 
RAGO: Explain it to me. 
DOCTOR: Well, I don't know that I 
RAGO: Firepower potential? 
DOCTOR: Hmm? 
RAGO: What does it do? 
DOCTOR: Oh, oh, I see. Well, guns kill people. Is that what you wanted to know? 
RAGO: Fire it. 
DOCTOR: Well, I don't think I. You have to put something into it first, And it comes out here, as far as I remember. 
(Rago hands the rifle to Jamie.) 
RAGO: You. Fire it. 
JAMIE: Oh, I wouldn't know how it works. 
TOBA: Do as Dominator Rago says! Fire it! 
JAMIE: Well I'll try. Er, you put a cork or something in there and something 
(The rifle is pointing at the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie. Jamie, be careful. 
JAMIE: Oh, I'll get the hang of it, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, be careful! 
DOCTOR: We don't understand guns on Dulkis! We haven't used them for hundreds of years! 
(Rago takes the rifle.) 
RAGO: So, you don't understand guns. 
(Rago fires it, just missing the Doctor and blasting a hole in the wall behind him.) 
RAGO: Are you sure? 
DOCTOR: Yes! It was the Clever Ones who invented them! 
RAGO: Clever Ones? 
DOCTOR: Yes! They lived long ago, you see. There aren't many of them left. They stopped us using guns and things. 
RAGO: There are two distinct types on this planet? 
DOCTOR: Yes! 
RAGO: How many of these Clever Ones are there? 
DOCTOR: Well, there are, there are not many. We don't like them much. They tell us what to do, you see. 
RAGO: Good. I see. 
(Rago puts the rifle back on its display stand.) 
RAGO: There is nothing to fear from these primitives and the others sound as if they're pacifists. 
TOBA: So they are useless. 
RAGO: They have a small labour potential, nothing more. 
TOBA: Shall I destroy them? 
RAGO: No, we must conserve power. 
TOBA: But why 
RAGO: We have nothing to fear from such creatures. It would be a waste of energy to destroy them. Leave them! Stay away from us and the Quarks. DOCTOR: Oh yes, sir. 
JAMIE: Yes, Master. 
(Rago, Toba and the Quarks leave.) 
JAMIE: Am I glad that's over. 
DOCTOR: Me, too. They're a bloodthirsty lot these Dominators, aren't they? 
JAMIE: Aye. What do you think they're after? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. That message they sent. Material readily accessible. Some sort of mineral deposits, do you think? 
JAMIE: And then this fleet of theirs would refuel, land and pick it up. It makes sense. 
DOCTOR: Well, what do they want the Dulcians as slaves for? They've got the Quarks. 
JAMIE: Aye, nasty little beasties. Hey, Doctor, they've gone. We'd better get back to that survey place. Zoe'll be wondering what's happening. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think you're right.

[Council chamber]

CULLY: I've got to make them believe me before it's too late. 
ZOE: Well, what are you going to do? 
CULLY: Get some evidence. Will you come back to the island with me? 
ZOE: All right. But how do we get past the Council out there? 
CULLY: Through my father's rooms. Come on. We'll have to steal a travel capsule somehow. Well, I can manage that all right but er 
ZOE: Well, what's the matter? 
CULLY: Your clothes. Not exactly Dulcian, are they? 
ZOE: So? 
CULLY: They'll attract too much attention. We'd never get past the capsule managers. Still, no problem. We can always fix you up with some Dulcian garments. 
ZOE: Where from? 
CULLY: Clothing dispenser unit. There's one in my father's rooms, come on.

[Survey unit]

(Another capsule is waiting for its passengers.) 
BALAN: This will take you direct to the Capital, Doctor. Your young friend Zoe is already there. No doubt Director Senex is awaiting your arrival. 
DOCTOR: Oh, this is splendid! 
JAMIE: Look, Doctor, what is this? You know I hate being cooped up. 
(The door slides shut.) 
BALAN: Now perhaps we can get on with our work. 
KANDO: What are you thinking? 
TEEL: They seem so positive that they'd seen robots. 
KANDO: I almost believed them. 
TEEL: Balan, we may be in great danger. Would it not be wise to check for ourselves? 
BALAN: I can see I shall get no work from you two until you have got positive proof. Come along.

[Council chamber]

CULLY: Hey, come on. Nearly ready? 
ZOE: Yes, just about. 
(Zoe enters in the female Dulcian outfit of one piece body and gauze skirt, and flat sandals.) 
CULLY: Good. 
ZOE: I'm not sure I pressed the right button. 
CULLY: Why not? It's not bad, even for an automatic machine. 
ZOE: Well, they're not very efficient garments, are they. 
CULLY: Well, at least you look more like a girl now. 
ZOE: Oh I'm not sure. They feel impractical. 
CULLY: Never mind. The main thing is that now you'll pass as a Dulcian. Let's go and get a capsule.

[Saucer]

RAGO: Drill depth on fourth bore? 
TOBA: Eighteen thousand. 
RAGO: Link feeds to your seismographic readings. Inform explosive force. Enquire time and depth. Feed into calculator now. 
TOBA: Command accepted. 
QUARK: Unknown creatures approaching. 
(Balan, Kando and Teel are on a video screen.) 
TOBA: Destroy? 
RAGO: No, investigate.

[Outside the saucer]

KANDO: It's enormous! 
TEEL: So Cully was telling the truth. 
BALAN: Was he? 
KANDO: But, Balan. 
BALAN: Where are the robots? 
KANDO: Inside, perhaps.

[Saucer]

KANDO [on monitor]: Oh please may we go in? 
BALAN [on monitor]: Oh very well. 
(Teel, Kando and Balan enter.) 
KANDO: But it's empty. 
(They walk past a Quark.) 
BALAN: Look, there's a map of the island. 
QUARK: Stand still. 
(Rago and Toba appear from nowhere.) 
BALAN: But, you are not Dulcians! 
(The Quark beeps, and Balan is sucked onto the dais, face down.) 
BALAN: I can't move! 
KANDO: Oh, what have they done? 
RAGO: Stand quite still! (to Teel) You. Move over there. Activate. 
(Teel is stuck to the wall. Kando screams.) 
RAGO: Silence. Toba? 
(Teel's wall becomes an examination table.) 
TOBA: Attach force units. 
RAGO: These look different. Visor. 
BALAN: Leave that boy alone! 
KANDO: What do you want from us? 
TOBA: Silence! 
RAGO: As I thought, they are different. Greater brain power, two hearts. There are two distinct species on this planet. 
TOBA: Dangerous? 
RAGO: No. 
TOBA: Then we might have the labour force we need after all. 
RAGO: Yes, if there are more on the island. We will search.

[Capsule]

ZOE: Well, what's funny? 
CULLY: I just thought. Your friends are probably on their way back to the Capital. We'll have passed them going the other way. 
ZOE: I hope not. 
CULLY: Oh, it doesn't make much difference. We can always turn around again. As long as those robots don't appear. 
(The Dominators are searching the island using three Quarks. They split up.) 
CULLY: Hold on. Deceleration. Another minute or so and we'll land safely at the survey unit.

[Survey unit]

TOBA: Record all technical data. 
(The Quarks pirouette.) 
QUARK: Scan completed. 
TOBA: Good! Follow.

[Island]

TOBA: Recharge. 
(Two Quarks open and close their arms.)

[Survey unit]

(The capsule has arrived. Cully gets out.) 
ZOE: Where do you think everybody is? 
CULLY: I don't know. Come on, out you get.

[Island]

(Across a valley from the Survey unit.) 
TOBA: Destroy, destroy! 
(Three Quarks open fire. There are explosions at the unit building.)

[Survey unit]

ZOE: Cully, what's happening? 
CULLY: I don't know. 
(A console explodes.) 
CULLY: The door, quick! 
(But the opening mechanism doesn't work.) 
CULLY: It's stuck. It's stuck! We're trapped! 
(There is another big bang. Zoe screams and Cully grabs her as the ceiling starts to fall in.)

Episode Three

[Island]

TOBA: Recharge. Complete destruction! 
RAGO: Toba! 
(Rago and a Quark are nearby.) 
RAGO: Quarks, wait. 
[Survey unit]

CULLY: Maybe you'll believe in my robots now. 
ZOE: I don't know about robots, but something was attacking us, and with pretty sophisticated weapons too. 
CULLY: Well whatever it was, we'd better get out of here fast. Let's try and move this door.

[Island]

TOBA: I wanted to prevent their escape. 
RAGO: You wanted to destroy. Unnecessary destruction is wasteful. Did you inspect it? 
TOBA: All relevant details have been recorded. 
RAGO: See if there are any survivors and bring them to me. Alive.

[Survey unit]

ZOE: Oh, it's no good. It's jammed. 
CULLY: Yes, we're trapped in here. 
ZOE: What about the travel capsule? 
CULLY: I can't navigate it. We'll end up back at the Capital. 
ZOE: Well, that's better than being cooked here. 
CULLY: Yes, but they'd pick us off easily in that. Come on let's try that door again. 
(They manage to get the door to slide open a little.) 
CULLY: Come on. Keep it 
(There is a Quark on the other side.) 
CULLY: Now you know I'm not lying!

[Council chamber]

BOVEM: Director Senex asked that you should be brought to the Council chamber immediately. Please wait here.
JAMIE: Just a moment. Er, where's Zoe? 
BOVEM: You mean the girl? 
JAMIE: Yes, Zoe. Is she here? 
BOVEM: No. 
DOCTOR: Well then, where is she? She did arrive safely? 
BOVEM: Oh yes. 
JAMIE: Well then? Hey, has anything happened to her? 
BOVEM: Director Senex will explain, should he think fit. 
JAMIE: Hey, just 
BOVEM: There is no cause for alarm. I will inform the Director of your arrival. 
(Bovem leaves.) 
JAMIE: What do you think's happened to her, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I've no idea, Jamie. But the Dulcians wouldn't have harmed her, of that I'm certain. 
JAMIE: Aye.

[Saucer]

KANDO: Are you all right, Balan? 
BALAN: Oh, yes, but I don't understand what is happening. Why should these people wish us harm? 
RAGO: Silence! 
TOBA: The other two specimens for examination. Shall I bring them in? 
RAGO: Wait. Observe the cerebral cortex development in this specimen. 
KANDO: Oh please, don't hurt him. 
BALAN: If only you would tell us what you wanted. 
RAGO: I said, silence. Well? 
TOBA: Higher potential than the first two. Not a very resourceful brain pattern, but intelligent. 
RAGO: Yes. I will send this information to Fleet Leader for analysis. It is possible these creatures may be used for slave labour. Unfortunately their muscular development seems somewhat limited. 
TOBA: Then they're of no use? 
RAGO: We shall test them. Put them to work on the drilling site. Observe how long they survive. 
TOBA: Command accepted. 
RAGO: And send a Quark back to the unit. Should any more arrive, I want them alive.

[Council chamber]

(All the Council members are here now.) 
SENEX: As far as we know, she left with my son Cully. Presumably they have returned to the island. 
DOCTOR: What? 
JAMIE: Oh, no. Why'd you not tell us? Come on, Doctor. 
SENEX: I do not think that would be advisable. 
JAMIE: Oh, you mean we're prisoners again? 
SENEX: No. There are no prisoners on Dulkis. 
DOCTOR: It's not necessary, you see, Jamie. This is a society of total pacifism. 
JAMIE: You mean they don't fight? They don't have any armies? 
DOCTOR: No, no. 
JAMIE: Oh, that's just great! How then are we going to drive off those Quark things? 
SENEX: From your reaction and your lack of knowledge of the way of life on Dulkis, it would seem there was some truth in your story that you are from another planet. 
JAMIE: Of course there's some truth. Look, it was your people who thought we were friends of Cully's. 
SENEX: The identity of my son's companions can now been established, although what has happened to them is not quite clear. 
DOCTOR: But Cully has told you. They were murdered. And I believe him! 
SENEX: Why? 
DOCTOR: Because I have seen these Dominators. We were taken aboard their spacecraft. Believe me, they're callous. Without pity. 
(General consternation.) 
SENEX: I would be grateful if you could tell me what occurred on the island. 
JAMIE: Och look here, we've told you. We're just wasting time talking while Zoe's in danger.

[Outside the museum]

(Zoe and Cully are resting on a large rock while Quarks stand guard.) 
ZOE: Can't we get away? 
CULLY: Oh, we wouldn't stand a chance. These Quarks are deadly. 
ZOE: Any idea how they're powered? 
CULLY: No, why? 
ZOE: Well if we knew we might be able to put them out of action. 
CULLY: Attack them? Are you out of your mind? 
ZOE: Well, they're only robots. 
CULLY: Only? Do you really think we could destroy one? 
ZOE: It'd be easier if we had a gun of some. The laser gun! 
CULLY: Eh? 
ZOE: Cully, I think we stand a chance.

[Saucer]

TOBA: Take them to the others. 
QUARK: Move. 
(Belen, Teel and Kando leave with a Quark.) 
TOBA: I'll sent them to work on the drilling site. 
RAGO: Work potential and stamina to be recorded and sent for analysis. 
TOBA: Agreed. If any of them should escape 
RAGO: Then you will report the fact to me. No personal action. Toba! 
TOBA: Command accepted.

[Outside the museum]

ZOE: So the Doctor and Jamie are on the mainland? 
CULLY: Yes. It looks as though from now on we're on our own. 
TOBA: You creatures, follow.

[Council chamber]

DOCTOR: And when these horrible tests were over, they just let us go. 
SENEX: Did you discover for what purpose these tests were carried out? 
JAMIE: Yes, to see if we were intelligent enough to use as slaves. 
BOVEM: Evidently you were not. 
DOCTOR: I would like to make a suggestion. I know it is the way of Dulkis to discuss and to deliberate, but the situation is urgent. Send someone to the island to confirm what we've told you. 
JAMIE: Yes, and while they're away we can be thinking out some plan to tackle those Dominators. 
SENEX: These Dominators. They let you go free, why should we fear them? 
DOCTOR: Because they are aggressive, callous and unfeeling. Don't expect them to act and think as you do. They're alien, from another world. 
SENEX: Well so are you, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear, you've got me there. 
JAMIE: Oh, for heavens sake! Look, are you going to send someone to that island or are you not? 
SENEX: Patience, young man. Doctor, what in your opinion do this Dominators want? 
DOCTOR: Well I'm not sure, but I heard them say that the material was readily accessible. Probably some kind of mineral ore. 
SENEX: Oh, there are no valuable minerals here. They are welcome to whatever they can find. There is no cause for alarm. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but then there's the matter of the disappearance of the radioactivity from the island. That could be significant. 
SENEX: Why seek menace where there may be none? 
JAMIE: But you can't just sit here and do nothing. 
BOVEM: Why not? 
COUNCILLOR 1: Haste is not in the Dulcian tradition. 
COUNCILLOR 2: Better to do nothing than do the wrong thing. 
JAMIE: Oh you're mad, the lot of you. 
BOVEM: What would you suggest we do? 
JAMIE: Well for a start, send an armed party over there to rescue Zoe and your people. 
BOVEM: An armed party? 
JAMIE: Yes! 
COUNCILLOR 1: But the use of arms on Dulkis is totally unprecedented. 
COUNCILLOR 2: Not totally unprecedented. In the earliest days of our history we 
COUNCILLOR 1: Oh, in primitive times perhaps, but impossible to consider today. 
COUNCILLOR 2: Oh yes, of course. 
JAMIE: What are they talking about? 
DOCTOR: I told you, Jamie. There are no weapons on Dulkis. 
SENEX: For centuries we have lived in peace. We have proved that universal gentleness will cause aggression to die. 
JAMIE: Aye, well, the Dominators don't know anything about your gentleness. 
DOCTOR: Jamie has a point there, you know. Now I suggest you try to get in touch with Balan on the island again. He must know more by now. 
SENEX: Oh, very well. 
DOCTOR: Ah. 
JAMIE: Eh? (A view of the inside of the survey unit comes up on a monitor.) 
JAMIE: Hey, would you look at that. 
SENEX: Balan? Balan, are you there? 
(The view pans around to - ) 
DOCTOR: It's no use! 
JAMIE: Look! 
DOCTOR: It's too late! 
BOVEM: What is that? 
DOCTOR: It's a robot! 
JAMIE: That's a Quark! Now come on, we've wasted enough time. 
DOCTOR: Yes! Now perhaps you'll believe me.

[Capsule]

(The Doctor finishes off a bag of sweets.) 
DOCTOR: Now, Jamie, what did you want to tell me? 
JAMIE: Well, I suppose you know what you're doing. 
DOCTOR: What do you mean? 
JAMIE: Well, this contraption's homing back on that survey place, right? 
DOCTOR: Yes, right. 
JAMIE: Well, there's a Quark there waiting for us!

[Outside the museum]

TOBA: If these tests prove favourable some of you may be among those chosen to serve the Dominators. 
ZOE: As slaves, you mean? 
TOBA: Don't ever interrupt me again. To serve the Dominators, Masters of the Ten Galaxies. Your progress here will be reported. 
CULLY: Progress at what? 
TOBA: This area here is to be cleared of debris and rubble. 
ZOE: Why? 
TOBA: Because I command it. 
ZOE: I am not going to work unless I know why you want 
TOBA: Quiet! Very well. This site is to be cleared for drilling, firstly because we want it cleared, secondly to find out whether you have enough strength to make a work force. 
ZOE: And if we haven't? 
TOBA: You will all be destroyed. So remember, you are working for your lives. 
(Toba walks away.) 
BALAN: We must, for now. 
(Balan picks up a rock and carries it away.) 
ZOE: I wonder why they want to drill here? 
CULLY: Who cares what they want. What are we going to do? 
ZOE: We've got to get away. 
CULLY: Yes, but how? 
ZOE: Well, there's only two Quarks. There's five of us. 
BALAN: Escape is pointless. Where would we go? 
KANDO: We can't get off the island. 
TEEL: Perhaps the Capital will send help. 
CULLY: Help? But what can they do? They're just not equipped to deal with this sort of thing. No, we've got to get out of this mess ourselves. 
ZOE: And that's just what I mean to do. Cully, how fast can these Quarks move? 
BALAN: Young lady, I cannot allow you to incite my pupils. Resistance will only lead to violence. 
ZOE: And submission leads to slavery. We must fight. How about you, Cully? 
CULLY: You can count me in. Kando? 
KANDO: No. Balan is right. Violence is always met with violence. 
CULLY: Teel? 
TEEL: I accept what you both say, but I'm afraid I also agree with Zoe and Cully. Meek submission would be humiliating. 
QUARK: Continue working.

[Capsule]

(The Doctor opens up the control panel.) 
JAMIE: Hey, have you gone daft or something? 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie, not exactly. Oh dear, this is rather complicated. 
JAMIE: Hey, you can't just take things to pieces, not when we're flying at heaven knows what speed. 
DOCTOR: Well, Jamie, as you said, this capsule is homing straight back onto the survey unit, and the Quarks are there. 
JAMIE: Well, I did try to warn you. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. Thank you. Now don't worry. All I've got to do is to override the automatic pilot. 
JAMIE: Oh. Hey, are there not any ordinary controls for flying this thing? 
DOCTOR: Ah, no, no, Jamie, there don't seem to be. But the simplest way is to get straight at the control mechanism. 
JAMIE: The simplest? 
DOCTOR: Yes, now it's all right, Jamie, just leave it all to me. The trouble is all the wires seem to be leading up into the nose. Just hold this for me for a minute, will you Jamie? Let's see whether I can scramble through here. Just wait a minute. we're nearly there. Oh! 
(The Doctor tumbles into the nose cone of the capsule leaving his legs waving in the air.)

[Saucer]

TOBA: Ready for transmission. 
RAGO: Transmit course and point of deviation to Fleet Leader. 
TOBA: Command accepted. 
RAGO: Yes? 
QUARK: Initial report. 
RAGO: Continue. 
QUARK: All prisoners except one showing signs of fatigue. 
TOBA: That will be the young man. 
QUARK: Correction, Dominator. It is a female that shows the less fatigue. 
RAGO: Interesting. 
TOBA: Shall I liven them up? 
RAGO: No. Work them to the point of exhaustion, note their time of collapse, then bring them to me.

[Outside the museum]

(Zoe is still carrying rocks while the others are barely moving. Cully helps her put it down.) 
CULLY: If we don't get a move on the others will be too tired to even attempt an escape. Have you got any ideas? 
ZOE: Well, we'll have to put that Quark out of action for a start or we won't stand a chance. 
CULLY: Yes, but how? 
ZOE: Well, there's a laser gun in that museum place. Somehow we've got to get hold of it. 
(Balan collapses.) 
BALAN: I'm sorry. 
KANDO: Don't worry. 
QUARK: Continue working. 
ZOE: He can't! He's exhausted! 
QUARK: Continue working. 
CULLY: You stupid tin box, can't you see he's worn out? 
QUARK: Is this specimen broken? 
CULLY: Yes. 
QUARK: Place it on one side. Remainder continue working. 
(They carry Balan to a place by the building.) 
KANDO: There. I'm sorry. We're not used to manual labour on Dulkis. 
(The Dulcians carry rocks away from the building, leaving Zoe alone. Cully nods to Zoe when the Quark is looking the other way and she enters the Museum. Unfortunately there is another Quark inside so she has to leave again.)

[Capsule]

(Jamie tries to hang on to the Doctor's waving feet.) 
JAMIE: Hey, what are you doing in there? 
DOCTOR: I've nearly got it, Jamie. Yes, I think I've got it. 
JAMIE: You think? You mean you're not sure? 
DOCTOR: Well, there won't be time for another try, you know. Oh, give us a hand. Pull me back. 
(Jamie pulls the Doctor out of the nose cone.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, there we are, yes. Yes, I think I've done it. Now then, hold on and I'm going to try and steer this thing. 
JAMIE: With that mess of wires? 
(The capsule veers down and left.) 
JAMIE: Take it easy. 
DOCTOR: Well, at least we know it works, don't we. 
JAMIE: Hey, can you land the thing? 
DOCTOR: Of course I can. I'll get us down in no time at all. 
JAMIE: Aye, but in one piece? 
DOCTOR: Now just hold on.

[Council chamber]

COUNCILLOR 2: Perhaps we should do something? We must be 
BOVEM: Gentlemen, gentlemen, this is no matter for precipitate action. 
SENEX: Nevertheless, we must hope that the Doctor may be able to pursue some useful course of action. 
BOVEM: With respect, Director, I am reluctant to rely on the assistance of any alien. 
SENEX: You do now admit that he is not a Dulcian? 
BOVEM: Yes, so I think that our alliance must be placed in the Chairman of Emergencies Committee. 
SENEX: Chairman Tensa? Yes, he is able, but can he deal with this crisis? 
BOVEM: Oh, sir, Tensa has proved his efficiency in the face of fires, droughts, earthquakes. 
SENEX: All natural disasters. All created by forces not inherently acting from aggressive motives. 
(Intercom chimes.) 
SENEX: Yes? 
SECRETARY [OC]: Chairman Tensa is here. Presents his compliments. 
SENEX: Send him in immediately. 
COUNCILLOR 1: He's a very able man. 
(Tensa enters.) 
TENSA: My greetings, Director Senex. Gentlemen. 
SENEX: Tensa, you have been informed of the emergency that has arisen? 
TENSA: Yes. 
SENEX: What would you advise? 
TENSA: The facts of this emergency are non-conclusive. 
(Murmurs of agreement.) 
TENSA: But, as I see it, we have three alternatives. 
SENEX: Which are? 
TENSA: If these aliens and their robots are aggressive, and as yet this is not a fact. But if they are, then we can either fight 
COUNCILLOR 1: Fight? 
BOVEM: Fight? 
SENEX: Silence! Tensa. 
TENSA: Fight, submit or flee. 
BOVEM: Flee to where? 
SENEX: We cannot make war. We are not able. Flight is impossible, we have nowhere to hide. And submission? To what? 
TENSA: Who knows? 
SENEX: So we can do nothing? 
TENSA: Nothing, except wait.

[Island]

(The capsule has buried its nose into a sand dune. The door opens to reveal the Doctor and Jamie in a tangle of wires. They clamber out.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, no bones broken. Oh dear. Oh, there we are. Oh, my word, Ah. Well, I think we've done rather well so far, don't you? 
JAMIE: More by luck than by judgement, if you ask me. What a landing. 
DOCTOR: It was just a bit bumpy. Oh now then, the main thing is we weren't spotted. Now come along, we've got to find Zoe and the others. 
JAMIE: Aye.

[Outside the museum]

(Teel and Cully carry a big rock between them.) 
TEEL: All right then, I'm with you, but do you think it'll work? 
CULLY: Of course it will. Once we can get hold of the laser and flatten these Quarks, and go to ground somewhere. 
TEEL: But where? It mustn't be far. I mean, look at Kando. 
ZOE: Yes, and Balan. Is there anywhere near here to hide? 
TEEL: Wait a minute. The shelter. The bomb shelter. I'm sure they built one here somewhere. Part of the atom test. 
ZOE: It sounds ideal. Where is it? 
TEEL: Can't remember.

[Island hilltop]

JAMIE: Hey, would you look down there. 
DOCTOR: It's the ruined building. Hello. 
(The Doctor takes out his pocket telescope.) 
JAMIE: What can you see? 
(Jamie takes it from him before he gets a chance to look.) 
JAMIE: It's Zoe and Cully! 
DOCTOR: We've got to get down there. Jamie, we'll split up and get around the back of them. I'll cut across those cliffs. 
JAMIE: I'll go this way.

[Outside the museum]

ZOE: You ready? 
CULLY: Yes. 
ZOE: Once you're inside give me time to get the two Quarks into your line of fire. 
CULLY: Here we go. 
(Cully goes to a rock, starts to lift it and then collapses.) 
QUARK: Next one collapsed. Join the other specimens. 
(Cully staggers over to Balan, Kando and Teel next to the building.) 
BALAN: This is foolishness, Cully. 
TEEL: All clear. Best of luck. 
(Cully goes into the museum and takes the laser rifle from its stand, then crouches by a window. Zoe picks up a rock, looks over her shoulder to see if he is in position, then collapses. The rifle sights are on a Quark's head.) 
QUARK: All specimens have reached point of collapse. 
ZOE: Fire, Cully, fire.

[Museum]

(Cully has a Quark lined up when someone grabs his shoulder.) 
JAMIE: What do you think you're doing? 
CULLY: Jamie! 
JAMIE: Zoe's out there. 
CULLY: I know that, you fool, I was aiming at those Quarks! 
QUARK [OC]: All specimens stand up. 
CULLY: I missed my chance. I had them in my sights.

[Outside the museum]

TEEL: Why didn't he shoot? 
KANDO: I don't know. 
QUARK: Specimens must all be returned to Dominator Rago. 
QUARK 2: One of them is missing. It is the specimen Cully.

[Museum]

CULLY: Oh, it's no good. Balan's in the way now. 
JAMIE: Well, I said I'm sorry. Anyway I don't think we should do anything until the Doctor gets here. 
CULLY: Well he'd better be quick. Those Dominators will be after me soon. 
JAMIE: Don't worry. He'll get here.

[Island]

(The Doctor looks out from behind a rock to see - ) 
TOBA: What are you doing? You were told to keep away from the Quarks. 
DOCTOR: Oh, but I do. Whenever I see one I go away. But they're all over the island. Where can I go? 
(Three Quarks are escorting Zoe, Teel, Kando and Balan along a path.) 
TOBA: Stop. One of them's missing. 
QUARK: The man Cully has escaped. 
TOBA: Has he. All right, carry on. Take this idiot with you. Quark, follow me. 
(Now with an escort of three Quarks, Toba goes back along the path.)

[Museum]

CULLY: It's no good, Jamie. We daren't wait any longer. Something must have happened to the Doctor. 
JAMIE: Aye, I think you're right. 
TOBA [OC]: Cully! 
JAMIE: Down! I told you to stay away from the window. 
CULLY: Do you think he saw me? 
TOBA [OC]: I know you're in there, Cully! 
JAMIE: Give me that. 
(Jamie takes the laser rifle.)

[Outside the museum]

TOBA: Now you'll see what happens when the orders of a Dominator are disobeyed. Quark, destroy! 
(The Quarks start 'firing' at the building.)

[Museum]

(The museum door blows in and the ceiling starts to come down.) 
JAMIE: Right, here goes. 
(Jamie fires the rifle.)

[Outside the museum]

(A Quark starts spinning with smoke coming out of it, then goes Bang!) 
TOBA: Destroy! Destroy! Total destruction!

[Museum]

JAMIE: I can't see a thing. If only I could get in another shot. 
(A girder lands on Cully. Jamie helps him up.) 
JAMIE: Let's get out of here! 
CULLY: No, this way. 
(They go further into the museum.)

[Outside the museum]

TOBA: Stop. 
QUARK: Work completed.

Episode Four

[Saucer]

(Toba and the Quarks have returned.) 
QUARK: On the orders of Dominator Toba the building was destroyed. Also the man Cully. 
DOCTOR: But Jamie was in that building! 
RAGO: Silence! You deliberately disobeyed my order? 
TOBA: My life was threatened and a Quark destroyed. 
RAGO: Yes, because of your own actions. 
TOBA: Are you suggesting I should have let him escape? 
RAGO: And where would he have gone? We are on an island, Toba. These creatures cannot escape. Now listen to me carefully, and this time you will obey my instructions. Send these creatures back to the central bore position. I want it cleared ready for drilling. 
TOBA: But the Quarks will do it more quickly. 
RAGO: We must conserve their energy for drilling purposes. You know the power levels are low. 
TOBA: Command accepted. Quark, bring the creatures. 
RAGO: Leave the inferior types. 
(A Quark blocks the Doctor and Zoe's path.) RAGO: Toba. 
TOBA: Yes, Navigator Rago? 
RAGO: I have not yet dismissed you. 
TOBA: But the creatures! 
RAGO: Quarks, take these specimens back to the drilling site. Await the arrival of Dominator Toba. You two, over there. 
(The Doctor and Zoe are backed up against a large stellar map wall.) 
DOCTOR: All right, all right. 
TOBA: May I ask what you? 
RAGO: You may ask nothing. You are here to listen. 
TOBA: I am listening. 
RAGO: Probationer Toba, I'm far from satisfied with your conduct on this mission. 
TOBA: I protest! 
RAGO: Be silent! I am beginning to wonder if you have the qualities of intelligence and detachment necessary in a Dominator. 
TOBA: Where have I failed? 
RAGO: You have repeatedly destroyed the creatures and installations of this planet to no purpose. 
TOBA: My purpose was to protect us both. 
RAGO: Protect? These creatures are harmless primitives. You acted out of your desire to gratify a need for pointless destruction. 
TOBA: Was it by softness that the Dominators became Masters of the Ten Galaxies? 
RAGO: It was by ruthlessness, Probationer Toba. That which threatens us we destroy. That which is too weak to harm us we ignore. 
TOBA: Are they so harmless, these primitives? They've disobeyed us, they've attacked us, even here on this small island. The rest of the planet may be preparing to attack us even now. 
RAGO: I will investigate the more advanced type of alien for myself. You will concern yourself with obeying my orders and nothing more. I will report your conduct to Fleet Leader. 
TOBA: And I shall protest at yours. 
RAGO: What did you say? 
TOBA: You've jeopardised our mission by unnecessary softness. You've humiliated me before members of an inferior race. Perhaps it is you who is not fit to be a Dominator. 
RAGO: You have the insolence to threaten me? 
TOBA: It is not unknown for a leader who is unfit to be replaced. 
RAGO: It is not unknown for a mutinous subordinate to be executed. 
TOBA: You would not dare. 
RAGO: Quark! 
QUARK: Yes, sir. 
RAGO: Place Dominator Toba under restraint. 
TOBA: Quark, return to the prisoners. 
(The Quark is confused.) 
RAGO: Quark! I am the senior Dominator, you will obey me! 
(The Quark advances on Toba.) 
RAGO: Well, Toba? Shall I order molecular force, or do you submit? 
TOBA: I submit. 
RAGO: Quark, return to the prisoners. 
ZOE: What was all that about? 
DOCTOR: A little internal dispute I fancy. Oh dear. 
RAGO: You are fortunate that I still have need of your services. You will supervise work on the drilling site and make sure that nothing delays the task. 
TOBA: Command accepted. 
(Toba leaves quickly.) 
RAGO: You two. Here. I have some questions to ask you about your planet. You will be advised to make sure your answers are satisfactory, for your own sakes.

[Outside the museum]

TOBA: You two. Clear the site. Quark, guard them. Old man, follow me. Quark! 
(Toba and Balan leave.) 
QUARK: Obey the Dominator. Clear the site. Work. Work. 
(Kando and Teel move rocks.) 
TEEL: I wonder if Cully made it to the shelter? 
KANDO: They'll almost certainly be dead if they were under that. It looks very quiet. 
(But inside the ruins a piece of rubble moves.)

[Bomb shelter]

(Jamie is trying to push up a periscope to see what is going on.) 
JAMIE: No, no use. I can't see a thing. There must be tons of stuff on top of it, same as the hatch. 
CULLY: Well, we just have to sit and wait until someone comes and digs us out. 
JAMIE: You think they'll find us, then? 
CULLY: Well of course. Balan told me where the this old shelter was, so surely they'll be able to work it out. 
JAMIE: Oh, I wish you'd told us about this place sooner. We could have got down here straight away. 
CULLY: What, and miss exploding that Quark? That was a tremendous shot. 
JAMIE: Aye, maybe so. I just hope the Dominators don't take it out on the others. 
CULLY: I wonder if those Quarks are still hanging about up there? 
JAMIE: Aye. If only we could open that hatch. 
(Jamie climbs the ladder.) 
JAMIE: No, it's no good. Feels as though the whole building's sitting on top of it. 
CULLY: Perhaps it is. 
(Jamie comes down again.) 
JAMIE: Hey. 
CULLY: What's the matter? 
JAMIE: Just been thinking. Have you noticed how stuffy in here it's getting? 
CULLY: Yes, now you mention it. 
JAMIE: Aye, that's the only ventilator shaft I can see and. Hey, if that's blocked we'll suffocate!

[Saucer]

RAGO: And this leader Senex, he is in the Capital city? 
DOCTOR: Well I'm not sure. 
RAGO: Quark, molecular force! 
(Zoe gets stuck to a wall.) 
DOCTOR: No! 
RAGO: I asked you a question. 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, so you did. 
RAGO: Well? 
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, Senex is at the Capital. 
RAGO: These Dulcian travel machines, how do I summon one? 
DOCTOR: Well, you can't. The terminal at the survey unit was destroyed, wasn't it. 
RAGO: Yes. By Toba. Prepare this ship for take off! 
DOCTOR: But, are you going to take your own craft to the Capital? 
RAGO: I have no alternative. 
DOCTOR: Well actually, now I come to think of it, I do know where there is a capsule. I didn't tell you about it before because I'm not sure that it works. It has some loose wires and things, but I'm sure that you'll be able to fix it. 
RAGO: How big is this space machine? Will it transport a Quark? 
DOCTOR: Oh dear, I don't 
RAGO: Then it is useless to our purpose. We will use our own machine. 
DOCTOR: Well actually, now I come to think of it, if you were to take out one of the seats, a Quark might fit inside. 
RAGO: You will show me this machine. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes. 
RAGO: Quark. Prepare to transmit recorded data on work habits of tested specimens. Contact direct Fleet Leader. 
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Zoe. The effect soon wears off. 
ZOE: Why did you tell him about the capsule? 
DOCTOR: Well if he takes this craft we won't be able to investigate it, will we? 
ZOE: But why do you want to? 
DOCTOR: To find out what sort of power unit it has. Then we can tell what the Dominators are looking for on Dulkis. Besides, if they take us to the Capital we won't be able to search for Jamie, will we? 
ZOE: That's true. Hey, wait a minute though. He might be all right if he and Cully 
RAGO: Silence! You will lead me to this travel craft. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
RAGO: Quark, release the female. Follow. 
DOCTOR: There you are, you see? All right. It's all right!

[Drilling site]

TOBA: Enough. Quarks, take up drilling positions. Old man, stand that drill between those Quarks over the drilling site. 
(Balan puts the fancy tripod drill head over the cross.) 
TOBA: Attach force units. 
(The Quarks fasten their arms to the drill.) 
TOBA: Operate. 
(Another Quark enters.) 
TOBA: Quarks, cease drilling. Report. 
QUARK: Orders from Dominator Rago. Probationer Toba to report. 
TOBA: Command accepted. Continue operation. 
(The drilling starts up again in a blaze of light.)

[Beach]

(Rago examines the crashed travel capsule.) 
RAGO: Hmm. A primitive machine, but functional. The circuits need repairing. Minimal task. So, you were telling the truth. 
DOCTOR: Of course. 
RAGO: I'm glad you appreciate that to attempt sabotage would be pointless. 
TOBA: You sent for me. 
RAGO: Yes. I'm going to the alien leader to investigate potential slave force. You will remain here and complete the drilling operations. 
TOBA: Command accepted. You are travelling in this alien machine? 
RAGO: Yes. 
TOBA: Is that wise? It could be dangerous. 
RAGO: I have tested it. It is operable. I will take a Quark for protection. You will command in my absence, but I expect to find the same number of alien specimens on my return. 
TOBA: Command accepted. 
(A few paces away, the Doctor and Zoe are whispering.) 
DOCTOR: Why didn't you tell me about this underground shelter before? 
ZOE: Well, I'm sorry, but I haven't had a chance. Balan told us about it, and with any luck Jamie and Cully might have found their way down there. 
DOCTOR: Well it's possible, it's possible. 
ZOE: And if they have, they should be all right, shouldn't they? 
DOCTOR: Well, I think. 
TOBA: You two. Follow me. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes. All right.

[Bomb shelter]

(Jamie and Cully are using a long metal section of something to try and push the hatch open.) 
CULLY: It's no good, it's stuck again. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
CULLY: What shall we do? 
JAMIE: Look, there's only one thing to do. Try again! Now come on, will you. 
CULLY: Three. 
(They push again and this time a piece of rubble is dislodged from the hatch and it opens.) 
CULLY: We did it! 
JAMIE: Aye. Well, no point in hanging around, hey?

[Museum]

(Jamie puts his head out of the hatchway and looks around.) 
JAMIE: All clear. 
(Jamie climbs out, then hides as he sees a Quark shepherding Kando and Teel carrying a large rock.) 
JAMIE: Oh no, Quarks again. They must be all over the place. Hey, I wonder how many there are? 
CULLY: Why? 
JAMIE: Well the Dominators don't seem much good without them, do they? 
CULLY: So? 
JAMIE: We destroyed one Quark, why not another? 
CULLY: Attack the Quarks? 
JAMIE: Shush! Yes. 
CULLY: But we had a laser gun before. And that's hidden underneath all this lot now. 
JAMIE: There wasn't a laser gun where I come from, yet us McCrimmons still dealt with the Redcoats right enough. 
CULLY: Redcoats? 
JAMIE: Aye, they were. Och, never mind. Look, are you with me? 
CULLY: Well, why not? 
JAMIE: Good. First thing to do is estimate the strength of the enemy. Come on, through there.

[Above a drill site]

(Jamie and Cully peek over a cliff edge.) 
JAMIE: Five so far. Look, you take that side, I'll look around up here. 
(Further on, Jamie slides down a slope to Cully.) 
JAMIE: Sorry, I slipped. How many? 
CULLY: Two more, and you? 
JAMIE: Same here. 
CULLY: Balan's down there with those two. They seem to be doing some sort of drilling. 
JAMIE: Aye, they're drilling in four places. It must be pretty important to the Dominators. 
CULLY: Yes. 
JAMIE: Right, let's start some trouble. 
CULLY: But what can we do? 
JAMIE: Oh I've a wee idea that should just stir them up a bit. Come on.

[Saucer]

TOBA: Report. 
QUARK: Drilling in operation on all perimeter sites. 
TOBA: Is the centre site cleared yet? 
QUARK: Task near completion. 
TOBA: Report progress to Fleet Leader direct. Operations proceeding as planned. 
ZOE: What are they up to? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. We must find out exactly what they're drilling for. 
ZOE: Not a chance with this thing guarding us. 
DOCTOR: Yes. If only we could create a diversion for a moment.

[Above a drill site]

(Jamie throws down a rock. The Quark and Balan look around.) 
JAMIE: Take this, you wee tin kettle! 
(Jamie throws another rock. The Quark spins round. Balan moves away. A third rock and the Quark fires at the cliff face.) 
JAMIE: Ah, you missed me! 
(Jamie throws another rock then runs down a gully with the Quark in pursuit, it's shots just missing him.) 
JAMIE: Now, Cully! 
(Cully sends a large boulder over the edge of the cliff. We hear a sort of high-pitched argh noise then see the Quark lying by a drill with large pieces of boulder on top of it.)

[Saucer]

(On the wall, a Quark symbol flashes.) 
TOBA: Another Quark has been destroyed! Quark, follow. 
(Toba leaves with a Quark.) 
ZOE: Somebody destroyed a Quark. But who? 
DOCTOR: Only one person here's strong enough to do that. 
ZOE: Jamie! Then he and Cully are alive! 
DOCTOR: Yes, alive and kicking by the sound of it. This is just what we needed. Now there's no time to waste. 
(The Doctor goes onto the central dais.) 
ZOE: What are you looking for? 
DOCTOR: Well, now's our chance to investigate the power unit and find out what fuel this ship carries. 
ZOE: Well the Quarks use ultrasound, so presumably it must be a fuel capable of producing a high enough energy quotient to sustain an amplifying complex of considerably sophisticated design. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Must be pretty powerful too. 
ZOE: Yes, well that's what. Well, if you don't want my help. 
DOCTOR: Oh I do, I do, I do, Zoe. Now, where do you think the power cells are located? 
ZOE: Well if the Quarks do use ultrasound to propel this craft. 
DOCTOR: No. Ultrasound has no horsepower, as such. 
ZOE: Oh, no. Well what do you think they use then? Not solid fuel rockets, surely? 
DOCTOR: No. More likely to be electromagnetic, probably produced by. Ah yes! Here we are, Zoe. Help me to get the inspection cover off. 
(It's a large square column on a hitherto unseen side of the control room.) 
DOCTOR: Here we are. Now then. Oh dear. 
ZOE: What? 
(The Doctor takes a Geiger counter on a long string from his pocket, and lowers down the inside of the column. The further down, the faster the clicks.) 
ZOE: Atomic fission reactor? 
DOCTOR: No. No, not exactly. But it's radioactive material of some sort. Zoe, this is a storage unit! That accounts for the strange disappearance of the radioactivity from the island. This unit sucked it up and stored it. 
ZOE: But then why are they drilling out there?

[Drilling site]

TOBA: A Quark has been destroyed, old man. Who did it? 
BALAN: I don't know. 
TOBA: Quark, report. 
QUARK: Alien attack. 
TOBA: Who was it? 
BALAN: I didn't see. I was here being guarded by your Quark. 
TOBA: Is there a hostile force on this island? 
BALAN: No! We have no such 
TOBA: Then who destroyed the Quark? 
BALAN: I don't know. 
(Toba pushes Balan to the ground.) 
TOBA: Quarks, search the island. Destroy any alien unaccounted for. Destroy!

[Council chamber]

TENSA: To remain passive is in itself a course of action. 
BOVEM: Director, Tensa speaks for the Emergencies Committee. Who else is competent to advise? We must do as he says. 
SENEX: Bovem, you say we must do as Tensa says, but that is negative, for we can do nothing. This is our tragedy. Perhaps if we show these creatures we mean no harm? 
COUNCILLOR 2: It's always possible that they mean harm to us. 
COUNCILLOR 1: Why should they? Surely no civilised race would indulge in purposeless violence? 
(Rago enters.) 
TENSA: Look! 
COUNCILLOR 2: What? Who? 
RAGO: You are the Council of this planet? 
SENEX: Yes, I am the Director. 
RAGO: You control the population? 
SENEX: Yes. We presume that 
RAGO: I require information. 
BOVEM: If you'd care to make an appointment. 
COUNCILLOR 2: That is, I'm sure, the correct procedure. 
RAGO: Listen and obey me. 
TENSA: Such discourtesy to our Director is not to be borne. 
RAGO: Silence! You will provide me with certain statistics. Open your files. 
TENSA: Really sir, I must protest! 
RAGO: Protest? You defy me? You defy a Dominator? 
TENSA: Senex is our leader and as such he demands respect. 
RAGO: I warn you, a Dominator must be obeyed. Your leader is nothing to me. I respect only one thing. Superior force. You will obey my command. 
TENSA: Sir, you would do better to request rather than command. 
RAGO: Silence! 
COUNCILLOR 1: Yes, perhaps if we were to explain the correct Dulcian procedure to you? 
COUNCILLOR 2: After all, your visit 
RAGO: I will give you no further warning! 
TENSA: I insist that you conduct this meeting in a manner acceptable to the Dulcian 
RAGO: Quark, destroy! 
(The Quarks kill Tensa.) 
RAGO: I have no wish to repeat such action. Let it serve to teach you that a Dominator must be obeyed without question. You, Director. It will be necessary for you to place at my disposal a certain number of the strongest of your species. 
SENEX: You wish our assistance? 
RAGO: Assistance. You are indeed an ingenuous race. I require slaves. Nothing more, nor less. 
SENEX: Slaves? But 
RAGO: Do not defy or question a Dominator. Obey, unless you wish to join your fellow countryman. 
SENEX: Had you come here in peace we'd have done our utmost to assist you, but 
RAGO: Dominators do not seek assistance. What we need we take. 
SENEX: Always by force? 
RAGO: If necessary. We control an entire galaxy. Our war mission is spreading to colonise others. Our Quarks must be released for this task, therefore we must replace their workforce on our home planets. 
SENEX: So you require our people as slaves? 
RAGO: Yes. 
SENEX: So we shall be transported to your planet? 
RAGO: Those who are selected will be fortunate. They will be saved. 
SENEX: Saved? From what? What of the rest of our people? 
RAGO: Enough questions. You will obey my commands! I shall require only the strongest of your species. You will be informed exactly how many I require. Remember, you can be crushed as simply as that if you do not cooperate. Quark, follow.

[Outside the museum]

TOBA: A drilling site has been attacked and a Quark destroyed. Who is responsible? 
KANDO: Cully, it must be! 
TOBA: What do you know about this? 
TEEL: How can we know anything? We've been here working. 
TOBA: Silence! 
(Toba twists Kando's arm.) 
TOBA: Talk. 
TEEL: Leave her alone. 
TOBA: Do you dare to defy a Dominator? 
TEEL: Just leave her alone! 
(Teel tries to grab Toba but is brushed off with one hand.) 
TOBA: Obviously you must be taught a lesson. Quarks, target! 
KANDO: Oh no! 
TOBA: No-one attacks a Dominator! Quark, power! 
(Teel screams.) 
KANDO: Oh, stop! 
TOBA: Well? Who was it that attacked and destroyed the Quarks? 
KANDO: I think it must have been Cully. 
TOBA: The man Cully is destroyed! 
KANDO: Then he must have escaped. There's no one else on the island. 
TOBA: Yes, there is. The other stupid one, the boy. Where would he hide? 
KANDO: I don't know! 
TOBA: Bring these back to the Dominator's craft. Help him. One of you creatures must know where the boy is, and you will tell me. Follow.

[Saucer]

ZOE: And Jamie really destroyed another Quark? 
BALAN: Yes, I feel sure it was Jamie. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Er, Balan. Oh. (nearly walks into a Quark) Balan, can you remember where the scientists who exploded that first atomic device got their materials from? 
BALAN: Many years ago, but I think that it was somewhere in the Northern hemisphere. 
ZOE: That's the other side of the planet. Then why are the Dominators drilling here? 
BALAN: Oh, they can't drill too deep here because the crust is too thin. 
DOCTOR: But perhaps that's why they've chosen this place! The magma, the molten core of the planet, could that be radioactive? 
BALAN: No. If so we'd have been aware of it from the minor eruptions we have from time to time. 
ZOE: But this whole operation was to refuel their fleet? But how? 
DOCTOR: It's these drill holes that intrigue me. One at each corner of a square, and one directly in the middle. But why? Why? 
(Toba enters with Kando and Teel.) 
TOBA: Put them with the others. Now, I want to know where the other creature is, the boy. The other stupid one. He has destroyed a Quark and defied the Dominators. Where is he? Quark! You will die one by one unless you tell me. Kill! 
(The Quark kills Balan.) 
TOBA: You. You're next. You know the boy. Where is he? Answer or you will die. 
(Kando and Teel move away from his target - the Doctor.)

Episode Five

[Saucer]

TOBA: Quark 
RAGO: Toba! What is the meaning of this? Explain. 
TOBA: We were being attacked and a Quark was destroyed. It was an emergency. 
RAGO: Emergency? A few hostile primitives manage to destroy a Quark and you expend time and power chasing them. 
TOBA: Don't you see 
RAGO: Why has the drilling stopped? All finished? 
TOBA: All perimeter bores are complete. 
RAGO: And the centre bore? 
TOBA: The centre bore is 
RAGO: Not even started. The Quark's power cells are dangerously low, and yet you send them scuttling all over the island on a pointless search and killing harmless aliens. 
TOBA: I considered it was my 
RAGO: Silence! Have the rockets been inserted into the perimeter boreholes yet? 
TOBA: No. 
RAGO: Do it. Is the seed device at a critical mass? 
TOBA: There has not been enough time. 
RAGO: Time? You have jeopardised this most vital part of the Dominator's war mission. You will remain on this planet and die with it. 
TOBA: Navigator Rago, I have been 
RAGO: You are useless unless you obey the Navigator's orders. Now check that seed device. 
ZOE: Oh. 
(Toba goes over to an egg shaped object in a clear box.) 
RAGO: Well? 
TOBA: Seed device is almost at critical mass. 
RAGO: You are fortunate, Toba. Now, time is running short. You must complete the operation with maximum speed. Has there been a reply from Fleet Leader concerning the potential use of slave labour force? 
TOBA: I will check. 
RAGO: No, I will. Take these aliens and place them under guard. Complete the centre borehole and place rockets in all perimeter holes, understood? 
TOBA: Command accepted. 
RAGO: Recall all Quarks from this ridiculous search and conserve their power. We can afford no more delays.

[Island]

(A Quark wastes energy shooting at a running Jamie and Cully. They duck down a sharp incline.) 
JAMIE: That was too close for comfort. 
CULLY: They're all around us. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
CULLY: Wait a minute. They're leaving, I think. Look! 
JAMIE: Hey, you're right. Come on, let's get back to the shelter while there's still a chance.

[Bomb shelter]

JAMIE: All right, Cully? 
CULLY: Yes. 
JAMIE: I've unblocked that ventilator shaft. At least we can breathe now. 
CULLY: Oh, I haven't have so much running about for years. Still, it was worth it. 
JAMIE: Aye, we certainly stirred them up, didn't we. Anyway, we'll lie low a wee while and then nip out and get another Quark. 
CULLY: Oh, you don't believe in half measures, do you. 
JAMIE: Well, it's important to keep the enemy guessing. Oh, I wish we had some food though. I'm fair famished. 
CULLY: Hold on, I seem to remember 
JAMIE: What? 
(Cully goes to a cupboard.) 
CULLY: Yes, survival kit. It goes with the shelter. Food, medicines, all that sort of thing. Ah! 
(Cully puts an oblong slab on the table.) 
JAMIE: Well, what's that? 
CULLY: Try it. Basic nutriments. Vitamins, carbohydrates, proteins. You can live on it for years. 
JAMIE: Oh, I hope I'll not need to do that. Here, did you unblock that periscope? 
CULLY: Yes. 
JAMIE: Good. Let's see if we were followed. 
(Jamie pulls down the periscope and looks around.) 
CULLY: Hey Cully, would you look who's here. 
(It's the Doctor, Teel and Kando.) 
JAMIE: Any Quarks? 
CULLY: Yes, one. 
JAMIE: Oh. 
(The periscope looks further to the left, where Toba is instructing a pair of Quarks at the drill head.) 
CULLY: No, there's more. Can't quite see but I think they're working at something just outside the building. 
JAMIE: Let's have a look. Aye, they don't seem to have harmed anybody. 
CULLY: Well, Balan isn't there. 
JAMIE: Aye, he's probably working somewhere else. 
(Jamie pushes the periscope back into the roof.) 
JAMIE: Look, Cully 
CULLY: What now? 
JAMIE: We can't just let them stay up there, can we. 
CULLY: Well, what can we do? 
JAMIE: Get them down here with us. 
CULLY: But what about the Quarks? 
JAMIE: Well, we'll just 
CULLY: Here we go again. But how? 
JAMIE: Aye well, I don't know yet. Ah, wait a minute. 
(Jamie takes a sheet off a bunk.) 
JAMIE: Yes.

[Outside the museum]

TOBA: Operate. 
(Two Quarks power the drill.)

[Museum]

(One Quark stands guard.) 
ZOE: Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Hmm? 
ZOE: What are they doing? 
DOCTOR: They're drilling. 
ZOE: Well, yes, I know that, but what for? 
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, I don't think they want to take anything out of the earth, Zoe, rather put something into it. 
ZOE: Well, what? 
DOCTOR: Well, if I'm right. Oh no! 
(Jamie has come up from the shelter and is creeping up on the Quark. He has the sheet twisted up into a rope and is about to throw it round its 'neck' when the Quark moves forward. Jamie moves forward and instead ties it around the robot's 'ankles'. Then it stands on Jamie's hand. The Doctor gets up.) 
DOCTOR: Excuse me. I wonder 
QUARK: Do not move! 
(The Quark moves towards the Doctor and Jamie pulls on the sheet rope, toppling it over onto it's side. Jamie sits on it as it makes beeping noises.) 
JAMIE: Right, Cully. 
(Cully puts another sheet over the Quark's head.) 
CULLY: Quick, follow me! 
JAMIE: Doctor, go on! 
CULLY: Quick! 
(When the others have run off, Jamie gets off the Quark.)

[Outside the museum]

TOBA: Cease drilling. A Quark is being attacked. Follow!

[Museum]

(Everyone is safely in the bomb shelter as Toba and the Quarks enter.) 
TOBA: Quarks. Search and destroy. 
(Toba takes the sheet off the Quark and puts it on its feet. It stops beeping.) 
TOBA: Quark, where are the prisoners? 
QUARK: Sensor out of action. No recorded data. 
TOBA: They can't be far away. They must be hiding. Quarks, search and destroy! 
RAGO: Command countermanded! Why has the drilling stopped again, Toba? 
TOBA: The prisoners have attacked a Quark and escaped. 
RAGO: And once again you drop everything to hunt them. I have just completed calculating the remaining power levels of the Quark force. Thanks to your foolish actions they are dangerously low. All efforts must now be concentrated on completing our mission. 
TOBA: And if they attack us again? 
RAGO: The Quark's power must be conserved. Complete the drilling operation. 
TOBA: Command accepted. 
RAGO: Toba. The primitives will not go unpunished. Fleet leader has just confirmed the Dulcians are unsuitable for slave labour. They will die with their planet. 
TOBA: Good! So the sooner we complete the drilling operations the sooner they will die. Quarks, follow.

[Bomb shelter]

(Cully has been looking through the periscope.) 
CULLY: They're gone. 
DOCTOR: That was very rash of you, Jamie. Those Quarks are appallingly dangerous. 
JAMIE: Och, they're not so terrible. 
CULLY: You know, we dropped a rock on one earlier. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
CULLY: Hey, where's Balan? Why wasn't he 
TEEL: He's dead, Cully. The Dominators killed him. 
CULLY: Oh, no. If only we'd managed to get him away too. 
KANDO: You did your best. Cully. 
TEEL: It's thanks to you and Jamie that the rest of us are safe. DOCTOR: I'm afraid not. Nowhere on the island is safe. Nowhere on the entire planet, come to that. 
JAMIE: You see we heard the Dominators say that the Dulcians were unsuitable for slave labour. 
TEEL: But then they'll leave us in peace? 
JAMIE: Well, no. They said you'd all die with your planet. 
KANDO: Surely they don't mean to destroy Dulkis completely? 
DOCTOR: I'm afraid they do. 
TEEL: But why? What do they want? 
DOCTOR: A large amount of fuel for their invasion fleet. 
ZOE: But we know that there are no minerals worth having. At least not on this side of the island. 
DOCTOR: They're not mining for minerals, or any natural fuel source. 
ZOE: But their spaceships use atomic power. We've established that. 
DOCTOR: But there was no reactor in their ship of theirs, only a radiation storage unit. You remember how, when they landed, it sucked up all the radioactive dust from the island? 
ZOE: Yes. So you're saying that they store radioactive particles and then convert that energy into power. 
DOCTOR: Exactly. 
ZOE: But then why are they drilling? 
DOCTOR: Look, I'll show you. (The Doctor uses a piece of chalk to draw on the table.) 
DOCTOR: There are four drill holes, here, here, here and here. And one drill hole in the centre. Now then, they have rockets mounted in each of these drill holes, and the centre hole is probably for that atomic seed device. 
JAMIE: Oh. 
DOCTOR: Well don't you see? They've chosen this spot because the crust of the planet is thin. They're going to fire the rockets through the crust into the magma, the molten core. 
ZOE: And that will almost certainly fracture the crust of the planet. 
DOCTOR: Exactly. 
ZOE: But that will create a volcano. And if they explode the atomic seed device in the middle of that 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right, Zoe. The whole planet will become one vast molten mass of radioactive material. The fuel store for their fleet. 
JAMIE: Well, we'll just have to stop them, then. 
DOCTOR: Oh Jamie, it's not as simple as that, is it? If only I could get hold of that atomic seed device, I might be able to defuse it. 
ZOE: Yes. Then there'd only be a local volcanic eruption on the island. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZOE: How can we get to the device? 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's the problem. 
JAMIE: Doctor, I've just had an idea. 
DOCTOR: Shush a minute Jamie, I'm trying to think. 
JAMIE: Yes I know you are, but 
ZOE: Oh Jamie. 
JAMIE: Will you listen to me. Now there's a dead easy way to get that device thing. 
ZOE: Really? 
JAMIE: Yes, now listen. You said they were going to drop it down the centre hole, the one they're drilling outside here. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
JAMIE: Well it's simple isn't it? All we've got to do is dig a tunnel through from here to the borehole and catch the seed device thing on it's way down. Well, it was just an idea. 
DOCTOR: But Jamie, it's a brilliant idea! It's so simple only you could have thought of it. 
JAMIE: Oh. Eh? 
ZOE: We can get the direction from the periscope. Just line it up with the drilling site. 
DOCTOR: Yes, there's only one snag though. Could we complete the tunnel in time? It'd have to be twelve feet long or more. 
JAMIE: Well Cully and I could delay the Dominators' work up there. 
ZOE: How? 
JAMIE: Oh, we're getting very good at destroying Quarks, aren't we? 
CULLY: Yes, certainly seems to stop them working. 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's true, but you've been lucky so far. If only I could devise some sort of weapon for you. Is anything down here, Cully? 
CULLY: I doubt it. Nothing but survival rations and medical kits. 
DOCTOR: Medical kit, oh. It's surprising what you can do with a few simple chemicals and a little ingenuity. Now come on, we must dig this tunnel. Zoe, give us a direction will you? 
ZOE: Right. Er, on a line from here. 
DOCTOR: Right! We start there tunnel there. Get that bunk away. Come on. 
JAMIE: That's it, Cully. I'll start it off with a knife, now. This line here. 
(Jamie tries to dig through the concrete with his sgian dubh.) 
DOCTOR: I think you'd better let me start it, Jamie. 
JAMIE: How are you going to dig through there with your sonic screwdriver? 
DOCTOR: It's a little more than a screwdriver. Just watch this. 
(The Doctor twiddles with his little device and it becomes an oxyacetylene torch, cutting easily through the wall.) 
TEEL: Where'd he get the technology to do that? 
KANDO: It's burning straight through. 
JAMIE: Aye, the Doctor's very good.

[Outside the museum]

TOBA: Cease drilling. 
RAGO: Report progress. 
TOBA: Proceeding as planned. Operation will be completed on schedule. 
RAGO: Good. All rockets are now in position. No further sign of the aliens? 
TOBA: No. 
RAGO: Good. Continue. Inform me when you are ready for the seed device. 
TOBA: Command accepted.

[Bomb shelter]

(Kando and Teel clear the entrance to their tunnel.) 
JAMIE: Oh, we can't wait much longer. 
CULLY: What's the Doctor trying to do? 
JAMIE: I've no idea. Look, Doctor, I don't think we should wait, you know. 
(The Doctor and Zoe are mixing chemicals.) 
DOCTOR: Hang on, Jamie. This is ready. Now if this works you should have a good chance of distracting the Quarks, and maybe even destroying one or two of them. Right, come on, Zoe, let's try it. 
ZOE: What, in here? 
DOCTOR: Yes, in here. There you are. Just a bit. 
ZOE: All right. 
(Zoe pours some powder into a small vial.) 
DOCTOR: Whoa, whoa, that'll do. Now then, Jamie, all you've got to do is to add one of these little number nine pills to each bottle just before you throw it, like that. 
(The Doctor drops in a pill and seals the vial.) 
DOCTOR: But whatever you do, and this is important, you must throw it before ten seconds have elapsed, otherwise you're liable to blow up with 
ZOE: Seven, eight, Doctor! 
DOCTOR: What? 
(The Doctor tosses the vial away and everyone ducks as it goes bang!) 
DOCTOR: It works! 
JAMIE: You could have blown us all to kingdom come! 
DOCTOR: No, no, Jamie, that was just a small quantity. But with ten times that amount you should have quite a handy little bomb.

[Above a drilling site]

JAMIE: Two each side. 
CULLY: Yes. Where do we start? 
JAMIE: Well one of the Quark's as good as another. Come on. 
(They go to a point on the cliff directly over the drill. Cully pops a pill into a vial and Jamie tosses it over the edge.) 
JAMIE: Two, three, four, five 
(Bang, and the middle Quark staggers then falls on its side, beeping.) 
JAMIE: Not quite. Quick, another one! 
(The repeat performance gets all three as the other two go to aid their comrade. Just a few smoking bits remain.) 
JAMIE: That's it! Quick, round the other side. 
(In the saucer, the Quark lights flicker. Rago heads out.)

[Outside the museum]

(The explosions can be heard.) 
TOBA: Cease drilling. Quarks, search and des. Wait. Continue working.

[Bomb shelter]

(Zoe is at the periscope.) 
ZOE: They've started again. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear. It's obviously going to take quite a disturbance to stop them drilling. Teel? Teel, how far have you got? 
TEEL: A little bit further than my own length. 
DOCTOR: Teel, come out and take your rest. Zoe, your turn. Come on. 
ZOE: I hope Jamie and Cully are all right. 
(Not so distant bang.) 
DOCTOR: It sounds as though they're having great fun.

[Outside the museum]

(A group of Quarks walking along a gully get treated to a couple of near misses. Meanwhile, Rago comes to the drilling point.) 
TOBA: Cease drilling. 
RAGO: Two more Quarks have been destroyed. 
TOBA: You should have let me destroy the aliens! 
RAGO: Silence! We have eight Quarks left, but their power levels are very low. Do your two Quarks have sufficient power to complete the drilling? 
TOBA: Quarks, check power levels and report. 
QUARK 1: Power level two units only. 
QUARK 2: Power level five units only. 
TOBA: Equalise. 
(The two Quarks hold hands.) 
TOBA: They will have enough for drilling. 
RAGO: Good. Continue operations.

[Above the museum]

JAMIE: They've started drilling again. Look, we've got to stop them somehow. 
CULLY: That's going to be tricky. 
JAMIE: I know, but the others need more time. Come on.

[Bomb shelter]

(Zoe has finished her stint in the tunnel.) 
ZOE: Oh, we must be merely six feet or so from the borehole, I can hear their drill. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but they must be nearly finished by now. 
TEEL: Right, I'll take another turn. 
ZOE: Is there any sign of Jamie and Cully? 
DOCTOR: No, they're still up there. Unfortunately they're taking 
(BOOM and the shelter quakes.) 
ZOE: Oh, that was close. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
(Zoe looks through the periscope to see the drill has fallen over and flattened one of the Quarks. Toba is trying to get up.) 
ZOE: I think they've attacked the drilling Quarks. 
KANDO: Has the drilling stopped? 
ZOE: I think. Yes!

[Outside the museum]

RAGO: Toba! 
TOBA: Ah, these primitives again! You see what damage they're doing with their primitive explosives? We must destroy them! 
RAGO: Replace the Quark. Continue operation. You will not be interrupted anymore. I will personally destroy these primitives. Quarks, follow.

[Island]

(Cully and Jamie run along a gully, but there are two Quarks ahead.) 
JAMIE: Back! 
(There are three more behind them.) 
CULLY: It's no good. We're trapped. 
JAMIE: Up here. Quarks can't climb, I hope. 
RAGO: Quarks, destroy. 
(The shots miss Jamie and Cully.) 
RAGO: Recharge force units. Report failure. 
QUARK: Power levels low. Distance too great for accurate aim. 
RAGO: Finish order. Destroy. 
(At the top of the slope, Cully is caught by a shot.) 
JAMIE: Come on. Right, Cully, I think we're safe now. 
CULLY: Wait. It's my arm. I can't move it. Nor my leg. You'd better leave me behind. 
JAMIE: Now don't be ridiculous. I'll give you help. 
CULLY: Those Quarks will be after us in no time. 
JAMIE: Aye. How many of those bombs have you got left? 
RAGO: Quarks, form a flank movement round this area. Disperse.

[Bomb shelter]

(The Doctor has been taking his turn at digging.) 
ZOE: Doctor, they've started drilling again. The blast didn't destroy that Quark and Toba's managed to get the drill working again. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I know, I can hear it up there. We must be pretty near. 
(The hatch opens.) 
DOCTOR: Shush. 
JAMIE [OC]: Doctor, help him. He's hurt. 
(Cully comes down the ladder.) 
DOCTOR: What happened? 
JAMIE: He was hit by a Quark. Lucky for him its power levels were low. 
DOCTOR: My word, lucky indeed! Come along, down you come. All right, Cully. Get over to the bunk. Get the table out of the way. Here. There we are. It's all right, Cully. Sit down. Mind your head. There we are, there. Now then. 
(Cully lies on the bunk.) 
CULLY: My arm seems to be paralysed. 
DOCTOR: Can you move your fingers? Ah, you're lucky. I think it's only temporary paralysis. 
CULLY: Oh, don't worry about me. Get on with the tunnel. 
DOCTOR: Thanks to you and Jamie, it's nearly finished. 
ZOE: Doctor, I think the Dominators have finished drilling too. 
DOCTOR: What? We've still got a few feet left!

[Outside the museum]

RAGO: Have you finished? 
TOBA: Yes, just completed. 
RAGO: Good! I shall enjoy destroying this planet and its creatures. Get the seed device. We will delay no longer.

[Bomb shelter]

DOCTOR: Can you see the borehole yet, Jamie? 
JAMIE [OC]: Och, the ceiling keeps caving in. 
ZOE: They're coming back! Toba's bringing the seed device. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear. 
JAMIE [OC]: I'm through!

[Outside the museum]

(Toba hands over the seed device in its box.) 
RAGO: You will recall all Quarks from their positions and prepare the craft for take off. 
TOBA: Command accepted. 
RAGO: I will insert the seed device. Prime the rockets at perimeter boreholes. 
TOBA: Command accepted. 
RAGO: I will soon see this planet die and it's creatures with it. 
TOBA: Shall I report to Fleet Leader? 
RAGO: Inform him the Dominator fleet may approach in its refueling orbit. 
TOBA: Command accepted. Quarks, follow.

[Bomb shelter]

ZOE: Quickly, Doctor. He's taking the device out of its case now. Oh, Jamie, he'll be too late. He's putting it in now. 
(Rago drops the seed device down the hole.) 
ZOE: It's gone! 
DOCTOR [OC]: Argh! 
JAMIE: Doctor, have you caught it? 
ZOE: Oh, Doctor. 
TEEL: He's coming. 
JAMIE: Quick, out. Well? 
(The Doctor holds up the large egg.) 
TEEL: We're saved! We're saved. 
DOCTOR: Not just yet. I've still got to defuse it before they explode it. Oh. Oh, my word. 
ZOE: What? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's sealed. It's completely sealed! I can't possibly undo it! 
JAMIE: You mean all that was for nothing? We're still going to get blown up? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid so, unless I can think of some way of getting it off the planet without a 
JAMIE: Have you thought of something? 
DOCTOR: Well, there is a way of getting it off the planet without it doing any harm to any of us at all. 
ZOE: Well how? 
DOCTOR: Ha! But it's not going to be easy. 
JAMIE: What're you going to do? 
DOCTOR: Now just leave it to me, Jamie. You and Zoe go back to the Tardis. Teel, take Kando and Cully and get them to the capsule and go to the Capital. Tell them that there'll be a minor volcanic eruption, but with any luck nothing more violent. 
JAMIE: But what're you going 
DOCTOR: There isn't time, Jamie! Come along!

[Outside the saucer]

RAGO: Is all prepared? 
TOBA: Yes. Just two more Quarks to arrive. 
RAGO: Start take off procedure. 
TOBA: Command accepted. 
(The Doctor runs across the island and gets to the saucer just as the last Quark arrives. It enters the airlock and he places the seed device behind it just before the inner door closes. He barely gets back out through the outer doors.)

[Saucer]

TOBA: All Quarks now accounted for. 
RAGO: Power level? 
TOBA: Capacity for lift off. 
RAGO: Electromagnetic field, contact! 
TOBA: All systems functioning. 
RAGO: Proceed with lift off! 
(The saucer lifts off from the sandy island, retracting its legs almost immediately.)

[Outside the Tardis]

ZOE: Oh where is he? 
JAMIE: The Dominator's ship. It's away! 
ZOE: Oh. 
JAMIE: Where's the Doctor? 
(The Doctor runs up behind them, out of breath.) 
ZOE: Doctor! 
JAMIE: Hey, where's the bomb thing? 
ZOE: Oh, did you get rid of it? 
JAMIE: Where is it? 
DOCTOR: Don't ask me any questions. There's no time. 
(There's a bang and a whoosh.) 
ZOE: What's that? 
DOCTOR: It's the rockets in the other perimeter holes. Come along. We'd better get inside the Tardis. There's going to be an all 
(The ground shakes.)

[Saucer]

RAGO: Toba! Stop the countdown. 
(The seed device rolls out of the inner airlock and across the floor. Dominator jaws drop in horror.) 
TOBA: Impossible, countdown has started! 
RAGO: Obey! 
(KaBOOM!)

[Outside the Tardis]

JAMIE: Doctor, come on, will ye? The whole place is going to blow up. 
DOCTOR: Oh, it's quite all right, Jamie. The planet is quite safe. There's just going to be a localised volcanic eruption. It'll only affect the island. 
JAMIE: Maybe so, but we happen to be on the island. 
DOCTOR: Oh, my word!

[Outside the Tardis]

(The former atomic test island on Dulkis is having a small volcanic eruption.) 
JAMIE: Doctor, come on, will you? Look! 
DOCTOR: Oh, my word! Come on, Jamie. Into the Tardis, quickly!

[Tardis]

(On the scanner the lava is seen heading towards them.) 
ZOE: Isn't it beautiful? 
JAMIE: Eh? 
ZOE: The volcanic eruption. It's beautiful! 
JAMIE: Beautiful? A great river of molten lava rolling, any minute 
DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie, a minute. Quiet! Oh! Oh dear! 
JAMIE: Something wrong? 
DOCTOR: Well, this sort of thing's happened before. The fluid links don't seem to be able to take the load. 
(Smoke comes out of the console.) 
DOCTOR: Oh! Oh! 
ZOE: Mercury vapour. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
JAMIE: Well, we can't stay here. We'll be buried by that lava. It's nearly on us. Look! 
DOCTOR: Oh, my word, what a wonderful sight. 
ZOE: Fantastic. 
JAMIE: Listen, will you two stop gaping at that and get us out of here. 
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Jamie. We're safe in the Tardis. 
JAMIE: Are you sure? 
DOCTOR: Well 
JAMIE: I mean, has the Tardis ever been buried up to its neck in lava before? 
DOCTOR: Well, no. 
JAMIE: Well, how can you be so sure we're going to be all right? 
DOCTOR: Well perhaps the fluid links have cooled down by now. That's a bit more power. Zoe, can you read off what that meter is registering, please? 
ZOE: Reading nine eight seven point three. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZOE: Point four. 
DOCTOR: Ah. 
ZOE: Five. 
DOCTOR: Oh no. 
ZOE: Six. It's jumped to nine nine one point. No, it's going up by numerals! 
DOCTOR: Oh no! 
DOCTOR: Oh! This darn thing's stuck! Of all the stupid, idiotic! 
(The console is smoking again.) 
JAMIE: Doctor! The lava's up to the Tardis! 
ZOE: It's reached the thousand danger mark, Doctor! 
DOCTOR: If only I could unstick this stupid, idiotic. Oh, there we are. Oh. 
ZOE: Have you done it? 
DOCTOR: No, but I've 
ZOE: Are we on our way? 
DOCTOR: I've stopped the fluid links from vapourising. We shan't suffocate. 
JAMIE: Aye, but if you don't hurry up and get us out of here, we'll be fried by that lava. 
ZOE: Well, isn't there any way we can get away? 
DOCTOR: Well there is an emergency unit, but, oh no, I can't possibly use that. 
ZOE: But this is an emergency! 
DOCTOR: But it moves the Tardis out of the time space dimension. Out of reality! 
JAMIE: Well, fine. Reality's getting too hot anyway. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I, oh all right. 
(The Doctor opens a compartment in the console pedestal and takes out a small unit.) 
DOCTOR: Here we are. Now then, which end was? Yes. No, look, I can't possibly use this. We don't know what will happen. 
JAMIE: Look, will you stop your jabbering and get on with it. Look! 
(The lava covers the scanner screen, which means it has reached the top of the Tardis. Jamie pushes the Doctor's hand down, clipping the new unit into the console controls. It's not the normal dematerialisation sound, and the light pulsates. Then it goes quiet.) 
JAMIE: Ah. There you are. We're all right. What was all the panic all about? 
DOCTOR: Is there any reading on the meter, Zoe? 
ZOE: Yes it's. Well, that's funny. There's no reading at all. 
DOCTOR: No. None of the meters are registering. Not one. 
JAMIE: Ah, but we're safe, aren't we? I mean, we're out of that lava stuff and we're all right here. 
DOCTOR: Yes, possibly. I'd better get working on the Tardis controls right away. 
ZOE: Doctor, we're not actually in flight, are we? 
DOCTOR: No. Why? 
ZOE: Well, then presumably we've landed. So why isn't the scanner showing anything? 
DOCTOR: Well, because, well, we're nowhere. It's as simple as that. I'll be in the power room, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Aye, right. 
(The Doctor leaves.) 
JAMIE: Hey! What does he mean, we're nowhere? 
ZOE: I don't know. I suppose he means that outside the Tardis now is nothing. Just nothing. 
(The scanner is blank.) 
JAMIE: Well, I'm away to change, and I suggest you do the same. You look like a wee McLarty. 
ZOE: A what? 
JAMIE: A ragamuffin, a. Oh, never mind.

[Power room]

(Zoe has changed into a glittering cat suit.) 
ZOE: Doctor? 
DOCTOR: What's happened? 
ZOE: Oh, nothing. It's all exactly the same. 
DOCTOR: Oh good, good. 
ZOE: You're worried by something, Doctor. What is it? 
DOCTOR: Me? Worried? No. No. It's only the unknown that worries me, Zoe. 
ZOE: But if there's nothing outside the Tardis and we're nowhere, then what is there to worry about? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. But you see, the emergency unit is limited to a certain time simply because it's 
ZOE: Because it's dangerous to stay where we are for any longer, yes. But we must be safe at the moment, otherwise the unit wouldn't let us stay here, would it? 
DOCTOR: You're interested in what's outside the Tardis now, aren't you? 
ZOE: Well, curious, yes. 
DOCTOR: Zoe, listen to me. If we move outside the Tardis, we step into a dimension about which we know nothing. We should be at the mercy of the forces outside time and space as we know it. 
ZOE: But Doctor, I still think we should go out and see. 
DOCTOR: Zoe, we must stay in the Tardis.

[Tardis]

(Jamie has put on a roll neck sweater instead of the dirty shirt, and is looking at the scanner. There are highland views and the sound of bagpipes. When Zoe enters, we don't hear the music any more.) 
ZOE: He's still got his head stuck in that 
JAMIE: Zoe, do you see that? Do you see where we are? 
ZOE: What? 
JAMIE: Look on the scanner! It's my home! It's Scotland! 
ZOE: Scotland? 
JAMIE: Aye! 
(The scanner is blank.) 
JAMIE: Oh. Oh, it was there. 
ZOE: Oh yes? 
JAMIE: Now look, I'm not seeing things, you know. It was there, I tell you. 
ZOE: Really? 
JAMIE: Aye. The mist must have covered it over. Aye, you get a lot of mist in the Highlands. 
ZOE: So you think we've landed then? 
JAMIE: Yes. I mean I couldn't have seen anything, could I? Oh, just a minute. 
ZOE: What? 
JAMIE: There's a wee gadget on here somewhere that warns you to go elsewhere if there's any danger. No, no it's definitely switched off. We've landed. 
ZOE: Well, I think it's more likely that you saw 
(Zoe sees a futuristic city on the scanner.) 
ZOE: It can't be, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Aye, it's switched off all right. 
ZOE: It's the city. My home. Jamie, you did see something, but it wasn't Scotland. 
JAMIE: Of course it was. Look, I know Scotland when I see it. 
ZOE: And I know my home city. Anyway, there's your proof. 
(The scanner is blank.) 
ZOE: But I don't understand. It was there. 
JAMIE: Yeah, I know. Scotland. 
ZOE: No. It was quite plainly. Oh, anyway, we've both seen something, so that proves we've landed, doesn't it? 
JAMIE: Yes. 
ZOE: Well, let's go out and see. 
JAMIE: Now not without the Doctor. 
ZOE: Oh, all right. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
(Jamie leaves. The city reappears on the scanner.) 
ZOE: It is! Jamie, Doctor, It is my home! Oh, come on! Now which one? 
(Zoe finds the door opening switch. It is just white outside.) 
ZOE: Oh, come on! 
(Zoe goes out through the doors and disappears. The city view on the scanner vanishes too.)

[Power room]

JAMIE: No, we definitely saw something! 
DOCTOR: But Jamie, it's not poss. You say you both saw different things? 
JAMIE: No! It was definitely Scotland. Zoe thought she saw something else, her. home city or something, but no, it was very misty and she couldnae have seen right. 
DOCTOR: So you both saw your homes? 
JAMIE: No, Doctor. I'm saying 
(The Doctor leaves.) 
JAMIE: Och.

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Zoe? Oh, my word! 
JAMIE: Where is she? 
DOCTOR: Zoe! Zoe! 
JAMIE: Och, I told her to wait. I'll go and get her. 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie. Don't you see? Those pictures that you and Zoe saw on the scanner were put there. Obviously put there to tempt you to go outside. 
JAMIE: But who by? 
DOCTOR: I don't know, but there's someone or something out there that wants us to go out of the Tardis. 
JAMIE: You mean some kind of danger? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. 
(There's a beep and a light flashes on the emergency unit.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, no. That's the first warning. There isn't much more time. 
JAMIE: What about Zoe? We can't leave her out there. I'll go and find her. 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie! No! 
(Jamie runs through the doors into the whiteness and disappears.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie! Jamie! 
(The warning sound gets faster.) 
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh no! 
(A strange rasping noise fills the console room.) 
DOCTOR: Who are you? Who are you? Where are you? What do you want with me? 
(The Doctor sits in a chair.) 
DOCTOR: No, no, I must fight. I must fight! I will fight!

[Limbo]

ZOE [OC]: Jamie? Doctor, where are you? 
(Zoe appears in the distance, in a white empty nothingness.) 
JAMIE [OC]: Zoe! Zoe! 
(Jamie appears from near us.) 
ZOE: Oh, Jamie, I though I was lost for good. 
JAMIE: Aye. It's funny out here isn't it? It's not the mist that we thought it was. It's er 
ZOE: Opaque. Nothingness. Just like the Doctor said. 
JAMIE: Aye. It doesn't feel right, though. Come on, back to the Tardis. 
ZOE: Is that the right way? 
JAMIE: Of course it's the right way. Oh. Er, no, it could be. Oh. 
ZOE: We're lost, aren't we? 
JAMIE: No, I wouldn't say that. We're just er. Well, we er. We just. You want to know something? 
ZOE: What? 
JAMIE: I think we're lost. 
ZOE: Oh, this isn't a joke, Jamie. 
JAMIE: No, you're right. The Doctor was saying that those images we saw in the scanner were put here to tempt us out. 
ZOE: Well, if there was somebody trying to tempt us away, where are they? And who are they? 
JAMIE: Aye. Aye, well, let's not be in too much of a hurry to find out, eh? 
ZOE: But what are we going to do? 
JAMIE: The Tardis can't be that far away. No. If we stand here and shout for the Doctor, when he hears us he can guide us back. Doctor? 
ZOE: Doctor! Can you hear us?

[Tardis]

(The Doctor keeps his eyes shut as he concentrates.) 
JAMIE [OC]: Doctor! 
ZOE [OC]: Doctor! 
JAMIE [OC]: Answer if you can hear us? 
DOCTOR [OC]: No. I will fight. I will fight!

[Limbo]

ZOE: Oh, Jamie, this is hopeless. We could be going round in circles. 
JAMIE: Aye. You know, I've got the funny feeling that we're being watched. Do you not feel it too? 
ZOE: Yes. 
(They are being watched by two white robots.) 
JAMIE: Can you see anyone? 
ZOE: No. No one at all. Jamie, look! 
JAMIE: What is it? 
ZOE: It's very faint, but I think it's my home again. 
JAMIE: Zoe, it's a trick. Now you know it is. 
ZOE: Oh Jamie, it's gone. 
JAMIE: Well, that proves it, doesn't it? A city like that doesn't just disappear, does it? 
ZOE: But it is out there. 
JAMIE: It's not, Zoe. You know it isn't. 
ZOE: No, I know. But for a moment I thought it was real. It was almost as though I was seeing what I most wanted to see. Oh Jamie, all right, we've got to get away. Jamie? 
(Jamie is staring at the Highlands and listening to bagpipes again.) 
ZOE: Jamie, it's not real. 
JAMIE: I know, but it's there. 
ZOE: No, Jamie, it's not. 
JAMIE: I must 
ZOE: No, Jamie, no! 
(Zoe slaps Jamie's face.) 
JAMIE: Oh! What did you do? 
ZOE: Oh, the Doctor's right. There is something or someone trying to tempt us away. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
(They hold hands and turn to see the white robots.) 
JAMIE: What are they? 
ZOE: I don't know, but they don't look very friendly. 
(They are surrounded by four robots. Then they see images of themselves dressed in white, beckoning them to come. Zoe screams.)

[Tardis]

(With his eyes still closed, the Doctor can see the white figures. He tries to communicate with his mind.) 
DOCTOR [OC]: Jamie, Zoe, don't go! Don't go! 
VOICE [OC]: Follow them. Follow and save them. 
(The Doctor opens his eyes.) 
DOCTOR [OC]: Who are you? What do you want? 
VOICE [OC]: Follow them. 
DOCTOR [OC]: No, I won't. I won't give in. 
VOICE [OC]: You will. You will. You will. 
(In the Limbo void, the robots use a chest device on Jamie and Zoe to mesmerise them. Zoe screams again.) 
VOICE [OC]: There is still time. Save them. Save them! 
DOCTOR [OC]: I can't let it happen. I can't. 
(The Doctor leaves the Tardis.)

[Limbo]

(The Tardis is white, too.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie? Zoe? 
DOCTOR [OC]: Jamie, Zoe, concentrate only on my words. Think of me. Think of the Tardis. They are the only real things here. Everything else is unreality. It is only in your minds. Now, concentrate. Come to me now. Now! Walk straight to the Tardis. Don't stop! 
(White-clad Jamie and Zoe move forward, escorted by the robots.) 
DOCTOR [OC]: Come on. Keep walking to the Tardis. Come on. Don't look behind you! Now, go in. Go in! 
(Jamie and Zoe are in front of the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, Zoe, go in before it's too late! 
(The robots use their mesmer beams again. The Doctor grabs Jamie and Zoe and pushes them to the Tardis.) 
DOCTOR: Go in!

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Go in! 
(Jamie and Zoe are wearing their normal clothes again. The Doctor closes the doors.) 
JAMIE: Doctor, what's been happening? 
DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie. Quiet. 
(The Tardis dematerialises.) 
DOCTOR: How do you feel? 
ZOE: What happened? Where have we been? 
DOCTOR: Nowhere. 
JAMIE: But but 
DOCTOR: All mental images, Jamie. Pure imagination. 
ZOE: But why? What's all this about? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. We've got to be careful. We've got to be very, very careful now. 
ZOE: But, careful? But we're safe enough back in the Tardis, aren't we? 
DOCTOR: Yes, possibly. 
(The metallic rasping sound starts up.) 
JAMIE: What's that? 
DOCTOR: I, I, I don't know. 
JAMIE: Oh, it's not the Tardis going wrong again? 
DOCTOR: No, no, we're on our way all right, but the trouble is I don't know where to. 
JAMIE: Well, that's not unusual. Look, just tell me when we get there, eh? 
ZOE: I'm sorry, Doctor. It was my fault. I shouldn't have gone outside. 
DOCTOR: That's all right, Zoe. I don't think you could help it. 
ZOE: Why not? 
DOCTOR: Well, I think whoever it was that was tempting you outside made it irresistible. Why, even I gave in when the voice said 
ZOE: What voice? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. Perhaps there wasn't one. Perhaps it was just illusion. 
ZOE: But we are safe now? 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, yes. The Tardis is performing quite normally. Oh, that's odd. 
ZOE: What? 
DOCTOR: Well, this meter's dropped below a thousand. 
ZOE: Well, is that critical? 
DOCTOR: No. It just means that we're using more power than we're storing, but don't worry. We've got n emergency power booster unit here somewhere, if I can find the switch. Now. No. Oh dear. It's here somewhere. 
(Jamie is sleeping in the chair, and starts having a nightmare. There's the sound of a horse neighing.) 
DOCTOR: Ah! 
ZOE: Found it? 
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, that's the one. Now just a little bit more power and, read off the meter for me, will you, Zoe? 
ZOE: Reading nine nine oh. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZOE: One. 
DOCTOR: Good. 
ZOE: Two. 
DOCTOR: Fine. 
ZOE: Three. 
(Jamie wakes with a shout.) 
DOCTOR: Quiet, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Oh. What's been happening? 
ZOE: Four. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZOE: Steady at four. 
DOCTOR: Oh, no. Oh. 
JAMIE: Is something wrong? 
ZOE: Five. 
DOCTOR: Good. 
ZOE: Six. 
DOCTOR: Fine. 
ZOE: Seven, eight. 
DOCTOR: Oh, let it creep up now. I don't want to blow the fluid links again. 
JAMIE: I just had the most peculiar dream. There was this big white horse with a horn right in the middle of his head, and 
ZOE: A unicorn? 
JAMIE: Hey? Aye, probably. He was charging straight towards me. 
ZOE: Nine nine eight. 
JAMIE: Head down, ready for the kill! I thought any moment 
ZOE: Oh really, Jamie. Your imagination is 
JAMIE: What's the matter? 
ZOE: I don't. Jamie, look. 
(The Doctor has his eyes closed and his hand against his head.) 
JAMIE: Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Hmm? 
JAMIE: What's up? 
DOCTOR: Quiet, Jamie, quiet. 
(Jamie winces from a pain in his head.) 
DOCTOR: That sound. That vibration. It's alien. 
ZOE: I can feel it too. In my head. 
DOCTOR: I don't seem to be able to concentrate. Concentrate. Both of you, concentrate on something! 
ZOE: I can't! 
JAMIE: What is it? 
DOCTOR: Read out the figures to me, Zoe, aloud. Go on. 
ZOE: Nine nine one. 
DOCTOR: Louder! Both of you, read them off! 
ZOE: Two. 
DOCTOR: Oh, it's getting stronger. 
ZOE + JAMIE: Three. 
DOCTOR: It's dragging me! 
ZOE: Four. 
DOCTOR: Concentrate! Both of you! 
ZOE + JAMIE: Five. 
DOCTOR: Oh, it's too strong! 
ZOE + JAMIE: Six. 
DOCTOR: It's too powerful! 
ZOE + JAMIE: Seven. 
DOCTOR: Oh, it's too powerful. 
ZOE + JAMIE: Eight. 
DOCTOR: No, I must fight! 
ZOE + JAMIE: Nine. 
DOCTOR: I must fight! 
ZOE + JAMIE: Ten. 
DOCTOR: I will fight! 
ZOE + JAMIE: Eleven. 
(The sides of the Tardis come apart, leaving Jamie and Zoe lying on the console, hanging on grimly as it slowly spins in the blackness.) 
ZOE: Jamie, the Doctor! 
(Zoe screams, a lot. The Doctor is spinning, eyes closed, as the console disappears into a sudden mist.)

Episode Two

[Forest]

(There is ground, and thick square-cut timbers places as if they were trees. Jamie is searching.) 
JAMIE: Doctor? Zoe? Where are you? What's happened? 
ZOE [OC]: Jamie! Jamie, over here! 
JAMIE: Zoe? Is that you? 
(Jamie sees a soldier loading a musket.) 
JAMIE: Redcoats. Am I back in my own time? If I am, they'll shoot me down. 
(Jamie takes out his sgian dubh and steps forward.) 
JAMIE: Shoot me down like a dog, would you? Well, a McCrimmon's never died without a fight yet. Creag an tuire! 
(The Redcoat shoots, and Jamie turns into a cardboard cut-out.) 
ZOE [OC]: Jamie? Jamie! 
(Elsewhere -) 
ZOE: Jamie, I'm here! Where are you? Jamie, can you hear me? Jamie! 
(Zoe turns to see a large dressed-stone wall with bare-branched shrubs in front of it. She turns again and there is another wall.) 
ZOE: Jamie, Doctor, help! Somebody help me! I'm trapped! 
(A gothic pair of doors appear in the wall and creak open. Zoe steps through and falls down a hole, screaming. The door shuts.)

[Control room]

(The cardboard Jamie is on one screen, and the gothic doors on another.) 
MASTER: Good. Good. Excellent. And now the good Doctor. Where is he? 
(A third screen shows the forest.) 
MASTER: Look around. He must be here somewhere. Find him. Search. 
(There is a figure seated at a control desk with his back to us. When he gives commands his voice is harsh, when he talks to himself it is gentle.) 
MASTER: I see. He has eluded us for the moment. So he is not yet completely under my control. Perhaps it is better this way. Yes. He'll soon find out. Find him. Search all areas.

[Forest]

(The Doctor is sitting leaning against a timber.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie. Zoe. Jamie. Fight. I must fight. Fight! Fight! 
(The Doctor wakes and looks around.) 
DOCTOR: Where in time and space am I? Where are the others? Jamie? Zoe? 
JAMIE [OC]: Doctor! Hello! 
DOCTOR: Jamie, is that you? 
ZOE [OC]: Jamie! Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Zoe! Zoe? 
ZOE [OC]: Doctor, I'm trapped. Help me, please! 
(The Doctor runs around the timbers, getting nowhere.) 
DOCTOR: All right, Zoe, just stay where you are and I'll see if I can find you. Hello? Call out to me! 
JAMIE [OC]: Here! Over here! 
DOCTOR: Yes, all right, Jamie. 
ZOE [OC]: Hello, Doctor! I'm over here! 
DOCTOR: All right, Zoe. 
JAMIE [OC]; Over here. 
DOCTOR: All right, Jamie. 
ZOE [OC]: Doctor, please! 
DOCTOR: No! No! No! No! No! Not both together. One at a time! Now then, Jamie, you seem to be the nearer. You first. Count up to ten. 
JAMIE [OC]: One, two, three, four, five

[Control room]

MASTER: Find him. Search. Search! Perhaps some light will help.

[Forest]

DOCTOR: This is like exploring a maze in the dark. 
(And the lights come on.) 
DOCTOR: Well, thank you, whoever you are. 
(Mechanical footsteps echo and the Doctor hides to watch giant tin soldiers with lamps on their tall helmets go past.)

[Control room]

MASTER: Spread out. Cover the whole area. Slowly. Keep moving. Look left to right. Search every inch of the forest. I know the Doctor is here somewhere. Hmm. No sign of him. Well, he can't be far away. We'll continue on this course. Track him down. Those are your orders. He must be found.

[Forest]

(The tin soldiers clank past and the Doctor comes out of hiding.) 
DOCTOR: {loud whisper) Jamie! Zoe! 
GULLIVER: Heckinah degul. 
(The Doctor is confronted by a man with a flint-lock pistol. Everyone say Hi! to Bernard Horsfall.) 
GULLIVER: Tolgo fonac. 
(He gestures the Doctor to approach.) 
GULLIVER: Langro dehul san? Grildig? Splacknuck? 
DOCTOR: Parlez-vous Francais? 
GULLIVER: Recalsitrat (?) undique tutis! Glandack daytan! 
DOCTOR: Do you speak English by any chance? 
GULLIVER: Sir, my birth was of honest parents in an island called England. 
(And that's the final clincher who this character is - his words all come from Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, good gracious me. Why didn't you say so at once? 
GULLIVER: I spoke in as many languages as I have the least smattering of. High and low Dutch, Latin. 
DOCTOR: Well, let's start at the beginning again, shall we? What did you say to me? 
GULLIVER: I said, beware false traitor, highwayman, robber, pickpocket, murderer. 
DOCTOR: I think you must be making some mistake. Highwayman, indeed? Can you tell me when you were last in England? 
GULLIVER: We set sail from Bristol on May the 4th, 1699. 
DOCTOR: We? 
GULLIVER: What became of my companions I cannot tell. They were all lost. 
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear sir, you and I are in the same boat. 
GULLIVER: You have a stout ship? 
DOCTOR: No, no, no, unfortunately, no. Look, would you mind taking that pop gun away? It does unsettle me so. 
GULLIVER: Well sir, if you can assure me you are no traitor. 
DOCTOR: Now how can I be a traitor when I don't even know where I am? Where am I? 
GULLIVER: I cannot tell. 
DOCTOR: That makes two of us, doesn't it. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Listen, I've lost my companions too. Two of them, a boy and a girl, Jamie and Zoe. You haven't seen them by any chance? 
GULLIVER: Alas, no. 
DOCTOR: No, no. Well, I've got to find them. Perhaps you could help me, if you know your way around. 
GULLIVER: It is not permitted. 
DOCTOR: Who says so? 
GULLIVER: The Master! 
DOCTOR: The Master? 
GULLIVER: He has articles of impeachment against you for treason and other capital crimes. 
DOCTOR: Treason again. Really. 
GULLIVER: I leave you to your prudence what measures you will take. And now sir, to avoid suspicion, I must retire in as private a manner I came. 
(Gulliver bows slightly and walks away.) 
DOCTOR: Oh but sir. Oh no, don't go. I wanted to ask you. (Gulliver has vanished.) 
DOCTOR: A hallucination? Oh, well. Jamie? Zoe! 
DORA [OC]: Cooeee! 
DOCTOR: Is that you, Zoe? 
(A Victoria or Edwardian girl appears behind the doctor and a boy in front of him. She is from Edith Nesbit's Treasure Seekers, the eldest of the Bastable children.) 
DORA: Cooeee! 
DOCTOR: Who's that? Who are you? 
(Now there are four boys and two girls around him.) 
DOCTOR: Well. Well, well, well, well, well. How do you do? 
OSWALD: Why did the chicken cross the road? 
DOCTOR: Well, really, I don't think this is the time for riddles. 
DORA: You must answer. Why did the chicken cross the road? 
DOCTOR: Oh very well. To get to the other side, or so I've always been led to believe. Now would you mind telling me 
OSWALD: Which is correct. The yolk of an egg is white or the yolk of an egg are white? 
DOCTOR: Neither, it's yellow. 
ALICE: How many beans make five? 
DOCTOR: I 
DICKY: Where was Moses when the lights went out? 
DOCTOR: Well, I 
NOEL: Adam and Eve and Pinch Me went down to the river to bathe. 
CHILDREN: Adam and Eve got drowned. Who do you think was saved? 
DOCTOR: Well, Pinch Me, obviously. 
(So they pinch him, obviously.) 
DOCTOR: Ow! No! Stop it! Don't do that! Now it's my turn to ask you questions. (The first boy holds a sword blade to the Doctor's throat.) 
OSWALD: What can you make of a sword? 
DOCTOR: Huh? 
OSWALD: What can you make of it? 
DICKY: Rearrange it. 
NOEL: Think. 
DORA: This is your last chance. 
ALICE: S W O R D. Rearrange. 
DOCTOR: S W O R D. Rearrange. Well, rearranged it makes W O R D S. Words. 
CHILDREN: Hooray! 
(Oswald throws the sword in the air. The Doctor reaches to catch it and gets a large book instead.) 
DOCTOR: Well, it's a dictionary. Words. 
OSWALD: You have answered correctly. 
DORA: You may be suitable. 
DOCTOR: Suitable? 
ALICE: I do hope so. 
HORACE: Come on, it's teatime! 
DICKY: I'm hungry! 
NOEL: Race you home! 
(The children run off and vanish.) 
DOCTOR: Words. 
JAMIE [OC]: Doctor. Over here! 
DOCTOR: Jamie? Jamie? Is that you? 
(He sees the cardboard cut-out.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie! It's just another trick! Hello? What's this? A safe? Locked, of course. And a wishing well. I wish. I wish I believed in wishing wells. 
(The Doctor drops the dictionary down the well. There is the sound of derisive laughter then an image appears in the mist - M and T crossed through.) 
DOCTOR: Hello. This is a puzzle, that's what it is. 
(Another image of a fortune readers palm diagram, with a H crossed through.) 
DOCTOR: Oh yes. Yes, I'm beginning to recognize this. Sort of picture writing. Let me see now. Jamie. Mist. Mist without the M or the T, i s. Is. Hand without the H, and. So we have Jamie is safe and well! 
(There is a pop, and the cardboard Jamie is next to him without a face.) 
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, I've lost his face. 
(There is a board next to the Doctor containing a selection of eyes, noses and mouths.) 
DOCTOR: Hello. Oh, I see. I'm supposed to provide the face, am I? Very well. Now then. Yes. There we are. 
(He puts a pair of eyes on Jamie.) 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, that's his nose all right. And, yes. Yes. 
(As soon as he puts the mouth in place -) 
DOCTOR: Oh no, I've done it wrong! Oh! 
(Jamie comes back to life. Everyone say Hi to Hamish Wilson who is filling in while Fraser Hines is off with chicken pox - hence the re-write of this episode.) 
JAMIE: Doctor. Oh, I'm glad to see you again. 
DOCTOR: But, but you're not Jamie. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
(Someone chuckles.) 
JAMIE: What are you on about? 
DOCTOR: Well, your face, it's different. 
JAMIE: What do you mean, different? 
DOCTOR: Well, look. Look in the mirror. 
(The Doctor takes a mirror out of his pocket.) 
JAMIE: That's not my face! 
DOCTOR: Well, it's the one you're stuck with for the moment. 
JAMIE: But why should I suddenly be different? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. It's a particularly nasty trick on the part of the person who brought us here. 
JAMIE: Brought us here? What's happening? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. Just a minute. If you really are Jamie, you should know what's happened. How did you get here? 
JAMIE: Well, you know I was telling you about my dream. You know, about the unicorn. 
DOCTOR: Yes? 
JAMIE: Well, he was charging straight for me, head down, ready for the kill, when suddenly everything went crazy and I was off. 
DOCTOR: Off? Where to? Where've you been? 
JAMIE: In the fog. I mean, really. Ever since the Tardis broke up. 
DOCTOR: It did what? 
JAMIE: It broke up. It fell to bits. The next thing I knew I was wandering about here. I heard you calling but I couldn't find you. 
ZOE [OC]: Jamie! Help! 
DOCTOR: Zoe? Where are you? 
ZOE [OC]: I'm trapped. You must help me! 
JAMIE: It sounds as if she's over there. 
DOCTOR: What? Come on, then! 
(Jamie and the Doctor run through the timbers to the gothic door.) 
DOCTOR: Zoe! 
ZOE [OC]: I can't get out! Help me, please! 
JAMIE: There's no handle. There's no sign of a lock either. 
DOCTOR: Don't you see? It's not even a door at all. It's just a brick wall with a door painted on it. 
JAMIE: But that's crazy! How do you open a door that isn't a door? 
DOCTOR: Now let me think. 
JAMIE: What's the good of thinking? What we want is a battering ram. 
DOCTOR: When 
JAMIE: One of these trees. 
DOCTOR: Is a door not a door? 
JAMIE: Och, this is no time for riddles. 
DOCTOR: No. When is a door not a door? 
JAMIE: Eh? 
DOCTOR: When it's ajar! 
JAMIE: Eh? 
ZOE [OC]: Get me out! Get me out! 
(Zoe appears, trapped in a large glass preserves jar. Jamie and the Doctor laugh.) 
ZOE: Get me out! Get me out! 
JAMIE: Oh, Zoe. 
ZOE: Get me out! 
JAMIE: Not unless you promise to be a good girl. 
ZOE: Oh, you. 
DOCTOR: Go on, get her out. 
JAMIE: All right. 
(Jamie rips through the paper lid and helps Zoe out.) 
JAMIE: Come on then. Up you come. One, two, three. 
ZOE: I thought I was never going to get out of. Well, who are you? 
JAMIE: Eh? Don't you start, Zoe. I've had enough from the Doctor. I tell you I'm me, Jamie! 
ZOE: Well, why does he look so different? 
DOCTOR: Well, I'll tell you later. I think it's about time we got out of this wood. 
JAMIE: Aye, this place gives me the creeps. 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, you go on ahead, Jamie. 
(Jamie leaves.) 
ZOE: Is that really Jamie? 
DOCTOR: Well. Well, yes. 
ZOE: But he couldn't just have changed like that, I mean it's impossible. 
DOCTOR: Well, I think we may be in a place where nothing is impossible. Come on. 
(Time has passed, and they are still wandering amongst the timbers, getting nowhere.) 
ZOE: Oh my feet ache. I'm going to sit down and have a rest. 
JAMIE: If only we could see over these trees. Doctor, if you could give me a leg up, I could shin up one of them. 
DOCTOR: Yes, good idea. Come along. 
(Jamie goes inside a large, apparently hollow, timber.) 
DOCTOR: Up you go. Can you manage? 
JAMIE: Aye, I think so. It's a bit tricky but I'm nearly there. 
DOCTOR: There's a foothold. 
JAMIE: Ah! I'm at the top. Doctor. 
ZOE: What is it? Can you see something? 
JAMIE: I can see all right. Do you know what this tree is? 
DOCTOR: No, what? 
JAMIE: It's a letter S. The next one's an L, and then an O and a W. It's a forest of words. 
DOCTOR: This must be a world of words. 
ZOE: Well, what do the words say? 
JAMIE: Slow but sure. In for a penny. 
DOCTOR: In for a pound. They're all sayings, proverbs. 
JAMIE: Look before you leap. I can't read any more. 
ZOE: Well, never mind that. Can you see a way out? 
JAMIE: I think so. Yes. Yes. 
DOCTOR: Down you come. There's a foothold. Can you manage? That's right. Steady. There. 
JAMIE: There we are. It's this way. 
(A little way along, they meet Gulliver with his pistol again.) 
ZOE: Oh, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: It's all right. Don't worry, I've met this gentleman before. He's a traveller like ourselves. 
GULLIVER: Sir. 
DOCTOR: Delighted to meet you again, sir. Allow me to present my two companions. This is Zoe, and this is Jamie. 
JAMIE: How do you do, sir. 
DOCTOR: We're trying to find our way out of this wood. 
GULLIVER: This resolution may perhaps appear very bold and dangerous. 
ZOE: But we've got to get away. 
DOCTOR: Well, haven't you ever tried to escape from this place? 
GULLIVER: No. No, I looked upon myself to be fully settled for life. 
DOCTOR: These tests, what's the point of them? 
GULLIVER: In choosing persons for all employments, they have regards to great abilities. A course of study is required to qualify any man for the service of his country. 
ZOE: But who's in charge hear? Who's setting all these tests for us? 
GULLIVER: The Master. 
DOCTOR: Oh, the Master again, eh? I suppose this army of robots works for the Master as well. 
GULLIVER: Army? As to their military affairs I knew not what they meant. 
DOCTOR: Oh, surely you've seen them. 
GULLIVER: I knew not what they meant. 
DOCTOR: Ah now, but surely. That's the sound they make. They're coming back! 
ZOE: Well, what do we do? 
DOCTOR: We hide in among the trees. Quick! There's a J, there's room for two! Oh, thank goodness there's a letter C. You, sir, aren't you going to take cover? 
GULLIVER: The best expedient I could think on was to keep guard. 
ZOE: Well, whatever you do, don't give us away. 
(Zoe, Jamie and the Doctor hide as the tin soldiers approach.) 
GULLIVER: I could not forebear smiling, sir. What you told me is mistaken. There was no army here. 
(The soldiers find Zoe and Jamie.)

[Control room]

MASTER: At last. Very well. Round them up and lead them away. You have your orders. You know what to do.

[Forest]

JAMIE: Thank you very much. 
ZOE: Why did you give us away? 
GULLIVER: But I said there was no army here. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, Zoe, don't you see? As far as he's concerned, they don't exist. He can't see them. 
GULLIVER: And now, sir, I must forebear to trouble you further. Having answered the only objections you have raised against me, I now take a final leave of you all. 
DOCTOR: Sir. 
JAMIE: Hey, but wait a bit 
DOCTOR: I think the soldiers want us to go in the other direction. 
ZOE: Doctor, these soldiers. Am I mad or do they look like toy soldiers? 
DOCTOR: Yes. Particularly dangerous toys too. Come along, let's go. 
(They walk into an empty blackness.) 
ZOE: They've stopped. 
JAMIE: Why have they brought us here? 
DOCTOR: Well, we shall soon find out.

[Control room]

MASTER: Mission is accomplished.

[Blackness]

ZOE: It's so dark. 
JAMIE: You know, I've got a funny sort of a feeling I've been here before. 
DOCTOR: Shush! Listen. 
JAMIE: It sounds like a horse galloping. 
ZOE: It's getting nearer. It's coming this way! 
DOCTOR: It's not a horse. Look! 
(A dappled grey equine with a long horn in the middle of its forehead is tossing its head.) 
ZOE: A unicorn. 
JAMIE: My dream. 
ZOE: It's looking at us! 
DOCTOR: Keep quite still. 
JAMIE: It's coming straight for us. Run! 
DOCTOR: No! 
JAMIE: We don't stand a chance! 
DOCTOR: Stand still. 
JAMIE: Doctor. 
ZOE: Oh, Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Hold your ground! 
JAMIE: Come on, this is my dream. 
DOCTOR: No, stand still!

Episode Three

JAMIE: It's coming straight for us. Run! 
DOCTOR: No! 
(The Doctor hangs on to Jamie and Zoe's wrists.) 
JAMIE: But we haven't got a chance! Don't you see, it's my dream all over again. 
ZOE: It's real. 
DOCTOR: No, it's not real. It's a legend. You mustn't believe in it, you mustn't. Say it doesn't exist. Say it. 
JAMIE + ZOE: It doesn't exist. 
(The unicorn stops in mid-gallop and becomes a cardboard cut-out.) 
JAMIE: What happened? 
DOCTOR: Another test. 
JAMIE: But it was alive. We all saw it. 
ZOE: It was terrifying. 
DOCTOR: He challenged us to believe it. 
JAMIE: Who? The Master? 
DOCTOR: Whoever it is who's setting up all these conjuring tricks. 
ZOE: But I don't understand. 
DOCTOR: Well, the unicorn appeared to be real until you said it wasn't. Then we were safe. 
ZOE: But we believed in it, Jamie and I. 
DOCTOR: Yes, that was just the danger. Your belief was affecting me. 
JAMIE: Who would think up a crazy notion like this? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. A fantastic mind.

[Control room]

MASTER: Too kind. And if I may, I'd like to return the compliment. He's obviously supremely intelligent. He's learning the rules with admirable speed. Yes, you were right to choose the good Doctor.

[Blackness]

JAMIE: Doctor. 
ZOE: The soldiers.

[Control room]

MASTER: Stop! Let them go. Wherever they run, whatever they do, every step they take will only brings them nearer. The trap is set. Let them walk into it.

[Tangled forest]

(Instead of giant letters, this is bare shrubs with thick cobwebs. Jamie uses his sgian dubh to hack a path through.) 
ZOE: Oh, how much further? 
JAMIE: There's no sign of the toy soldiers now. 
DOCTOR: We've got to get out of this place. 
JAMIE: Look, there's a house. 
(The Redcoat is standing in front of the door.) 
JAMIE: You again. I'll sort you this time. Creag an tuire! 
(The Redcoat shoots Jamie point blank.) 
ZOE: Jamie! Doctor? 
(Jamie is a cardboard cut out with a blank face again.) 
DOCTOR: Now it's all right, Zoe. Oh, come on, come on. If you want to play games, let's get on with it. 
(Laughter.) 
ZOE: What's that? 
(The board with Jamie's identikit face arrives.) 
DOCTOR: Well, I have to make up his face again. 
ZOE: You did this before. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZOE: And that's how Jamie's face got changed. You got it all wrong. 
DOCTOR: What? No. No, no. Well I, I was rushed. Now then. There we are. 
(Zoe shakes her head at the Doctor's choice of eyes.) 
DOCTOR: All right, I know. There we are. One. Now then. Oh yes, that's his nose. You can't mistake his nose, can you. And.) (The Doctor reaches for a mouth then looks at Zoe. She smiles so he selects it and places it on Jamie's picture.) 
DOCTOR: There you are, you see. 
(Fraser Hines is back.) 
ZOE: Jamie. 
DOCTOR: Jamie. 
ZOE: Thank goodness you're back. 
JAMIE: Back? What do you mean back? I haven't been anywhere. 
ZOE: You've got your face back. 
JAMIE: I have? 
DOCTOR: Yes, look. 
(Jamie takes the Doctor's mirror.) 
JAMIE: Oh, you're right, I have. Oh, that's much better. Ah, the house. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Come along. Let's go inside. 
(Jamie opens the gothic squeaking door that originally trapped Zoe.)

[Maze]

(This time no one falls anywhere. This is a rough stone edifice where candles drip in wall sconces and large cobwebs are the main decoration and there is the sound of dripping water from somewhere. The door creaks shut on its own.) 
ZOE: There must be someone here. These candles are alight. 
JAMIE: Hello, there. 
(His voice echoes.) 
ZOE: One, two, three, four tunnels leading off. 
JAMIE: It would be easy to get lost in there. 
DOCTOR: Just a moment. 
JAMIE: What's he found? 
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, A ball of twine. Hmm. Oh yes. This must have been an invitation. 
ZOE: Why? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's the classical way of getting through a maze. Now, Jamie, tie that to the door will you. 
JAMIE: Hey, it's locked. 
ZOE: Then we are meant to go on. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think we are. 
(Jamie ties the end of the twine to the door handle.) 
ZOE: But that means that wherever we go, at any time, they know. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZOE: They're expecting us. 
DOCTOR: Don't break the thread. Come along.

[Control room]

(On a monitor, three lights mark their progress through the labyrinth.) 
MASTER: Ah, at last. The Doctor is commendably prompt. I wonder how long it will take him to get to the heart of the mystery.

[Tunnels]

(They have been walking for some time, because the ball of twine has almost run out.) 
DOCTOR: Which way, do you think? 
ZOE: To the right. 
DOCTOR: They both look equally unattractive to me. 
ZOE: But it must be to the right. I've been working it out as we went along. 
JAMIE: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Shush. How? 
ZOE: Well, as soon as we avoided the dead ends, it soon fell into a clear pattern. One left, two right, three left, four right and so on. It's a simple arithmetic progression. 
JAMIE: Yes, but Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie. 
DOCTOR: What it is to have an arithmetical brain. What do you want? 
JAMIE: The thread's run out. Now, should we not go back? 
DOCTOR: No, you stay here. 
JAMIE: Ah. 
DOCTOR: And Zoe and I will explore a little further. There must be another way out of this maze and I mean to find it. 
(The Doctor goes right.) 
ZOE: You see, they don't want us to find a way out, only a way in. 
(Zoe follows the Doctor. Jamie starts whistling.)

[Control room]

(The display shows that they are getting close to the centre of the labyrinth.) 
MASTER: Go on, go on. You're almost there.

[Labyrinth centre]

(The Doctor and Zoe come out of a tunnel.) 
ZOE: I was right. This isn't the way out. We're in the middle of the maze. Oh Doctor, I don't like it. Let's go. 
DOCTOR: Just a minute. I was rather expecting a welcoming committee. but perhaps I was wrong. 
ZOE: Well, I hope you were. 
DOCTOR: Ah yes, but there has been someone here. Not so long ago, either. Look. 
(It's a disarticulated skeleton.) 
ZOE: Oh! 
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh. 
ZOE: And there's some tracks of an animal, too. Oh Doctor, let's go. 
(Something big roars.) 
ZOE: It couldn't be. 
DOCTOR: What? 
ZOE: Well, I know it's silly, but do you remember the story of the Minotaur? 
DOCTOR: Half man, half bull, yes. 
ZOE: And he lived in the heart of a labyrinth. And there were human sacrifices! 
DOCTOR: Exactly, but I don't think we need be too alarmed. After all 
(Roar. The Doctor and Zoe have their arms around each other.) 
DOCTOR: As I was saying, as long as we're quite certain the minotaur is only a 
ZOE: Doctor, look! 
(The shadow of a horned head falls across the wall. Roar!)

[Tunnels]

JAMIE: Doctor? Are you all right? What's happening? 
(Jamie throws down the end of the twine and starts down the right tunnel, but immediately the sound of the clockwork soldiers begins so he hides. One of the enters and stands in front of him.) 
JAMIE: Oh, so that's how you can see, is it? With that wee lighthouse of yours. 
(The Master of Fiction watches as Jamie ducks down.) 
(Jamie takes off his jacket. The soldier leans forward to see him. Jamie puts his jacket over its head.)

[Control room]

(The screen goes blank.) 
MASTER: No! Brainless idiot. Get yourself free. Don't let the boy escape. Forward. Forward. 
(In the tunnel, the soldier tips his head forward until the jacket falls off, then it heads off after Jamie.)

[Labyrinth centre]

ZOE: Doctor, it's moving. It's coming closer! 
(Roar!) 
ZOE: It's going to attack. 
DOCTOR: But Zoe, it's a legend. Another mythical beast, like the unicorn. 
ZOE: But it's there! 
DOCTOR: No! The Minotaur is a mythical beast. Say it. 
ZOE: The Minotaur is a mythical beast. It doesn't exist. 
(The roaring stops.) 
ZOE: It's gone. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I'm afraid we made it too difficult for it to stay. Come on, let's go and find Jamie.

[Tunnels]

ZOE: I think this is the place. 
DOCTOR: Yes. There's no sign of him. I'm sure he wouldn't have gone off without 
(Zoe picks up the jacket.) 
DOCTOR: What's that? 
ZOE: His jacket. 
DOCTOR: Well, he must be around here somewhere. 
ZOE: Jamie! Who's that? 
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, my dear sir. 
GULLIVER: Your servant, sir. 
DOCTOR: You have a knack of turning up unexpectedly. 
ZOE: Have you seen Jamie? 
GULLIVER: I walked alone, but saw no sign of any inhabitants. 
ZOE: Are you absolutely positive? 
GULLIVER: I would not impose any falsities upon you. I adhere strictly to truth. 
DOCTOR: Of course. This, er, this person who controls this place, the Master? 
GULLIVER: The Master, yes. 
DOCTOR: Have you seen him? 
GULLIVER: Upon occasion he has been pleased to grant me an audience. 
DOCTOR: Where might I find him? 
GULLIVER: The Master's palace is no ordinary edifice, but a citadel, a walled town at the top of a hill or cliff, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom. 
DOCTOR: Yes, now I think I understand. May I ask, sir, where you come from? Would it not be Nottingham? 
GULLIVER: My father had a small estate in Nottingham, sir. I was the third of five sons. He sent me to Emmanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen years old, where I applied myself close to my studies, learning navigation and other parts of the mathematics 
DOCTOR: Useful for those who intend to travel 
DOCTOR + GULLIVER: As I always believed it would someday or other, my fortune to do. 
DOCTOR: Now I know who you are, sir. Your name is Lemuel Gulliver. 
GULLIVER: Your servant. 
ZOE: Gulliver? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Oh, I'm looking forward to a long talk with you one of these days. 
GULLIVER: I should like that above all things, but it would not be proper at this juncture to trouble you with the particulars of my adventures. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn't dream of detaining you. 
GULLIVER: Having been condemned by nature and fortune to a restless and active life, I must take my leave of you. Farewell. 
DOCTOR: Farewell. 
(Gulliver leaves.) 
ZOE: Why does he talk in such an extraordinary way? 
DOCTOR: Well, he can only speak the words that Dean Swift gave him to say. 
ZOE: But that's ridiculous. I mean, there never was such a person as Gulliver. He's a fictional character. 
DOCTOR: Of course he is. Don't you understand? This world that we've tumbled into is a world of fiction. Unicorns, minotaur, Gulliver's travels, they're all alive here. 
ZOE: Then what are we doing here? What do they want with us? 
DOCTOR: I'm not sure I understand that yet. Come along, let's find Jamie. You'd better put this on. 
(The Doctor puts Jamie's jacket round Zoe's shoulders.)

[Cliff face]

(Jamie runs out of a cave into the open air with birdsong and sunlight. The clockwork soldier is still following so Jamie starts to scramble up the cliff where it cannot follow. After much effort he reaches a ledge part way up.) 
JAMIE: Oh, no. I'd need to be a human fly to get up that lot. I can't go back though. What I really need is a 
(A long plaited rope is thrown down to him.) 
JAMIE: Who says wishes don't come true. 
(The rope comes out of a Norman-style window in a round keep at the top of the cliff. As Jamie climbs the soldier gives up and leaves.)

[Outside the window]

JAMIE: So far, so good. Some sort of castle. Well, Jamie, now where? Well, you don't have much choice, do you? 
(Jamie pulls on the rope. A blonde girl in mediaeval dress comes to the window.) 
RAPUNZEL: Ouch! I suppose you know that hurts. 
JAMIE: You mean, this is your hair? 
RAPUNZEL: Of course. I don't object to people climbing it. I'm quite used to it, actually. But you would keep tugging so. 
JAMIE: Oh, I'm terribly sorry. 
RAPUNZEL: Are you a Prince? 
JAMIE: No. Why? 
RAPUNZEL: You're supposed to be. I'm a princess, but I suppose you knew that. My name is Rapunzel. You're not a woodcutter's son, by any chance? 
JAMIE: No, I'm the son of a piper. 
RAPUNZEL: Oh, how very disappointing. Well, in that case I think you'd better go. Goodbye. 
JAMIE: Your highness, wait. 
RAPUNZEL: Well? 
JAMIE: I can't go back there, it's a sheer drop, and well, I can't just stand out here. I'll have to climb though the window. 
RAPUNZEL: Oh. Well, I don't know if that will be allowed. 
JAMIE: Well, I won't stay long. Just passing through, you might say. Och, please. 
RAPUNZEL: It's a great pity you're not a prince. You'd have made rather a good one. Well, I suppose you'd better come inside. For goodness sake be quiet.

[Citadel]

(Jamie climbs into a white room. Rapunzel has vanished.) 
JAMIE: Rapunzel? Your highness, where have you gone? Don't be silly, I'm not going. 
(Jamie walks down a some steps. There are strange metal devices sticking out of the wall.) 
JAMIE: Hey, this doesn't look like the inside of a princess's castle to me. 
(In the lower room there are futuristic devices and a large oval screen. Jamie switches it on and the first page of Treasure Island appears. He turns it off, then accidentally switches on another machine.) 
FEMALE: 'Christmas won't be Christmas without presents,' grumbled Jo, lying on the rug. 'It's so dreadful to be poor,' sighed Meg, looking down at her old robe. 
(Jamie switches off Little Women and goes over to a wall with labelled flashing lights. Vanity Fair, Don Quixote, The Pit and the Pendulum, Swallows and Amazons. A tickertape machine labelled 'Work in Progress' rattles. Jamie reads it.) 
JAMIE: The Doctor and Zoe, unable to find their companion in the labyrinth, decide to return to the cave in search of him, where a new terror awaited them.

[Labyrinth centre]

DOCTOR: I imagine there must be at least one more test. I wonder what it'll be? 
ZOE: I believe you're actually beginning to enjoy all this. That wasn't there before, was it? 
(That is a life-sized statue of a woman with large blank eyes, snakes around her neck and snakes for hair.) 
DOCTOR: A statue. 
ZOE: Like the unicorn. 
DOCTOR: Yes, only the unicorn was alive first and then became a statue. Only this time 
ZOE: What? 
DOCTOR: Have a care, Zoe. I have a feeling the situation is going to be reversed. 
ZOE: It is coming to life! 
(The statue's snake-hair begins to hiss and writhe.) 
DOCTOR: Medusa!

[Citadel]

(We pan up from the label 'Legends of Ancient Greece'. Jamie is still reading from the ticker-tape machine.) 
JAMIE: The Doctor and Zoe were face to face with Medusa. One glance from her eyes would turn them to stone!

[Labyrinth centre]

(The Doctor and Zoe are trying not to look at Medusa as she approaches them.) 
DOCTOR: Now, we know what we have to do, Zoe. 
ZOE: Yes. She's moving. She's going to look at us. 
DOCTOR: Zoe, we have to say Medusa doesn't exist. 
ZOE: But she does! 
DOCTOR: Zoe, Medusa is a myth. If you believe it her, she can turn us both to stone. Now, Zoe, say it. The Medusa is a myth. Say it! 
(Medusa's outstretched hand touches Zoe's face.) 
ZOE: But she's alive! 
DOCTOR: No! 
ZOE: She's real 
DOCTOR: No, don't look in her eyes. Don't look!

Episode Four

[Labyrinth centre]

DOCTOR: The Medusa does not exist. You must believe that. 
ZOE: I can feel her fingertips, like ice. 
DOCTOR: No, no, that's marble. Think of her as a marble statue. A legend. 
ZOE: But she's real. I've got to look at her, I've got to.

[Citadel]

JAMIE: (reading) One glance from her eyes would turn them to stone, but all was not yet lost. Suddenly the Doctor found a sword at his feet, picked it up, and with one stroke slew the monster.

[Labyrinth centre]

DOCTOR: A sword! 
ZOE: Well, that's it. You're meant to use the sword like Perseus. 
DOCTOR: Maybe it's another trap? 
ZOE: Oh, Doctor, please! 
DOCTOR: No. How can I kill something that doesn't exist? 
(The Doctor drops the sword.) 
ZOE: I've got to open my eyes. I've got to see. 
DOCTOR: No, wait. Perseus, of course. A mirror. There. Look at her reflection in the mirror. Look. Can you see her? 
ZOE: Yes. 
DOCTOR: This is how Perseus escaped. He looked at her reflection in his polished shield. There's no danger in the reflection. 
(Medusa's snakes stop writhing and hissing.) 
DOCTOR: It's safe now. You can look now. The statue has become a statue again.

[Citadel]

JAMIE: (reading) Cancel. Cancel. Cancel. The Doctor test, report failure. Failure? 
(Jamie walks away past the window he came in through towards another doorway. There he breaks a light beam and an alarm sounds, making him jump back. A grill comes down across the window. He returns to the story room.) 
MASTER [OC]: Attention! Attention! There is a stranger inside the building. Call out the search party. 
(Gulliver enters.) 
GULLIVER: Ah, the young traveller. I had wondered as much. 
JAMIE: Have you been sent to find me? 
GULLIVER: His companions were in a state of some anxiety concerning his present whereabouts. 
JAMIE: Companions! Zoe and the Doctor, where are they? 
GULLIVER: Safe and well. 
JAMIE: You've actually spoken to them? 
GULLIVER: The gentlemen desired I let him know what place I came from and whither I was bound. 
JAMIE: Oh. What's that? 
(A mechanical buzzing noise.) 
GULLIVER: I heard nothing. 
JAMIE: Probably that search party. 
GULLIVER: By the laws of this kingdom, every chamber must be searched. 
JAMIE: If they find me, I'm done for. 
GULLIVER: You should be put to death. 
(Jamie leans against the wall and the panel slides aside, tumbling him back into a recess.) 
JAMIE: What about you? 
GULLIVER: I shall come to no harm. 
JAMIE: If you give me away this time, I'm finished. 
(Jamie goes into the recess and slides the panel back. Gulliver draws his sword and has his flintlock pistol ready.) 
GULLIVER: I was ready with the hazard of my life to defend this person. 
(Three White Robots come down the steps. They walk past Gulliver, who does not see them, and through a panel at the far end of the room. Jamie comes out.) 
JAMIE: Where've they gone? 
GULLIVER: Hmm? 
JAMIE: The white robots? 
GULLIVER: Young sir, I do assure you there were no such persons here. 
JAMIE: Aye, well, robots or not, I'm getting out of this place. 
(Jamie tries to force the grill at the window.) 
GULLIVER: You desire your liberty. 
JAMIE: Yes. I mean, I got in all right. The thing is, how do I get out? 
GULLIVER: After some consideration. 
JAMIE: Yes? 
GULLIVER: I was of the opinion that 
JAMIE: Go on, go on. 
GULLIVER: This was altogether impossible.

[Cliff face]

(There is a full Disney-style castle on a mountaintop.) 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, that's the citadel all right. The question is, how do we get up there. 
ZOE: It's an awful long way to climb. 
DOCTOR: Zoe, duck! 
(They hide and something makes a rock behind them go bang.) 
ZOE: The Karkus. 
(A comic-book character in black tights and exaggerated torso and arm muscles. He wears a mask and cape, is holding a ray gun, and speaks with a Teutonic accent.) 
KARKUS: You are my prisoners. 
ZOE: It's the Karkus. 
DOCTOR: What? 
KARKUS: You will come out and put ze hand above ze head. 
ZOE: You know. He's fictional, too. 
KARKUS: Obey, or I fire. 
(The Doctor and Zoe raise their hands.) 
DOCTOR: What, with that thing? What sort of a gun is that? 
ZOE: It's an anti-molecular ray disintegrator. 
DOCTOR: Rubbish. Such a weapon is scientifically impossible. It doesn't exist. 
(The ray gun vanishes and Karkus snarls.) 
DOCTOR: Well, that seems to take care of that, doesn't it. 
KARKUS: I shall tear you limb from limb. 
ZOE: Oh, Doctor, be careful. He could do it, you know. The Karkus has super-human strength. 
KARKUS: You will be minced meats. 
ZOE: Quickly, Doctor, say it. You know he's a fictional character. 
DOCTOR: But I don't. I've never heard of him. 
(The Karkus swings at the Doctor, who ducks.) 
DOCTOR: Oh Zoe, run! 
(Karkus lifts Zoe out of the way.) 
DOCTOR: What are you doing? No, please, I'm sure we can talk this over. 
(Zoe grabs Karkus' right hand and throws him.) 
DOCTOR: Zoe. 
ZOE: Lesson seventeen. 
DOCTOR: Be careful. 
ZOE: Oh dear. 
(Again Zoe ducks under Karkus' arm, grabs it and throws him.) 
ZOE: Lesson thirty two. 
(The Doctor tries to throw the character too, but fails. Zoe kicks the Karkus' bottom and he nearly falls on the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: Don't do anything rash. 
(Zoe repeatedly throws Karkus until she finally gets him on the ground in a headlock.) 
KARKUS: Mercy. 
ZOE: You'd better submit, you know. 
KARKUS: Have mercy. 
ZOE: Your neck can only take a certain amount of pressure. Do you submit? 
KARKUS: I submit. 
ZOE: That's better. 
KARKUS: I am your slave. Command me. 
ZOE: Do you know the way to the Citadel? 
KARKUS: I know it. 
DOCTOR: Well, well take us there, there's a good chap. 
(Zoe snaps her fingers.) 
KARKUS: I obey. 
ZOE: We all follow his adventures in the strip sections of the hourly telepress. 
DOCTOR: The strip? Oh, a strip cartoon of the year two thousand? 
ZOE: You've been in the year two thousand, haven't you? 
DOCTOR: Yes, but I hardly had time to follow the strip cartoons. 
ZOE: Well, you better start following this one. He's half way up that cliff. Come on.

[Outside the Citadel]

(A sturdy wooden door with a small grille in the centre. The Doctor is wearing Karkus' cape.) 
DOCTOR: Well thank you, thank you, Mister. What did you say his name was? 
ZOE: K A R K U S. 
DOCTOR: Ah yes, Mister Karkus. Thank you. 
ZOE: We won't be needing you any longer. Run along. 
KARKUS: I obey. 
(The Karkus leaves.) 
DOCTOR: Come along. 
ZOE: We can't just ring the bell and ask to go in. 
DOCTOR: Why not? It's the usual way. 
ZOE: Oh, Doctor, are you sure this is a good idea? 
(The panel behind the grille slides open but we can only see blackness inside.) 
MASTER [OC]: State your name and attribution. 
(The Doctor hides Zoe under the cape.) 
DOCTOR: I am ze Karkus. 
MASTER [OC]: And your attribution? 
ZOE: What's that? 
DOCTOR: Shush. Year two thousand, comic strip creation, the hourly telepress. 
MASTER [OC]: Authenticated. You may enter.

[Citadel]

(Jamie is checking the door the White Robots went through.) 
JAMIE: Come on, now. You heard them giving orders to look for me. Why do you suppose that happened? 
GULLIVER: I conjecture that these were orders given by some person in authority. 
JAMIE: The Master? 
GULLIVER: It is possible. 
JAMIE: Oh, now I'm getting somewhere. Now listen, if there aren't any robots, who do you think was carrying out those orders? I mean, who was I hiding from? 
GULLIVER: Why, sir, the Yahoos. 
JAMIE: Who's the Yahoos? 
GULLIVER: A cursed race of inferior creatures. I never beheld so disagreeable an animal. 
JAMIE: Well, I haven't seen any Yahoos. You haven't seen any robots. A fine pickle we're all in. 
ZOE: Jamie! 
DOCTOR: What happened? 
JAMIE: No! No! Stay where you are! 
(The Doctor and Zoe stop before they break the beam in the doorway, which is about eighteen inches off the ground.) 
JAMIE: There's an electrical gadget round here somewhere which sets off an alarm gong. I walked through it, the gong went off and they set a gang of robots after me. 
ZOE: Robots? You mean the same ones that we saw before? 
JAMIE: Aye, the big white ones, aye. 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, did you hear that? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I thought they'd turn up sooner or later. Yes, it's a simple photoelectric cell. We just. I'd better lift you over it. 
JAMIE: Be careful. 
DOCTOR: There we are. 
(The Doctor puts Zoe down the other side of the arch then jumps over the beam.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, my word. 
(Zoe gives Jamie his jacket and he puts it on.) 
ZOE: Oh Jamie, what happened to you when you left the tunnel? 
JAMIE: I was chased by one of those tin soldiers. Luckily, I climbed up the cliff up here. Hey, the thing is, how do we get out? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm not leaving yet. I'm here on business. 
ZOE: No, the Doctor's made up his mind. He's going to see the Master. 
GULLIVER: This resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous. 
ZOE: There you are, you see? 
DOCTOR: Why do you say that? 
GULLIVER: I think you should not be here. The Master makes rules for the government of his Kingdom. It is unwise for you to disobey. 
ZOE: So you think we shouldn't try and see the Master. 
GULLIVER: If you would take my advice, swear a peace with the Master and his kingdom. Find yourselves a place to lodge, stay quietly with the expectation that things would mend. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, I see. I'll think it over very carefully. 
GULLIVER: Your servant. (to Zoe) Your servant. 
(Gulliver leaves.) 
JAMIE: You're not really going to do as he says, are you? 
DOCTOR: No, of course not. I said I'd think it over. Well, I've thought it over. We're staying on and fighting on. 
ZOE: But we'll be fighting on in the dark. We don't know where the next attack will come from. Medusa was bad enough. 
JAMIE: Ah, Medusa. Yes, I read about that on this machine here. Wee words keep coming out of it all the time. 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes? 
JAMIE: Look. 
DOCTOR: Let's have a look. 
JAMIE: There. Look. 
DOCTOR: (reads.) Cancel. Doctor test report failure. Oh, I think I'm beginning to understand. 
JAMIE: Well, I wish I was. 
DOCTOR: Well, when someone writes about an incident after it's happened, that is history. 
JAMIE: Yes. 
DOCTOR: But when the writing comes first, that's fiction. If we'd have fallen into the Master's trap, we would have become fiction. 
ZOE: Oh that's horrible. Come on, let's get out of here. 
DOCTOR: Zoe, where are you going? 
ZOE: Before it's too late. 
DOCTOR: Don't go 
ZOE: It's all right 
DOCTOR: No, not through there! (Zoe walks through the archway and the alarm sounds.) 
JAMIE: Oh no. 
MASTER [OC]: Attention. There are still strangers at large. Renew the search. The strangers must be found. 
ZOE: What are we going to do? 
JAMIE: I mean, that's funny. Gulliver walked through there. 
DOCTOR: Gulliver's not real, we are. 
ZOE: They're coming. Where can we hide? 
DOCTOR: No need to hide. 
ZOE: Why not? If they find us? 
DOCTOR: Let them find us. 
JAMIE: You mean, just stand here and wait? 
DOCTOR: Yes, why not? We'll ask for an interview with the Master. 
ZOE: They may not give us time to ask for anything. 
JAMIE: Look! 
(Three white robots have entered.) 
DOCTOR: Are you looking for us by any chance? We demand an interview with the Master. 
(The door Jamie was examining earlier opens.) 
MASTER [OC]: How very fortunate. Do come in, Doctor. I've been expecting you. Oh, don't be alarmed. Won't you walk into my parlour? 
DOCTOR: Said the spider to the fly. Come along.

[Control room]

JAMIE: It's hard to see anything. 
DOCTOR: Where are you? 
MASTER: Here, patiently waiting. 
(A door of hexagonal glass panels opens and Zoe, Jamie and the Doctor enter. A White Robot stands guard. The Master seats at his console, and now we see his face we can also see a large glass globe with filaments spinning behind him. The Master is an elderly bearded gentleman in velvet jacket and skull cap, wearing half-moon reading glasses. The skull cap has wires connecting it to the globe.) 
MASTER: Oh Doctor, this is a great pleasure. And your two young companions. Now let me see. Oh yes, yes, yes. Zoe and Jamie. I have your dossiers here in front of me. 
ZOE: You appear to be very well organised. 
MASTER: Oh yes, indeed. We have to be. The running of this place requires enormous attention to detail. It's a responsible position, but very rewarding. 
DOCTOR: Responsible, huh? To someone else? 
MASTER: Not to someone. Another power. Higher than you could begin to imagine. Oh, I must congratulate you on the great skill in which you tackled the various stages of your examination. 
DOCTOR: What is the purpose of all these tests? 
MASTER: Well, do you know, when I was first brought here myself, I was as bewildered as you are. 
JAMIE: Well, how long have you been here? 
MASTER: I left England in the summer of nineteen twenty six. It was a very hot day, I remember. I think I must have dozed off over my desk, and when I awoke. Oh, but that' a long story. Did you ever hear of the Adventures of Captain Jack Harkaway? 
(written by Frank Richards, a pseudonym of Charles Harold St. John Hamilton.) 
DOCTOR: No, I can't say that I. Wait a minute, a serial in a boys' magazine? 
MASTER: The Ensign. 
DOCTOR: The Ensign. 
MASTER: And for twenty five years, I delivered five thousand words every week. 
DOCTOR: You are a writer. 
ZOE: Twenty-five years, five thousand words a week. Well, that's well over half a million words. 
MASTER: Yes, yes. It was probably some kind of record. Anyway, that was why I was selected to work here. 
JAMIE: And you're the one that's in charge of all of this? 
MASTER: In one sense, yes. 
DOCTOR: Or is all this in charge of you? 
MASTER: My brain is the source of the creative power which keeps this operation going. 
DOCTOR: I see. That means that you are virtually a prisoner. 
MASTER: Oh, no. No, no, no. 
(The globe glows.) 
MASTER: You, you, you must excuse me for a moment. 
(The Master writes in a large book. We see Resistance is Useless underlined at the top of the page, then Submit your will for the...) 
JAMIE: Come on, Doctor, let's get out of here. 
ZOE: Yes, let's. It gives me the creeps. 
DOCTOR: No, I need to find out more. 
JAMIE: Well, look, you keep him talking, and Zoe and me will find another way out. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, I think it will be safer if we all stick together. 
(The globe stops glowing and the Master stops writing.) 
MASTER: Oh, I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting. Now, where were we? 
DOCTOR: You were about to answer my question. Are you a prisoner here? 
MASTER: Well, no. No, I wouldn't say that. In fact, I rather like being here. I have everything I could possibly want. 
(Jamie and Zoe sneak round the back of the globe.) 
MASTER: This vast library with all the known works of fiction. All the masterpieces written by Earthmen since the beginning of time.

[Library]

(Jamie and Zoe enter a room full of bookcases.) 
ZOE: I don't think he noticed. 
JAMIE: No. Let's try down there.

[Control room]

DOCTOR: I see, yes. And only an Earthman type creature has the power to create fiction. The power to imagine. 
MASTER: Exactly. This is one field in which the intelligence I serve cannot compete. They need man, a man of boundless imagination, as a powerhouse. A lifeline, as you might say. 
DOCTOR: What is this intelligence you serve, and why was I brought me here? 
MASTER: Well, as you see, I'm no longer young, where as you, Doctor, are ageless. You exist outside the barriers of time and space. 
DOCTOR: And you want me to 
MASTER: To take over this unique situation. To take my place. 
DOCTOR: I refuse! 
(The globe glows and takes over the Master.) 
MASTER: Refusal is impossible. You are here to serve us. There is no alternative.

[Library]

ZOE: We've got to find a way out of here. 
JAMIE: There must be a door somewhere. Look, if we're going to get the Doctor away 
ZOE: Jamie! 
(It's a White Robot. Another one comes from behind. They try to run and a third blocks them.) 
JAMIE: No. Back this way.

[Control room]

MASTER: Resistance is useless. Submit your will for the sake of the greater good. It has been decided. 
DOCTOR: I refuse. I shall make that decision for myself. 
(The globe stops and the Master returns to normal.) 
THE MASTER: You will find there is only one decision open to you. Mission accomplished. Procedure as arranged. 
DOCTOR: What does that mean? 
MASTER: The latest chapter of the serial story. I'll read you the last sentence. Zoe and Jamie attempted to escape, but in making it through the library they were ambushed by a party of guards and were overpowered. 
DOCTOR: Oh, no. Jamie! Zoe! 
THE MASTER: Are you prepared to cooperate now? Your life in return for theirs? Is that a bargain? Look!

[Library]

(The White Robots are using their chest units on Zoe and Jamie.) 
ZOE: Oh Jamie, my eyes. 
JAMIE: I can't see. Where are you? Quick, back, back away. Zoe, here, Quick. 
(Jamie leads Zoe between the pages of an open book. The chapter heading is 'Un Renard - Pris au piece' and it is written in French.) 
JAMIE: No, it's a book. Back out again. 
(The Robots close the book.) 
ZOE: Push. 
JAMIE: Push. Open up. It's closing. No!

[Episode Five]

[Control room]

(The Doctor has watched this on a monitor.) 
DOCTOR: What have you done to them? 
MASTER: They're no longer human beings, just fictional characters. Now, if you consent to take my place here, they can be released. 
DOCTOR: You really would do that? 
MASTER: No, my dear sir, you would. Once you have taken up your post here, it could be your first official task as the new controller. 
DOCTOR: I see. How very ingenious. 
MASTER: I take it then that you agree? 
DOCTOR: No! My answer is still no! 
MASTER: How very unfortunate. 
(Two White Robots enter through the glass door, and a third from somewhere else.) 
MASTER: I'm sorry to have to use violent methods, but you must submit. You have no alternative. 
DOCTOR: I have yet to see a robot that can climb. 
(The Doctor climbs up a bookcase.) 
MASTER: You cannot escape. But we will play your game a little longer. 
(The Doctor comes out of a small ornate window over a crenellation onto a battlement proper. A door creaks.)

[Battlement]

ZOE: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Oh, Zoe! Jamie! 
JAMIE: Oh, am I glad to see you. 
DOCTOR: The Master said you been turned into 
JAMIE: Aye, where do we go from here? 
ZOE: Well, back to the Tardis. 
JAMIE: We can't do that. It fell apart, do you not remember? 
ZOE: Oh well, it's all over now, thank goodness. 
JAMIE: The Tardis broke up! 
DOCTOR: Yes, you've said that, Jamie. 
ZOE: I'm tired, I think I'll sit down and have a rest. 
DOCTOR: Is some thing wrong, Zoe? 
JAMIE: Aye, well, where do we go from here? 
ZOE: Back to the Tardis. 
JAMIE: We can't do that. It broke up. Do you not remember? 
DOCTOR: But you keep saying the same things. 
(The Doctor snaps his fingers in front of Jamie.) 
JAMIE: The Tardis broke up. 
DOCTOR: Then it's true. They're not real. They've been turned into fiction. 
(A little way along the battlement -) 
DOCTOR: Well, what's this? 
(It's a skylight. The Doctor cleans the glass and looks straight down onto a typewriter, and the words 'They were ambushed by a party of white robots and overpowered.) 
DOCTOR: The master tape! I wonder. Perhaps if I were to create a few immortal words of fiction of my own. Yes, it's worth trying. 
(The Doctor can't open the skylight.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, what I need is the strength of Karkus! 
KARKUS: I am at your command. 
DOCTOR: Oh thank you, my dear sir. Perhaps you could release this for me. 
(The Karkus lifts out the skylight frame.) 
KARKUS: Zis is want you want? 
DOCTOR: Well no, I don't actually want it. You see, I want to get down here somehow. 
KARKUS: Ah. Wait. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. 
(The Karkus leaves with the frame.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie. Jamie, Zoe. You are being controlled! Jamie, listen. Listen! Oh, it's no use. 
KARKUS: A rope. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. 
RAPUNZEL: Ouch. Careful. 
DOCTOR: Oh! Oh yes, of course, you are the Princess Rapunzel. 
RAPUNZEL: Are you a prince? 
DOCTOR: No. No, I'm afraid not, but would you mind if I used your hair to get down there. 
RAPUNZEL: No, of course not. Everybody else uses it, so I don't see why you shouldn't. 
DOCTOR: Thank you very much. Now then, where can we attach the? 
(The Karkus holds the plait.) 
DOCTOR: Ah yes, of course.

[Tape room]

(The Doctor climbs down Rapunzel's plait into a room very similar to the one with the tickertape machine. He goes to the machine and starts typing.)

[Control room]

The Master watches him on a monitor. We see the words 'for their escape. Enemy had finally been defeated) 
MASTER: Yes, yes. Go on.

[Tape room]

DOCTOR: "The enemy had been finally defeated by the Doctor. No, no, I can't say that. If I say that. I nearly fell for it, didn't I. Another two seconds and I should have turned myself into fiction! 
(A clockwork soldier is standing near him.)

[Control room]

(The Master watches as the Doctor climbs back up Rapunzel's plait.) 
MASTER: Halt! Now we shall play games no longer.

[Battlements]

DOCTOR: I'm very obliged to you both. 
RAPUNZEL: Always happy to be of assistance. 
DOCTOR: Jamie and Zoe. I left them here. Where are they? Jamie! Zoe! 
(Gulliver and the 'Treasure Seekers' children enter.) 
GULLIVER: They had to make a departure. It was necessary. 
OSWALD: They'll be back soon. 
DORA: What's been happening? 
HORACE: You must have some idea? 
ALICE: Is it a game? 
CHILDREN: Yes. What's going on? 
DOCTOR: Please, please. I must think. There must be some way out of this. There's just got to be.

[Control room]

(The Master reads what he has just written.) 
MASTER: Jamie and Zoe realised at last that the Doctor was in fact the most monstrous and cunning villain. There was no punishment too severe for the crimes that he had committed. 
(Jamie and Zoe enter with two White Robots.) 
MASTER: Splendid. Splendid. Come closer, my children. 
JAMIE: You sent for us, Master? 
MASTER: Now you know what your friend the Doctor is really like, don't you. 
ZOE: He is the most monstrous and cunning villain. 
JAMIE: No punishment is too severe for the crimes he has committed. 
MASTER: Word perfect. That is why I have sent for you both at this moment of crisis. We need your help. 
ZOE: Tell us what we must do. 
MASTER: Well

[Battlements]

(The smaller children are playing Ring a Rosie.) 
CHILDREN: A pocket full of posies. A-tishoo, a-tishoo, we all fall down. 
GULLIVER: I understand, sir, that you are in an unhappy situation. 
RAPUNZEL: Isn't there anything we can do to help? 
DOCTOR: I only wish there was. 
DORA: Look! 
OSWALD: What's that? 
DICKY: I never saw it before. 
DOCTOR: The Tardis, safe and sound, by all that's wonderful. 
(Jamie comes out.) 
JAMIE: Doctor, are you ready? 
(Zoe come out.) 
ZOE: The time has come. 
DOCTOR: The time? 
ZOE: To leave. 
DOCTOR: But how did you find the Tardis? 
JAMIE: Oh, we'll explain all that later. 
ZOE: Come on, we must get away. 
DOCTOR: Yes! Yes of course we must. Just as I was thinking that all was over. 
ZOE: Oh, no. 
(Jamie pushes the Doctor into the Tardis and locks the door.) 
JAMIE: It's not over yet, Doctor. 
ZOE: Not yet. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Oh, Jamie! Zoe! 
(The Tardis is a cardboard cutout, which falls to reveal the Doctor trapped inside a plastic cube. The children laugh.) 
DOCTOR: What's happening? 
(The cube and Doctor disappear.)

[Control room]

MASTER: The children obeyed perfectly. Their mission is completed. 
(The Doctor is in a transparent panel with a device over his head, with similar features to the robot's chest panels.) 
MASTER: And now perhaps we can get down to business. As you refused to take over my post at the controls, we have been forced to incorporate you into the computer itself. 
DOCTOR: To what purpose? 
MASTER: To bring the whole planet Earth under our control. 
DOCTOR: And it's people? 
MASTER: We have no wish to destroy them. Merely adjust their minds to suit our purpose. 
DOCTOR: Sausages. Man will just become like a string of sausages, all the same. 
MASTER: Man will simply vanish from the Earth and reappear here. 
DOCTOR: Leaving the Earth undamaged and uninhabited for you to take over. 
MASTER: Precisely. 
DOCTOR: If I cooperate. 
MASTER: You have no alternative. You are part of the Master Brain. 
DOCTOR: So the computer feeds off my thoughts, does it? 
MASTER: Correct. 
DOCTOR: Then it will create what I think. 
MASTER: Oh, no. No, no, no, no. You're now under the control of the Master Brain. 
DOCTOR: Are you so sure? You couldn't control my mind before, and you certainly can't control it now. 
MASTER: Submit! 
DOCTOR: No! You've given me equal power. It's now a battle of wits between me and you. 
(The Doctor concentrates hard.) 
MASTER: Oh, no. No, no! Stop! Stop! 
DOCTOR: Jamie, Zoe, can you hear me? Think for yourselves. Don't be afraid. You can open the book. Go on, you can do it. 
MASTER: Oh, oh dear. This is against everything we ever worked for. Warning! Warning! Emergency Action. Emergency! Emergency! 
DOCTOR: Don't worry about fiction. Hang on to real life. You've got to get out. 
MASTER: Calling White Robots. Guards will enter the control centre. The Master Brain must be protected.

[Battlements]

OSWALD: What is it? 
DORA: What are you saying? 
HORACE: Is it a game? 
GULLIVER: We are no longer in the same service. 
RAPUNZEL: You're going away from us. 
(Jamie and Zoe walk slowly away.)

[Book]

JAMIE: Push, Zoe. Push hard. We will get out.

[Control room]

(The Master watches Jamie and Zoe push the pages apart.) 
MASTER: Soldiers. To the roof, immediately. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, Zoe, concentrate. You've got to get out of there. Now push. Harder! Harder! 
(The monitor shows Jamie and Zoe leave the book, then it goes blank.) 
DOCTOR: Splendid, splendid. 
MASTER: Soldiers, forward. Seize them, destroy them. 
DOCTOR: No! Jamie, Zoe, run!

[Battlements]

(Clockwork soldiers approach.) 
JAMIE: Back, Zoe. 
ZOE: Can't you help us? 
GULLIVER: We obey our creator. That is all that is expected of any character, unless the Master bids us otherwise.

[Control room]

MASTER: And now Doctor, obey me. 
DOCTOR: No! Suddenly, the Karkus came to their rescue!

[Battlements]

KARKUS: I am at you command. 
DOCTOR [OC]: He raised his anti-molecular disintegrator gun and destroyed the soldiers.
(Which he does.)

[Control room]

MASTER: No! But the Karkus realised his mistake and turned back to face his real enemies, Jamie and Zoe.

[Battlements]

JAMIE: What's he doing? Duck, Zoe!

[Control room]

MASTER: With Jamie and Zoe fixed firmly in his sights, the Karkus pressed the trigger of his gun. 
DOCTOR: But all the power had been used up on the soldiers and it was useless. Oh, you'll have to do better than that. 
MASTER: Suddenly a swashbuckling figure appeared. Poet and swordsman,

[Battlements]

MASTER [OC]: The famous Cyrano de Bergerac. Remorselessly, Cyrano advanced on those that had dared poke fun at his nose.

[Control room]

DOCTOR: But wait.

[Battlements]

DOCTOR [OC]: He found himself face to face with the fearless musketeer and fearless swordsman D'Artagnan. 
(The swordfight begins, with stirring background music. They are evenly matched.)

[Control room]

DOCTOR: Jamie, Zoe, get away from there.

[Battlements]

JAMIE: Come on, Zoe. Princess Rapunzel, can we borrow you hair again? 
RAPUNZEL: Of course. 
ZOE: Why are we going down there? 
JAMIE: We've got to find the Doctor. Come on.

[Control room]

MASTER: Stop them. Substitute cutlass for rapier. Cancel

[Battlements]

MASTER [OC]: Cancel Cyrano. Blackbeard the pirate. 
(D'Artangan is disarmed by the bigger weapon.) 
DOCTOR [OC]: Cancel D'Artagnan. Substitute Sir Lancelot in full armour. 
(Blackbeard takes a swing at the mounted knight's sword then falls to his knees begging for mercy.)

[Tape room]

JAMIE: This way.

[Control room]

(The Master has a conversation with the controlling computer.) 
MASTER: The Doctor is expendable. Expendable. He will be destroyed. Oh, no, no. He's the only person. There's nobody else. I can't go on for ever. Oh, please, please give me another chance. You have failed. The Master Brain must be protected against overloading. Robot force will deal with him. 
(Three White Robots appear.) 
MASTER: Change robot weapon to destructor beam. 
(The Robot's chest units opens to reveal the weapon. Jamie and Zoe hide behind the globe.) 
MASTER: Remove him. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh my goodness. As the White Robots advanced on the Doc. No, I can't say that. I can't say that. 
MASTER: No, Doctor, you can't save yourself this time. Bring him out. 
(The White Robots close in on the Doctor. One reaches out for him. Meanwhile, crouched behind the Master Brain, Jamie and Zoe watch on.) JAMIE: Zoe, what can we do? We cant fight those brutes. 
ZOE: No, Jamie, but the computer, it must control everything here, the robots included. And the Master said it must be protected against overloading. 
(There are now four White Robots and the Doctor is free of the head device. ) 
MASTER: It is a pity that we have to destroy such an intelligent mind as yours, Doctor, but you leave us no alternative. Disintegrate. 
(As the White Robots charge up their weapons, Zoe goes to a console and pushes every button. Jamie joins in. On the monitor the unicorn and the Medusa appear.) 
MASTER: Stop them. They will overload the Master Brain. Destroy them! Destroy! 
(The robots are frozen so the Doctor runs to the Master and pulls the connections from his skull cap. The old man collapses.) 
(The White Robots advance.) 
JAMIE: Zoe, let's get out of here and. Duck! 
(The Robots fire, hitting the computer console which bursts into flames.) 
DOCTOR: Zoe! Jamie! Oh my goodness. 
ZOE: Shouldn't we get out of here? 
DOCTOR: Yes. Come on, Jamie, give me hand with him. 
JAMIE: What do you want to bring him for? 
DOCTOR: Don't argue, Jamie. Give me hand. 
(The robots carry out their last instruction, to destroy, as Jamie and the Doctor carry the Master out.)

[Blackness]

JAMIE: I don't see why we had to bring him. He's the one that's caused all this trouble. 
DOCTOR: Are you all right, sir? 
MASTER: I'm not altogether sure where I am. Is this the office of the Ensign magazine? 
DOCTOR: No, you were kidnapped, just like we were. They've been using your mind. 
ZOE: Well, what happens to us now? 
DOCTOR: That depends how efficient the White Robots are. Their last order was to destroy. Let's just hope they're destroying one another. 
ZOE: Well, what about the Karkus and Gulliver and all our friends out there? 
DOCTOR: You can't blow up a fictional character, Zoe. 
JAMIE: Aye, but what about us though? 
DOCTOR: Well, we'll just have to hope that the destruction of the computer returns us all to reality. And you, my dear sir. 
MASTER: Oh, do you mean I'm going home? 
DOCTOR: Well, I hope so. 
ZOE: But surely it could just as well send us into oblivion. 
JAMIE: You mean we could vanish forever? 
DOCTOR: Well, we shall soon know. Hang on! Here it comes. 
(The Doctor, Jamie, Zoe and the Master disappear as the sound of explosions continues. We see the Tardis reassemble itself.)

[Tardis]

(The Tardis has reassembled itself and everyone is on board.) 
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, it's all right. It worked. 
DOCTOR: Jamie! You're right! We'd better just check, though. 
ZOE: Are we actually on our way, Doctor, or are we stuck somewhere? 
DOCTOR: Well, let's see shall we? 
(The Doctor switches on the scanner to show a cratered body in the foreground and a blue and white planet further away.) 
JAMIE: Where are we? What's that? 
ZOE: It's the moon, isn't it, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. That's the dark side of the moon. We seem to have stopped in space. 
ZOE: I remember seeing this before. 
DOCTOR: Shush, Zoe. That light on the Moon's surface. Do you see it? 
ZOE: Doctor! It's getting bigger! It's coming towards us! 
DOCTOR: Zoe, that's a missile! 
JAMIE: A what? 
ZOE: It's a missile? Somebody's fired a missile at us, Jamie! Oh Doctor, come on, let's get out of here. 
DOCTOR: Now don't fuss me, Zoe. 
ZOE: Well, what's happened? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's the landing circuit. It seems to have jammed. That's why we're stuck in space. Ah. 
(The Doctor pulls a lever off and thumps the console with it.) 
ZOE: We'll never make it! Oh, we're too late! 
DOCTOR: Oh, the stupid thing! Oh! 
(KaBOOM. The Tardis has vanished and something else flies away from where it was. In a peaceful pasture, a cow looks up as a disembodied blue flashing light appears above the ground, followed by a police box. In the Tardis, everyone gets up from the floor.) 
JAMIE: I think we've landed. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sorry about that, Jamie. Are you all right, Zoe? 
ZOE: Yes, I think so. 
JAMIE: Anyway, we weren't blown to pieces by that missile thing. 
ZOE: Why would anybody want to fire a missile at us? Surely they'd find out who we were first? 
DOCTOR: Yes. Unless they knew already. 
ZOE: The question is, was the object we saw on the other side of the moon in this time zone or not? 
JAMIE: You mean it could still be out there? 
DOCTOR: Yes, let's have a look. 
(The scanner shows a curious cow. They all laugh.) 
DOCTOR: We're certainly not on the moon's surface, are we. 
JAMIE: What's the matter with the Tardis, Doctor? It keeps going wrong all the time. 
DOCTOR: It merely needs an overhaul, Jamie, just like any piece of machinery. 
ZOE: Well, haven't you got any spares? 
DOCTOR: No, no. We shall have to see if we can get some made. Lets have a further look, shall we? 
(An electricity pylon.) 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, it could be twentieth century. England in summertime, I should say. See the rain clouds? We might try and look up our old friend Professor Travers in London. He might be able to help us. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Always supposing he's not a baby or a schoolboy. Now, come along. Let's just collect this circuit, and I think I'd better see this one. There. It's all right. It's just a fault in the visual stabiliser circuit. We'd better take that too. 
(The Tardis vanishes.) 
JAMIE: Doctor? Doctor? Where are you? 
DOCTOR: Come along, take my hand.

[Road]

(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe come out of the invisible Tardis and walk across the field to the road. I hope everyone remembers where they parked. A military style lorry comes along and the Doctor waves it down.) 
DOCTOR: I wonder if you could help us? 
MAN: Are you trying to get out? 
DOCTOR: We're trying to get to London. 
MAN: Get in. 
DOCTOR: Oh, that's very civil of you. 
MAN: Well shut up, will you, and get in. 
(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie climb into the back of the lorry. It drives off and two motorcycles follow. The driver sees them and after a short while has to pull over. He opens the tailgate.) 
DOCTOR: Is something wrong? 
MAN: Look, we'd better get clear of the lorry. Come on.

[Roadside]

(They hide in a small wood by the road.) 
JAMIE: What's happening? Why are we hiding? 
MAN: Company security were on my trail. 
ZOE: Which company? 
MAN: Come on, there's only one company. 
DOCTOR: Well, you see, we're strangers around here. 
MAN: Strangers? Then you're not from the community, then? 
DOCTOR: No. 
MAN: Then how did you get inside the compound? 
DOCTOR: Well, that's rather a long story. You see 
ZOE: This community you talked about, are they prisoners here then? 
MAN: Those who haven't gone over to the company are, yes. Not that they say you can't get out. They just make it pretty impossible without passes. 
JAMIE: You can move in and out. 
MAN: I got in all right. But getting out might be just a bit more difficult. 
DOCTOR: This company, what do they do? 
MAN: International Electromatics. Now surely you've heard of them? 
DOCTOR: Well, no, we've been a little out of touch. 
MAN: You must have been. They're the worlds biggest electronics manufacturers. You can hardly buy a piece of equipment that isn't theirs. Quick, get down. 
(Two motorcycles roar past.) 
ZOE: Well, what is this place, this compound? 
MAN: They set up a whole community of their own. Factories. Houses. A vast network of industrial complexes. All of the local people have been bought out. Most of them join the company. The others 
ZOE: What about them? 
MAN: My people haven't been able to trace them. 
DOCTOR: Your people? 
MAN: Should be safe now. We're not far from the guard post. You three had better stay out of sight in the lorry. I'll try and bluff our way out. Come on.

[Lorry]

(They come up to a gate in high chainlink fence topped with barbed wire, manned by uniformed armed guards.) 
JAMIE: We're slowing down. Must be the guard post now. 
ZOE: Yes, but why are we hiding like this? We've done nothing wrong. 
DOCTOR: We'll find out later. Keep down. 
(One guard checks the man's pass while another walks round the lorry. The man is allowed to drive on. Shortly afterwards, the motorcycle riders arrive.)

[Road]

(The lorry stops and the man opens the tailgate.) 
MAN: They're right behind us. 
DOCTOR: Oh, well, thank you very much. 
MAN: They're there in the distance. Now come on, get lost! 
(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie go behind the hedge and leave. The motorcycles pull up. The riders are wearing the same uniforms as the guards at the gate.) 
BIKER: Hey, you. I want to see your pass. You will come back with us for questioning. 
MAN: Oh come off it. That pass is in order, isn't it? 
BIKER: Don't argue! Follow us. 
MAN: Oh, no, I'm not going back inside that compound, and there's nothing you can do to make me. 
BIKER: You will come back with us. 
MAN: Look we're not on IE property now, you've no authority. 
(The bikers aim their pistols at him.) 
MAN: Sorry. You want to hold me, get onto the police. See you. 
(The bikers shoot the man. A little way away, the Doctor flags down a car.) 
DOCTOR: Can you give us a lift to London? 
CAMFIELD: Yes, I suppose so. 
(This is the director, Douglas Camfield.) 
DOCTOR: In you get. 
CAMFIELD: All right? 
(Zoe and Jamie get in the back, while the Doctor takes the passenger seat.) 
JAMIE: Thank you. Thank you very much. 
[Outside Travers' house]

(The Doctor goes up the steps to the front door of number 18, St James' Gardens.) 
DOCTOR: Here we are. Right. That's odd. It says Watkins. 
JAMIE: Must have the wrong house. 
DOCTOR: Well, the telephone directory definitely said number eighteen. We'll ask. 
(The Doctor rings the bell labelled Watkins several times, until the occupant, a young woman gets fed up and answers it.) 
ISOBEL: If you don't mind, I'm trying to work!

[Lounge]

DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry miss, but we wondered whether you could help us? We wondered if 
(Isobel takes a camera off its tripod.) 
ISOBEL: Oh look, the stupid thing's gone and jammed. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear. Perhaps I could help you. 
ISOBEL: Well, do you know anything about cameras? 
DOCTOR: Yes, a little. I see 
ISOBEL: Now, I had it on automatic shutter. 
DOCTOR: You're taking photos of yourself? 
ISOBEL: Yes, and then you interrupted me and the stupid thing jammed! Have you come to see my uncle? He's not here. But who are you? Friends of his? Fellow nuts? 
DOCTOR: Please let me answer one question at a time. 
ISOBEL: Hey, you be careful of that thing. It cost me a fortune. 
DOCTOR: It's all right, it's a very simple mechanism. Who is your uncle? 
ISOBEL: Professor Watkins. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Then Professor Travers doesn't live here? 
ISOBEL: Well, he did. He left about a month ago. Gone to America for a year with his daughter. 
JAMIE: Oh, that's just great. 
ISOBEL: My uncle worked at the Cavendish labs. He wanted to do some work so Professor Travers said he could use his daughter's lab here. And I moved in because I got kicked out of my studio last week.
DOCTOR: What field of science is your uncle in? 
ISOBEL: Oh, I don't know. He's in applied physics or something. Always messing around with computers and things. Complete nuts. 
DOCTOR: Well that is fortunate. Perhaps he might be able to help us. Is he at home? 
ISOBEL: No. 
DOCTOR: Well, where is he? 
ISOBEL: Well, how do I know? I'm not his keeper. Hey, have you fixed it? 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, that's all right. 
ISOBEL: That's really great. Thanks! 
DOCTOR: Miss. 
ISOBEL: (to Zoe) Hey! That's a jolly outfit. (the glitter catsuit) Would you mind posing for me? 
ZOE: What? 
ISOBEL: Look, just stand there. 
DOCTOR: Miss? 
ISOBEL: Isobel. Yeah. Now, just stand here. Head over the shoulder. 
DOCTOR: Have you any idea when your uncle is going to be back? 
ISOBEL: No, he left about a week ago, I haven't seen him since. 
JAMIE: A week? 
ISOBEL: Yeah, he was prattling on about some new invention, or something or other, and having the chance to develop it. Now. Not you. 
JAMIE: Oh. 
ISOBEL: Okay now, just 
DOCTOR: Can't you get in touch with him? 
ISOBEL: No, I tried. I wanted to borrow a couple of quid off him in a hurry, but well, they said he wasn't available for phone calls. 
DOCTOR: They? Now who is they? 
ISOBEL: Just get that, will you? I don't know. International Electric something or other. 
ZOE: International Electromatics? 
ISOBEL: Yes, probably. 
DOCTOR: You mean your uncle has gone to work for these people? Well, surely we can get in touch with him. 
ISOBEL: Well, you can try telephoning but I doubt if you'll get any joy. Phone's in the hall and the number's scribbled on the wall. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
(The Doctor and Jamie leave.) 
ISOBEL: Hey. Don't go. I don't often get the chance of photographing a real model. 
ZOE: Oh, all right. 
ISOBEL: Come on. Let's get you fixed up with some gear.

[Hallway]

(Jamie reads the number off the wall as the Doctor dials.) 
JAMIE: Three. 
DOCTOR: Three. 
JAMIE: Four. 
DOCTOR: Four. 
JAMIE: Two. 
DOCTOR: Two. 
JAMIE: Doctor, Do you suppose this firm could be the one that driver was talking about? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sure of it. 
JAMIE: In that case, Watkins could have been kidnapped! 
DOCTOR: Ah, Jamie. You mustn't let your imagination run away with you. I must admit, it's a bit strange. 
WOMAN [OC]: International Electromatics company. State your business. 
DOCTOR: I would like, please, to speak with Professor Watkins. 
WOMAN [OC]: One moment. (long pause) Party not available. 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, you see, but this is very important. 
WOMAN [OC]: Party not available. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but I must speak with him. 
WOMAN [OC]: Party not available. Party not available. 
DOCTOR: But this is an automatic answering device! Ah, shut up, you stupid machine! 
(The Doctor puts the phone down.) 
JAMIE: Now what? 
DOCTOR: There's only one thing for it. We'll have to go there ourselves.

[Lounge]

(Zoe is wearing a feather boa round her neck and a mini-pinafore dress now. Isobel is photographing her from below.) 
ISOBEL: Okay, that's fabulous. Just keep it like that. Great. 
(The Doctor and Jamie enter.) 
ISOBEL: Any luck? 
DOCTOR: No, it was stupid simple-minded computer answering service. 
ISOBEL: Well, what do we do now? 
DOCTOR: Jamie and I are going to this place. Come on, Zoe. 
ZOE: No, thanks. I think I'll stay here. It's great fun. 
JAMIE: You look like a chicken with all those feathers on! 
DOCTOR: Oh well, come on, Jamie. Oh, the address? 
ISOBEL: Oh, that's scribbled on the wall too. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. 
JAMIE: Do you not write anything down on paper at all? 
ISOBEL: Well, I'd only lose it if I did. Writing on a wall's much safer. You can't lose a wall, can you? 
JAMIE: No. 
ISOBEL: Okay, listen. Just put your boa round your head. Okay, now bring your eyes just into me. Okay.

[IE Reception]

(The Doctor and Jamie arrive at a large skyscraper - Millbank Tower actually - and enter the deserted reception area. There is one door labelled IE - no unauthorised entry - so the Doctor goes through. Outside, two men in a car watch them. The Doctor comes face to face with computer bank complete with magnetic tape and flashing lights.) 
DOCTOR: I thought so. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: More stupid computers. Automatic receptionists. Right. 
WOMAN: International Electromatic Company. State your business. 
DOCTOR: I would like, please, to speak with Professor Watkins. 
WOMAN: One moment. Party not available. 
DOCTOR: Then I would like to speak with someone in authority. 
WOMAN: Your request will be considered and your appointment arranged. Please state your name and address. 
DOCTOR: That's no good. I wish to speak with somebody now. 
WOMAN: I am sorry. All personnel are engaged. 
DOCTOR: But I insist. This is an emergency! 
WOMAN: State the nature of the emergency. 
DOCTOR: It's a private matter. 
WOMAN: Private matters have no emergency status. 
DOCTOR: Oh shut up, you stupid machine! Diabolical inventions. 
JAMIE: What now? 
DOCTOR: Come on. 
JAMIE: Where are we going? 
DOCTOR: Well, there must be somebody else in this building except these stupid machines. Come on. 
(The Doctor and Jamie go out and down a back alley, watched by security cameras.)

[Outside IE]

(In the car.) 
BENTON: HQ are checking now. Where are they? 
TRACY: Gone round the back, down the side alley. 
BENTON: That's a dead end, isn't it? So they've got to come out this way. 
TRACY: If they come out.

[Vaughn's office]

(A silver haired man - Vaughn - is watching the Doctor and Jamie on a monitor.) 
PACKER: Well? 
VAUGHN: The same two? 
PACKER: Yeah. 
VAUGHN: Deal with them. 
(Packer leaves. Vaughn presses a button as Jamie and the Doctor step out of a lift. Gas pours out of a nozzle, filling the corridor, and they collapse.)

[Outside IE]

(In the car.) 
BENTON: Okay lets move. 
TRACY: HQ? 
BENTON: Yes, they've run a check. They want these two. Priority. 
TRACY: Right, let's get 'em.

[Corridor]

(Packer and guards come out of the lift and take hold of the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: Wait! 
PACKER: (raising his fist.) This will be my pleasure. 
VAUGHN [on monitor]: Packer! Bring them to my office. 
PACKER: But Mister Vaughn, I haven't interrogated them yet. 
VAUGHN [on monitor]: Packer, please do as I say. 
PACKER: Yes, sir. Come on. This way.

[Vaughn's office]

(Sunlight streams through the vertical blinds.) 
VAUGHN: Come and sit down, gentlemen. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
VAUGHN: You can go, Packer. 
PACKER: But Mister Vaughn, I 
VAUGHN: Thank you, Packer. Thank you. 
PACKER: Yes sir. 
(Packer leaves.) 
VAUGHN: I must apologise for Packer's crude devotion to duty. But your method of entry into my building was rather unconventional, wasn't it? 
JAMIE: Aye, well, there was no need for all that gas and stuff. 
DOCTOR: Jamie. I think perhaps it is we who should be apologising to you, Mister 
VAUGHN: Vaughn. Tobias Vaughn. I'm the managing director of International Electromatics. Your business must be very pressing to force you to such extremes. 
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. 
VAUGHN: Concerning Professor Watkins? 
JAMIE: How did you know? 
VAUGHN: My computer. It reported directly to me. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. 
VAUGHN: You've gone to a lot of trouble for nothing, you know. The Professor's working on an experiment and refuses to see anyone. 
JAMIE: Ah, well, we only want to talk to him, you see. 
VAUGHN: Perhaps I can help. 
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so, thank you very much. 
JAMIE: Oh, come on Doctor. It's only a couple of electronic circuits. 
(The Doctor kicks Jamie on the ankle.) 
VAUGHN: Circuits? Electronic circuits? My technicians are the best in the world. I'm sure they'd be able to assist you. Show me the circuits. 
DOCTOR: Well, I 
VAUGHN: Please, I'd like to help. 
(The Doctor hands Vaughn the Tardis circuits.) 
VAUGHN: As you say, rather complex. However, I'm sure we'll be able to help you. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I. 
VAUGHN: I'll have them sent to my workshops immediately. 
DOCTOR: Oh, how very kind. 
VAUGHN: Not at all. Professor Watkins is a valued colleague. Any friend of his is. 
(Vaughn puts the circuits in a drawer, next to a pistol.) 
VAUGHN: Oh, have you got one of these, young man? 
JAMIE: No. What is it? 
VAUGHN: Surely you've seen them about. They're disposable transistor radios. One of our latest products. Most popular. We've sold ten million in this country alone. Here. Compensation for the treatment you received from the worthy Packer. 
JAMIE: Thank you. How does it work? 
(Jamie presses the only button and loud music plays. The Doctor switches it off again.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's how you turn it off, Jamie. 
VAUGHN: Now if you'll excuse me, I'm afraid I have an urgent appointment. 
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Come along, Jamie. 
VAUGHN: Packer will meet you and show you the way out, Mister? 
DOCTOR: Doctor. Goodbye. 
VAUGHN: Goodbye, Doctor. 
JAMIE: Goodbye, Mister Vaughn. Thank you for the radio. 
VAUGHN: Not at all.
(The Doctor and Jamie leave. Vaughn looks closely at one of the circuits then activates his intercom.) 
VAUGHN: Packer? 
PACKER [on monitor]: Yes, Mister Vaughn? 
VAUGHN: Show our visitors off the premises, will you? 
PACKER [on monitor]: Very good, sir.

[Outside IE]

PACKER: The next time, read the notice on the door. 
JAMIE: Oh, don't tell me you can read as well. What else do you do!? 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
(Packer goes back inside.) 
JAMIE: Friendly sort of chap. 
DOCTOR: Hmm? 
JAMIE: Is something wrong? 
DOCTOR: Yes. That fellow's not what he seems. 
JAMIE: That big idiot? Oh don't worry. I'll soon sort 
DOCTOR: No, no, no. I mean Vaughn. The normal range of human blinking is about once every ten or fifteen seconds. Vaughn was blinking far less frequently than that. 
JAMIE: Oh, and he's got a forked tail and wee horns. 
DOCTOR: Oh I'm not joking, Jamie. Underneath all that charm there was something odd. Sinister. Almost inhuman.

[Vaughn's office]

(Vaughn puts the circuit back in the drawer and flicks a switch. Part of the back wall off the office opens to reveal a very alien computer, at the centre of which is an oval cybernetic head.)

Episode Two

[Street]

(Jamie and the Doctor are walking down Walmer Road when the Doctor notices a Jaguar following them. (460WPE) It is Benton and Tracy. They start to run.)

[Lounge]

(Zoe is still wearing the boa and holding a pose as Isobel takes an upward photograph.) 
ISOBEL: Hold it now. Last one. Okay, you can relax. 
ZOE: Oh good. I didn't know standing still could be so exhausting. 
ISOBEL: Would you like some coffee? 
ZOE: Mmm, please. How long have they been gone? 
ISOBEL: Oh, I don't know. About a couple of hours, I suppose. 
ZOE: I hope they're all right. 
ISOBEL: Oh, of course they are. Probably got themselves lost or something. What's so important about these, er, circuit things you were telling me about, anyway? 
ZOE: Well, they were part of the. Well, it's a sort of machine we travel in. 
ISOBEL: Oh. You mean a sort of electric car? 
ZOE: Well, it's a bit more sophisticated than that. 
ISOBEL: Oh, well anyway, I'm hope that you're going to stick around for a bit. I get sick of photographing myself. 
ZOE: Oh, why don't you always use a model? 
ISOBEL: Can't afford it. I've only just got about enough cash to buy all the junk I need for the camera. It's an expensive business and, well, I'm not good enough to be a professional yet. 
ZOE: Well, I think you're very good. These photographs of you are splendid. 
ISOBEL: Yeah. Yeah, they're great but I didn't take them. I was just the model. That's how I earned the loot to pay for all this. 
ZOE: Oh, I see. 
ISOBEL: You're still worried about your two friends, aren't you? 
ZOE: Yes, a bit. 
ISOBEL: They can't have got themselves into any sort of trouble, can they? 
ZOE: Oh, you wouldn't say that if you knew them. If there's trouble to be found, the Doctor and Jamie can't miss it.

[Street]

(The Doctor and Jamie run down another street to find another Jaguar stopped in front of them. The men get out as the first car comes round the corner behind them and Benton and Tracy get out.) 
JAMIE: Well, what do we do now, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Accept the situation, Jamie. There's nothing else we can do. 
(The Doctor sits on the curb and starts dealing out playing cards. The four men walk up.)

[Vaughn's office]

(A boffin is looking at the circuit board.) 
VAUGHN: Well? For a Head Research Assistant, Gregory, I expect a little more coherent a reply than an enigmatic shake of the head. 
GREGORY: I'm sorry, Mister Vaughn. I've never seen anything like these before. Given time I might be able 
VAUGHN: Then take time, my dear fellow. 
GREGORY: Right, Mister Vaughn. 
VAUGHN: Take one hour. 
(Gregory leaves. Vaughn uses the intercom.) 
VAUGHN: Packer. 
PACKER [on monitor]: Yes, Mister Vaughn? 
VAUGHN: Packer, those two uninvited guests we had this morning. I assume they were photographed? 
PACKER [on monitor]: Yes, sir. Security cameras will have taken visual recordings, sir. 
VAUGHN: Have some prints taken and sent up to me.

[Lounge]

(Isobel is playing a 78 record of 'The Teddy Bear's Picnic' on a phonograph.) 
ISOBEL: Great, isn't it? I got it off a barrow in the Portobello Road. 
ZOE: Oh, yes. 
ISOBEL: What's the matter? Don't you like it? 
ZOE: Oh, yes, it's fine. 
ISOBEL: You're still worried about your two friends, aren't you? Why? 
ZOE: Oh, I don't know. I've just got this feeling that something's happened to them. 
ISOBEL: Why on earth should it have? 
ZOE: No reason at all, really. It's not a logical conclusion, just intuition. 
ISOBEL: Well, I'll tell you what we'll do then. We'll go right out after them, okay? 
ZOE: Oh yes, please. 
ISOBEL: We'd better leave a note for them just in case they come back when we're not here. 
ZOE: Okay. 
ISOBEL: I'll go and get my coat first.

[Aeroplane]

(Jaguar drives across RAF Fairford to where a Hercules transport plane is lowering its access ramp. Military personnel put out a pair of smaller ramps and it drives straight up and onboard. Jamie and the Doctor walk through a door in a glass map of the northern hemisphere centred on the North Pole into an area where military personnel in grey uniforms with UNIT shoulder flashes are working. Benton and Tracy follow.) 
JAMIE: Would you mind telling us what all this is about? 
BENTON: You'll find out, sir. 
JAMIE: Sir? 
(An officer comes out of a forward compartment.) 
BRIGADIER: All right, Benton, thank you. 
BENTON: Sir. 
TRACY: NAAFI break, sir? 
BRIGADIER: Very well. 
(Benton and Tracy leave.) 
BRIGADIER: How nice to see you again, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: It's Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart! 
BRIGADIER: Ah, Brigadier now. I've gone on up in the world. 
JAMIE: Oh course, the Yetis. We met you in the 
BRIGADIER: That's right, McCrimmon, in the underground. Must be four years ago now. 
JAMIE: That long. It only seems about a couple of weeks ago, doesn't it. 
DOCTOR: I've told you over and over again, Jamie. Time is relative. 
BRIGADIER: Are you still making a nonsense of it. Doctor, in your, what was it called? Tardis? 
DOCTOR: Yes, we're still travelling. Yes. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, Mister Travers told me all about it. It's er, well it's, to say the least, an unbelievable machine. 
DOCTOR: Any more unbelievable than the Yetis? 
BRIGADIER: No, true. I'm not quite so much of a sceptic as I was since that little escapade. 
DOCTOR: But what's all this, and why all the cloak and dagger stuff to bring us here? 
BRIGADIER: Yes, I'm sorry about that but my chaps have to be a bit melodramatic in their methods. But I'll explain. Look, do sit down. 
JAMIE: Thank you. 
DOCTOR: How nice. 
BRIGADIER: Oh, Sergeant Walters! 
WALTERS: Yes sir? 
BRIGADIER: Lay on some tea, will you? You'd like some tea, wouldn't you, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Oh thank you, and a patty cake biscuit. Thank you. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, since the Yeti do, I've been in charge of an independent intelligence group that we call UNIT. That's United Nations Intelligence Taskforce. 
JAMIE: You mean you're like a world secret police. 
BRIGADIER: Not quite. We don't actually arrest people, just investigate them. 
JAMIE: But what about us? I mean, you arrested us. 
BRIGADIER: Not really. You see, my men were keeping a watch on the International Electromatic Headquarters when you two showed up. I've been keeping a check on everyone going in that building. Your photographs were transmitted to this Headquarters and I recognised you. 
DOCTOR: But what's so odd about people going into the building? 
BRIGADIER: Oh, nothing odd about them going in. The trouble is, some of them haven't come out.

[IE Reception]

ZOE: Looks like a robot reception. 
ISOBEL: Yeah. Yes, This probably the same idiot machine that answers the telephone when you ring up. 
(Zoe switches it on.) 
WOMAN: International Electromatic Company. State your business. 
ZOE: Enquiry. Reference two persons seeking information concerning the whereabouts of Professor Watkins. 
WOMAN: Wait please.

[Vaughn's office]

(Vaughn looks at photograph E091/5D/78 of the Doctor and Jamie looking up at the skyscraper, then opens the secret panel.) 
VAUGHN: Has the information been considered? 
PLANNER: The images of the two humans have been analysed and registered. They are known and are hostile. 
VAUGHN: Hostile? How can that be? Have you been on Earth before? 
PLANNER: No, they have been recognised on Planet Fourteen. They are dangerous and must be destroyed. 
VAUGHN: Planet Fourteen? But how? 
PLANNER: They must be destroyed. 
VAUGHN: Yes, I'll deal with them. 
PLANNER: Plans for invasion are nearing completion. Nothing must be allowed to interrupt them. 
VAUGHN: Don't worry. Nothing will. 
PLANNER: Nothing must be allowed to interrupt them. 
(Vaughn closes the secret panel. His intercom beeps and the monitor shows Zoe with his automated receptionist.)

[IE Reception]

ZOE: Now listen to me, you stupid, primitive machine, I asked a perfectly simple question, and I expect an answer. 
WOMAN: No information available. 
ISOBEL: It's no good Zoe. 
ZOE: I will not be beaten by this brainless tin box. 
ISOBEL: But you can't do anything about it. 
ZOE: Can't I? A little problem in ALGOL, I think. 
ISOBEL: In what? 
ZOE: ALGOL. It's a sort of language you talk to computers in. Now watch. 
(Zoe switches on the machine again.) 
WOMAN: International Electromatic Company. State your business. 
ZOE: Begin. Real X sum positive. Delete square. Begin sum two, subscript J. 
ISOBEL: That's ALGOL? 
ZOE: Integer compute. Printout Y to the minus X variable one. I'm enjoying this. 
WOMAN: International Electro 
ZOE: Go to finish. Continue. Integrate on iversine. 
(Smoke comes from the magnetic tapes.) 
ISOBEL: It seems to be getting a little bit heated. 
ZOE: You bet. This equation is insoluble. 
ISOBEL: Zoe, I think you ought to stand back. 
(ZOE stands back with ISOBEL and tells the computer.) 
ZOE: Now, continue printout continuous integration. 
(The computer goes Bang. Zoe and Isobel laugh.)

[Vaughn's office]

(Vaughn is smiling too.) 
VAUGHN: Packer! 
(PACKER appears on the intercom.) 
PACKER [on monitor]: Yes, sir? 
VAUGHN: Reception. Two young girls. Bring them to me. 
PACKER [on monitor]: Right, Mister Vaughn.

[IE Reception]

ZOE: It'll take more than a soldering iron to put that right. 
ISOBEL: Hey, don't you think we better get out of here before somebody gets annoyed? 
ZOE: Oh yes. I think perhaps you're right. 
(Zoe and Isobel are grabbed by black uniformed men at the door.)

[Aeroplane]

(There are a series of overhead photographs on the map table.) 
BRIGADIER: This is Gordon Jones, lecturer in physics, Churchill College, Cambridge. Next one's a chap I knew at Sandhurst, old Billy Rutlidge. He's got himself a very cushy number at the Ministry of Defence. 
DOCTOR: And all these people went into the building, the IE building, and didn't come out. 
BRIGADIER: No, no, most of them came out again, but there was something definitely odd about them when they did. 
DOCTOR: Odd? 
BRIGADIER: Yes, old Billy Rutlidge, for instance. He was quite cooperative about my investigation into Vaughn initially but after he'd been to the IE Building he started getting a bit sticky about it. 
JAMIE: Doctor, would you look at that one! 
BRIGADIER: Do you know this man? 
DOCTOR: Jamie, yes. 
JAMIE: Aye, he gave us a lift in his lorry. 
BRIGADIER: When did you last see him? 
JAMIE: This morning. 
BRIGADIER: This man's an agent of ours. His report is almost twelve hours overdue. 
JAMIE: Ah, well he did say something about some security guards on his tail. 
DOCTOR: I expect that he's all right. He was all right this morning when we left him. Brigadier, tell me more about this International Electromatics set-up. 
BRIGADIER: Oh, there isn't much to tell. The head of the group is a man named Tobias Vaughn. 
JAMIE: Oh yes, we've met him. A nice man. He gave me this. 
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie, don't 
BRIGADIER: Oh yes, that's just the small stuff. They control practically all of the major computer lines. 
DOCTOR: Put it away. 
BRIGADIER: They made their real breakthrough in micro-monolithic circuit designs, undercutting practically everyone else in the market. 
DOCTOR: But what's your interest in this? 
BRIGADIER: Well, I knew a little about Vaughn before his sudden success. I put out a routine check on him and we came up with one or two things of interest. 
JAMIE: Like the disappearance of Professor Watkins. 
BRIGADIER: Yes. 
JAMIE: Ah. See? 
DOCTOR: I see. I don't suppose you have any authority to search the building, have you? 
BRIGADIER: No. Vaughn's too powerful. He's got too many top people on his side. You see, Doctor, I daren't make a move against him unless I have good reason to do so. 
DOCTOR: Well, it looks to me if Jamie and I want to find the Professor, we'll have to find him in our own way. 
BRIGADIER: That's about the sum of it. However, should you find yourself in any difficulty. Sergeant Walters! 
WALTERS: Yes, sir? BRIGADIER: Got a TM-45 handy? 
WALTERS: Yes, sir. Right here. 
DOCTOR: Is that a tank? 
BRIGADIER: Oh no, no. My units are on constant alert, so should you find yourselves in any real trouble, you can just give us a call. 
DOCTOR: Jolly good. 
WALTERS: Here you are, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Thank you, Sergeant. 
BRIGADIER: Now, this is a small transceiver, range of about fifty miles on a set frequency. Just press this button and ask for me. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, that's splendid. Yes, this should come in very handy. 
BRIGADIER: Call me any time. I'm usually available. Now, I'd better lay on transport to get you two back to London. [Outside Travers' house]

(No answer to the doorbell.) 
JAMIE: No. They must have gone out. 
(But the front door opens as Jamie leans on it.) 
DOCTOR: Zoe? Isobel?

[Lounge]

JAMIE: Probably gone for a walk. 
DOCTOR: Look, Jamie, sandwiches. I'm hungry. Want one? 
JAMIE: Thank you. You know, Doctor. That chap, Mister Vaughn, doesn't seem such a bad man. 
(Jamie turns his radio on.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie. How can I think when you've got that thing on? 
JAMIE: Hey! 
(The Doctor examines the little trannie.) DOCTOR: All right, all right. 
JAMIE: Don't break it. 
DOCTOR: All right! I just want to take a look at it, that's all. Oh, yes. It's an interesting little piece of 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: Well, well, well. What have we here? 
JAMIE: What do you mean, what have we here? 
DOCTOR: There's a micro-monolithic circuit in the back plate of this radio. 
JAMIE: Well, what's that? 
DOCTOR: It's a very complex circuit in miniature. 
JAMIE: What's so odd about that? 
DOCTOR: It has nothing to do with the radio, as far as I can see. 
JAMIE: Oh Doctor, just put it back together again. 
DOCTOR: All right! 
JAMIE: I don't suppose Zoe would have left a note, do you? No, I can't see anything. Well you might at least help me look for it. 
DOCTOR: I suggest that we try the wall. 
JAMIE: Eh?

[Hallway]

DOCTOR: Isobel never writes anything on paper. You can't lose a wall, remember. JAMIE: Oh. Ah! Tired of waiting. Gone to IE offices to look for you. Zoe and Isobel. DOCTOR: Jamie! We'd better go after them.

[Vaughn's office]

VAUGHN: You and your friend the Doctor, have caused some considerable trouble today. First he breaks into this building and then you ruin a very expensive device. 
ISOBEL: Only because the stupid thing wouldn't tell us what we wanted to know. 
VAUGHN: Ah, yes, Miss Watkins. You're concerned about your uncle, aren't you? 
ISOBEL: I'd like to know where he is, yes. 
VAUGHN: He's perfectly well, I assure you, although a little, er, uncooperative at the moment. Your visit here is most opportune. I think that you can be very useful to me. 
ISOBEL: Me? But how? 
VAUGHN: Your uncle needs to be persuaded to continue his work for me. 
ISOBEL: But I can't do anything about that. 
VAUGHN: No, But I can now. Packer, I'd like you to take care of these two young ladies please. 
PACKER: Take them! 
(Burly guards take Zoe and Isobel out.)

[Outside the IE building]

(Jamie starts up the entrance steps but the Doctor beckons him on down the side of the building.) 
JAMIE: I thought that we were going in there to look for Zoe and Isobel? 
DOCTOR: There's no one in there except that stupid computer, and that's won't tell us anything. 
JAMIE: But how are we going to find out that they are in there? 
DOCTOR: Well, if the Brigadier's men are still around, they should have seen them go in. Hello? 
MAN [OC]: UNIT to operations, over. 
DOCTOR: Hello, could I speak to the Brigadier? 
MAN [OC]: Stand by. Out. 
DOCTOR: What a splendid little toy this is, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Aye, but doesn't play tunes like mine.

[Aeroplane]

BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor. I've got a report here on two girls. About nineteen or so. One of them dark, one of them fair. One of them was wearing very distinct clothes. 
JAMIE [OC]: Zoe! Doctor, that could have been Zoe. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Jamie, just a minute please. Brigadier. 
BRIGADIER: Yes? 
DOCTOR [OC]: These clothes. Did they include a rather brightly-coloured feather boa? 
BRIGADIER: Yes, the little dark one was wearing that. They friends of yours? 
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes, I'm afraid they are. 
JAMIE [OC]: Doctor, come on, let's get after them. 
DOCTOR [OC]: All right, all right, Jamie. Brigadier, we're going to try to get into the building and try to find them. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, be careful. You may not be so lucky this time. Call me if you get into trouble. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Thanks. 
BRIGADIER: Right, over and out. 
TURNER: Is it wise to let them go in alone, sir? I mean, they don't exactly sound like professionals to me. 
BRIGADIER: Don't underestimate them, Jimmy. They may look like amateurs, but that man has an incredible knack of being one jump ahead of everyone. If there is a safe way into that place, he'll be the one to find it.

[Railway sidings]

(The Doctor and Jamie follow a railway track in Park Royal - Guinness Brewery really - and look through the chainlink fence at black uniformed men and freight carriages.) 
JAMIE: You're right, you know. This does lead into the back of the place. 
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Jamie. Come on. 
(They go through the gate into the sidings proper.)

[Vaughn's office]

GREGORY: I'm sorry, sir, but these circuits don't make sense. The material isn't any known metal alloy. In fact, the structure's more that of a plastic. What's more, the connections seems to be to be completely illogical. 
VAUGHN: Hmm. How very interesting. This strange Doctor intrigues me more and more. 
GREGORY: I can do some more tests on the circuits if you like, sir, but 
VAUGHN: No, I think I know the answer, Gregory. You can go. 
GREGORY: Yes, sir. 
(Gregory leaves and Vaughn opens the secret panel.) 
VAUGHN: I need more data about this man that you say you recognise, this Doctor. 
PLANNER: It is enough that you know he is hostile. He must be destroyed. 
VAUGHN: You said you recognised him on Planet Fourteen. How is this possible? 
PLANNER: These questions are unnecessary. He must be destroyed. 
VAUGHN: That is for me to decide. 
PLANNER: You will obey. 
VAUGHN: You forget I control the operation from Earth! Unless that's clearly understood, our partnership will cease! Tell that to your leader. 
PLANNER: It has been agreed. 
VAUGHN: I felt sure you would be reasonable. Now, you say you recognised this Doctor on Planet Fourteen. How did he get there? 
PLANNER: He has a machine. 
VAUGHN: What sort of machine? 
PLANNER: We have no more information. But he must be destroyed. The invasion must succeed. 
VAUGHN: It will. The Doctor will be taken care of. I shall see to that personally.

[Warehouse]

(An eight foot metal container with what looks like a bottle cap on both ends is carried in and laid on the floor. There are lots more already stacked up. The Doctor and Jamie are watching from behind a wall.) 
DOCTOR: That's incredible! 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: The ease with which that man carried that crate. 
JAMIE: Probably empty. 
DOCTOR: Let's go and see. 
(But their combined efforts do not move it.) 
JAMIE: That man must be a superman. 
DOCTOR: It's odd, Jamie, it's distinctly odd. 
JAMIE: There's someone coming. 
(They run back behind the wall. The man carries in another container, puts it down and leaves.) 
JAMIE: It's amazing. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
JAMIE: Come on, let's find Zoe and Isobel and get out of here. These fellows are giving me the creeps. 
DOCTOR: Yes.

[Vaughn's office]

(The intercom is beeping.) 
VAUGHN: Yes? 
PACKER [on monitor: They're back again, Mister Vaughn. The Doctor and the boy. Security eye has picked them up in the warehouse. 
VAUGHN: That's rather unfortunate for them, isn't it, Packer? 
PACKER [on monitor]: Shall I put a full security alert on, sir? VAUGHN: No, Packer. We don't want to frighten them off, do we? Just close off the area and we'll flush them out. Have you dealt with the two young ladies yet? 
PACKER [on monitor]: No, sir. I was about to when this new alert happened. 
VAUGHN: How fortunate. We need a sprat to catch our mackerel. Take them down to the warehouse area.

[Warehouse]

JAMIE: This place is like a maze. Doctor, I think we're lost. 
DOCTOR: There must be a door to the main building somewhere. 
(Screams.) 
JAMIE: Zoe and Isobel! Come on. 
(Two warehousemen in overalls carry the unconscious Zoe and Isobel up to a container.) 
PACKER: Right. Put them inside. 
(The container lid is shut with a piece of feather boa sticking out.) 
PACKER: Load it onto the return van. 
JAMIE: Come on! 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie. Wait. 
(Jamie tackles Packer from behind.) 
PACKER: Guards! Guards! 
DOCTOR: The guards! Come on. 
(The Doctor and Jamie run round walls, but they are cornered by armed guards and brought back to Packer, who draws his pistol.) 
PACKER: Like rats in a trap.

Episode Three

[Warehouse]

PACKER: You really don't learn, do you? This is private property. A restricted area. 
JAMIE: Where's Zoe? Where have you taken her?! 
PACKER: Be quiet! 
JAMIE: Look, we heard them scream. If you've hurt her 
PACKER: I said be quiet! 
(Jamie lunges at Packer and gets thrown off into a wall.) 
VAUGHN: Packer! You really must try and control this violent streak in your nature, Packer. Although I must admit the situation is provoking. 
So here you are again. You really are beginning to try our patience, you know. 
JAMIE: And he's beginning to try mine. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, Jamie. We came here looking for two friends of ours. 
VAUGHN: Two young ladies? Yes. 
JAMIE: So he admits that they're here. 
VAUGHN: Correction. They were. It would seem that you've been chasing each other's tails. They came here looking for you. 
DOCTOR: Where are they now? 
VAUGHN: Why, they left, of course. 
JAMIE: Aye, carted off by two of your thugs in a box. 
VAUGHN: Oh really. 
JAMIE: Look, it's true. We heard them scream and I saw some of Zoe's clothes trapped in the lid. 
VAUGHN: You really do have a very fertile imagination, young man. 
JAMIE: Now listen you, I'm telling I definitely saw those 
DOCTOR: Jamie, Jamie. It would set our minds at rest if we could take a look inside those boxes. 
VAUGHN: Then you shall. Packer, I presume the only crates going out of here are the empty ones being returned to the factory? 
PACKER: Yes, sir. They're loading now, sir. 
VAUGHN: Then you shall inspect them at your leisure. After you. 
DOCTOR: How kind. 
(The Doctor, Jamie and the guards leave. Vaughn gestures to Packer and leaves. Packer speaks into his wrist communicator.) 
PACKER: This is Packer. Get the return van moving immediately. Do you understand? I said immediately!

[Outside the warehouse]

(The freight train rattles off down the line.) 
VAUGHN: Ah, just too late, I'm afraid. Such a pity. Still, all is not lost. I am myself going down to the factory today. Would you care to join me? We can meet the train on its arrival. 
DOCTOR: Well, that's very civil of you. 
VAUGHN: My pleasure.

[Aeroplane]

BRIGADIER: How long ago did they go in? 
BENTON [OC]: Some time ago, sir. Tracy followed them as far as the official boundaries of the railway sidings. They went in about an hour ago. 
BRIGADIER: Is Tracy still round there? 
BENTON [OC]: Yes sir. 
BRIGADIER: Right, stick around for a while. 
BENTON [OC]: Just a minute, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, what is it, Benton? 
BENTON [OC]: The Doctor and the boy. They're coming out, sir, with Vaughn. 
(Jamie gets into the Rolls through the door held open by the chauffeur, then out the other side and into the passenger seat just before Packer got to it.) 
BRIGADIER: Benton, what's happening? What's happening? 
BENTON [OC]: Oh, sorry, sir. Nothing really, they've all got into Vaughn's private car. Oh, they're driving off, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Is any force being used? 
BENTON [OC]: No, not that I can see. Packer was there but it looked very friendly to me. Shall we follow? 
BRIGADIER: No, I'll have them tracked more discretely. Over and out. Sergeant Walters. 
WALTERS: Yes sir? 
BRIGADIER: Alert all area patrols in section three. 
WALTERS: Yes, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Did you hear all that, Jimmy? 
WALTERS: I did, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Look, we'll get you aboard a chopper and you can rendezvous with the tracking agent. 
WALTERS: All right, sir. Are they any specific instructions? 
BRIGADIER: No, we're playing a bit by ear for the moment, so try and keep out of trouble. Should the Doctor contract us for help, I'll have his signal relayed straight to you. 
WALTERS: Right, sir. 
(The Rolls is admitted into the IE compound. The guards look up at the sound of rotors overhead.)

[Helicopter]

TURNER: They've just gone into the IE area, sir. Shall I follow?

[Aeroplane]

BRIGADIER: No, circle the area. We can't really do anything until we get a request from the Doctor. 
TURNER [OC]: Standing by, sir. 
BRIGADIER: And Jimmy? Keep out of sight. If Vaughn's private army see you they might well get the wind up and that might make things rather unhealthy for the Doctor and the boy. Over and out.

[Lift]

(The guards present arms to Vaughn when they arrive at the building and go in. They walk along a narrow corridor and into a lift.) 
JAMIE: Hey, what's happening? I thought we were looking for Zoe and Isobel. 
VAUGHN: All in good time, young man. The train and the empty crate car will take some time to get here. In the meantime I'd rather like to talk to you. 
DOCTOR: Oh. really? 
VAUGHN: Yes. Those circuits you gave me, they're rather fascinating. I like to know more about them. 
(The lift arrives at its destination.)

[Corridor]

VAUGHN: This way gentleman. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
(The Doctor and Jamie walk ahead.) 
VAUGHN: Packer. Be a good fellow and see if Professor Watkins is finished, will you? 
PACKER: Very good, Mister Vaughn. 
VAUGHN: You might offer him a little encouragement. Coming, gentlemen. 
(Packer heads down to floor three with a big grin on his face.)

[Vaughn's office]

JAMIE: Hey! Doctor, it's 
VAUGHN: Confusing, isn't it? 
JAMIE: It's exactly the same as your office in London. 
VAUGHN: In all basic essentials, yes, it is. That's the secret of my success, you see. Uniformity, duplication. My whole empire is based on that principle. The very essence of business efficiency. Do sit down. 
DOCTOR: Oh, how kind. 
VAUGHN: I must say I'm rather glad we have this opportunity to talk. 
DOCTOR: Really? 
VAUGHN: I should, of course, be angry with you. You've thwarted my elaborate security precautions twice. I'd like to know why. 
DOCTOR: Oh, that's quite simple. I hate computers and refuse to be bullied by them. 
VAUGHN: Your young friend Zoe. 
JAMIE: Well, what about her? 
VAUGHN: She appears to have the same instincts. She so confused one of my computers she ruined its memory store. 
JAMIE: So that's why your thugs dragged her and Isobel away. 
VAUGHN: My dear young man, I wasn't angry with her. On the contrary I found the incident quite amusing. She's a remarkable girl. And you, Doctor, are obviously a man of no mean scientific ability. 
DOCTOR: Why do you say that? 
VAUGHN: Oh, my research department found these quite fascinating. There's a totally illogical factor in their construction. Are they of your own invention? 
Ah, you're determined to guard your secret, I see. I don't blame you, and I promise not to pry any more. In fact, I'll do all I can to help you. 
DOCTOR: Oh, how kind. 
VAUGHN: Now you say you came here looking for Professor Watkins because you thought he might be able to help you. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
VAUGHN: Then I'll try to persuade him to put aside his work and er, concentrate his efforts on your behalf. Make yourself at home. 
(Vaughn leaves.) 
JAMIE: Hey, look, you're not going to trust him, are you? I mean, what about Zoe and Isobel? 
DOCTOR: I haven't forgotten them, Jamie. 
JAMIE: They're in that box, I'm sure of it. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, we're not going to help Zoe by annoying Mister Vaughn, are we? 
JAMIE: I don't think you could annoy that man even if you want to. He's being as nice as pie. 
DOCTOR: He's too nice. 
JAMIE: Aye, but why should he be? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. He was a little bit too interested in these circuits for my liking. 
JAMIE: Hey, do you think he knows about the Tardis then? 
DOCTOR: Well, I don't see how he could do. 
JAMIE: No, well, perhaps this Professor Watkins will be able to tell us what's going on around here. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but that's what worrying me. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: Well, if Vaughn has anything to hide, why is he letting us talk to Watkins?

[Laboratory]

PACKER: I'd think about it if I was you, Professor. After all, she's a pretty girl. It'll be a shame to spoil all that. 
WATKINS: What a vicious sadist, you are, Packer. I don't believe you anyway. 
PACKER: I don't make idle threats, Professor, as you well know. If you want to see that girl again in one piece I suggest you do as Mister Vaughn asks. 
WATKINS: How do I know that you already haven't harmed her. If you have got her 
VAUGHN: You can take my word for that, Professor. 
WATKINS: Your word. I know how much I can value I can place on that. 
VAUGHN: Harsh words, Professor, harsh words. Any progress? So, you haven't yet completed the machine? 
WATKINS: No, and I don't intend to. 
VAUGHN: Oh I think you will, Professor. Much as I detest violence, I find it difficult to restrain Packer's er, indisputable talent for persuasion. Your niece is in our custody, and unless you do as I ask, I shall hand her over to Packer. The choice is yours. 
WATKINS: If I do cooperate, will you let her go? 
VAUGHN: Oh no, she's our guarantee. But she'll come to no harm. 
WATKINS: All right. But I must see Isobel first. 
VAUGHN: Of course. Oh, there is just one other thing. Don't look at me so suspiciously, my dear Professor. It's merely that there are some friends of yours here that wish to see you. 
WATKINS: Friends? 
VAUGHN: Yes, they're going to great pains to seek you out. 
WATKINS: But I haven't been allowed visitors since I came here. Why are you suddenly considerate? I might tell them everything. 
VAUGHN: Everything? My dear Professor, you know nothing that can harm me. Besides, there's always Isobel to consider, isn't there? 
PACKER: Or would you rather leave her to me? 
VAUGHN: Now, now, Packer. The Professor's going to do exactly as we ask, aren't you?

[Vaughn's office]

(The Doctor and Jamie are looking out of the picture window.) 
JAMIE: There, you see? 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, I can see. Let's have a closer look at that, shall we? 
(The Doctor uses Jamie as a support for his telescope.) 
DOCTOR: Now just hold still a minute. Keep your shoulder still. That's odd. That's very odd. 
JAMIE: What is it? 
(It looks like Fylingdale, which is a neat trick from near London. Sadly those golf balls no longer exist.) 
DOCTOR: Well, it looks like a deep space radio communication system. What's it's doing here? 
JAMIE: Don't ask me, you're the brains. Hey look, a helicopter. Could it be the Brigadier's lot. 
DOCTOR: Yes, it could be. 
JAMIE: Shush. There's someone coming. 
(Packer enters.) 
PACKER: Come along.

[Aeroplane]

WALTERS: Hold on, sir, he's just here. Sir, it's Captain Turner. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, Jimmy, any news? 
TURNER [OC]: No, sir. Not a sign of them. 
BRIGADIER: Right, stay in the area. We daren't make a move until we hear from the Doctor. Over and out.

[Laboratory]

WATKINS: Yes, of course, I remember Anne Travers telling me about you. She was a student of mine, you know, some years ago. Brilliant girl, brilliant. 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, they went to America, didn't they? 
WATKINS: Oh, Travers was getting past it a bit, you know, and Anne persuaded him to go to America with her. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes. 
WATKINS: What are you doing here? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's a long story.

[Vaughn's office]

VAUGHN: This strange Doctor's been on another planet, Packer. 
PACKER: That's not possible. 
VAUGHN: It is a fact, Packer. He has some sort of machine. Now let's see if we can learn more about it, shall we? Switch on, Packer. With sound. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: So we went to see Mister Vaughn. He said that you were working on something important. 
PACKER: I see. That's why you want to leave them alone together. 
VAUGHN: Exactly, Packer.

[Laboratory]

JAMIE: But the Doctor needed some help on some electronic circuits that the Tardis needed. 
WATKINS: Really? 
JAMIE: Aye, aye. 
(An eye device in a wall moves.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, Jamie, I don't think the Professor wants to hear about that. 
WATKINS: On the contrary, what Anne told me about the Tardis was most intriguing. I'd like to hear a lot more about it. 
DOCTOR: Professor, I think that I should warn you that Anne Travers allowed her imagination to run a little wild. 
WATKINS: You mean to say there is no such machine? 
JAMIE: Of course there is. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, I think that there are other more important things to talk about at the moment. 
(The Doctor has gone to one side of the equipment rack and is pointing at the not very hidden camera.) 
JAMIE: Oh, I see, yes. 
DOCTOR: Professor, tell us about what you're doing here. 
WATKINS: Oh, it's very simple, really. I've been developing a new kind of teaching machine. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes? A teaching machine? 
JAMIE: What's it called? 
WATKINS: I call it the Cerebraton Mentor. 
JAMIE: Oh, aye? 
WATKINS: The main difference from the other teaching machines is that it is able to induce emotional changes in the subject. 
JAMIE: Oh. 
(The Doctor puts a small magnet on the camera.)

[Vaughn's office]

(The picture is replaced by static.) 
PACKER: Has it broken down? 
VAUGHN: Let's check. 
(Vaughn switches to other cameras around the compound.) 
VAUGHN: All the other monitors are functioning. 
PACKER: Yeah? 
VAUGHN: Our friend the Doctor's a resourceful man. No wonder our allies fear him. 
PACKER: Our allies know him? 
VAUGHN: Oh, yes. I was ordered to destroy him. But first I must learn the secrets of this extraordinary machine of his. 
PACKER: If you're been ordered to destroy him 
VAUGHN: I don't take orders, Packer, I give them! Now, I think the time has come to stop playing games with this Doctor!

[Laboratory]

WATKINS: But what can we do? If, as you say, they have Isobel and your young friend then we're entirely at their mercy. 
DOCTOR: No, no, not entirely. There's my friend the Brigadier, remember. 
WATKINS: Do you think he can help us? 
DOCTOR: Possibly. But quickly, tell me, what is Vaughn up to? What's he doing here? 
WATKINS: I know no more than you do. He's a ruthless man, without morals or principles. His object, I'm sure, is to get complete control of the electronics industry of the world! 
DOCTOR: I wonder. I've a nasty feeling he's aiming somewhat higher than that. 
(Jamie is listening at the door.) 
JAMIE: Doctor, quick, somebody's coming. 
(Vaughn enters.) 
VAUGHN: Don't bother, Doctor. Allow me. Very ingenious. A simple magnet. I congratulate you. 
DOCTOR: Oh, how kind. 
VAUGHN: However you must surely realise that it's forced me to consider other methods to make you talk. 
JAMIE: What are you going to do? 
VAUGHN: Your friend Zoe is due to arrive here shortly. 
JAMIE: So you have got her! Listen, if you've harmed her in any way 
VAUGHN: You may still be adolescent enough to make idle threats, young man, but I can assure you, I am not. I want your travel machine, Doctor. Otherwise I shall hand your friend Zoe over to Packer. It's a simple choice and shouldn't take you longer than an hour to consider. Take them away, Packer. 
(The guards manhandle the Doctor and Jamie out of the room.)
DOCTOR: All right. 
JAMIE: All right. 
PACKER: Leave them to me. I'll take them. 
(Packer leaves.) 
VAUGHN: Now, Professor, I suggest you continue with your work.

[Corridor]

DOCTOR: Oh dear. You know, Jamie, I've always been rather scared of lifts. 
JAMIE: Why? 
DOCTOR: I never even like to start them. You'll have to push the button. 
JAMIE: Me? 
PACKER: Keep your mouth shut and do as you're told. 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. Do as you're told. 
JAMIE: Oh yes, I see 
PACKER: Be quiet! 
(Jamie steps into the lift.) 
DOCTOR: Packer! Mister Packer, I obviously can't let you hurt Zoe, and so I'll have to tell you all want to know, now. 
PACKER: You mean, you're willing to talk? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure that Mister Vaughn will. Oh, there he is now. 
(Packer turns, the Doctor pushes him away.) 
JAMIE: Quick, Doctor! 
(The Doctor gets into the lift with Jamie and the doors close.)

[Lift]

DOCTOR: Your knife. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
DOCTOR: Your knife. Give me your knife. 
JAMIE: What are you going to do? 
DOCTOR: I'm going to try and break the circuit. 
JAMIE: What will that do? 
DOCTOR: It will either stop the lift, or send us out of control. 
JAMIE: But we're six floors up. 
DOCTOR: We'll have to take that risk. Hold tight, here we go. 
(The Doctor pulls the wires in the panel and there's a bang.)

[Vaughn's office]

VAUGHN: Why are you so gullible, Packer? 
PACKER: Just wait till I get hold of them. I'll 
VAUGHN: You'll do nothing! I want them in one piece. 
(Packer's wrist communicator buzzes.) 
PACKER: Packer here. Have you got them? Well, what happened? Stuck? How? Well, get on with it, man! The lift is struck between the fourth and fifth floors. 
VAUGHN: So I gathered, Packer. 
PACKER: Well, it's obviously a mechanical fault. Wait a minute. He did it! 
VAUGHN: Yes, Packer. Our clever Doctor has outwitted you. Oh, then that wouldn't be too difficult, would it? 
PACKER: Well, it won't do him much good, will it? After all, he can't get anywhere, can he? 
VAUGHN: No, but then why do it? He might be playing for time, but I doubt it.

[Lift]

DOCTOR: There was a fifty-fifty chance, you know, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Yes, but what good has it done us. I mean, we're stuck here in this lift now. 
DOCTOR: No, no, it's the lift that's stuck, not us. Look. 
(The Doctor points out the emergency exit in the roof.) 
JAMIE: Hey, where does that lead to? 
DOCTOR: Out into the lift shaft, I imagine. Quickly, on me back. 
JAMIE: You know something? You're a clever wee chappie. 
DOCTOR: Jamie.

[Corridor]

PACKER: (into comm.) Switch over to the emergency circuits. I want that lift operational in three minutes! (to guards) I want all lift exits covered. I want a man on each floor. Move! 
(The guards leave quickly.) 
VAUGHN: Don't panic, Packer. Our birds can't fly away.

[Lift shaft]

(Jamie and the Doctor climb onto the roof of the lift and look up the access ladder.) 
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jamie. Oh my word! Well, that's a long way up, isn't it? Oh well, we'd better get cracking before they realise what's happened. Perhaps I'd better shut this. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
(The Doctor closes the lift hatch.) 
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, I've just been thinking. What happens if they get the lift going before we get to the top? 
DOCTOR: Oh, that's simple. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: We get squashed. 
JAMIE: What! Well, come on!

[Corridor]

PACKER: Right. They've switched over the circuits. The lift's working. 
VAUGHN: How splendid. Bring it up here. 
PACKER: Bring it up to the sixth floor.

[Lift shaft]

JAMIE: Hey, that's not what I think it is, is it? 
DOCTOR: I'm very much afraid it is. Come on! 
JAMIE: We'll never make it! 
DOCTOR: Yes, we will! Come on! 
(The lift stops.) 
JAMIE: What's happened? 
DOCTOR: It's stopped. They must be checking. Come on, they may guess where we are and come after us.

[Corridor]

(Packer looks inside the lift.) 
PACKER: They've vanished! They just vanished! 
VAUGHN: Check the other floors! 
PACKER: This is Packer. Check all the lift exits and get me the engineer. Hello? Yes? Did the lift stop at any other floors on the way up? You're certain? Right, the engineer's certain. 
VAUGHN: The shaft terminates in the roof, doesn't it, Packer? 
PACKER: Yes, sir. 
VAUGHN: Why didn't you think of that? 
PACKER: I'll get them. 
VAUGHN: Call me when you do, Packer. I'll be in my office. And please don't fail this time, there's a good fellow. 
(Vaughn leaves.) 
PACKER: This is Packer. Get some men on the roof. They're still in the lift shaft. No! Don't take the lift. Those two might still be in. (pause) Hey, wait a minute. I'll take the lift. Tell the engineer to take it right to the top.

[Lift shaft]

(The Doctor and Jamie climb past a panel proclaiming Kilroy Was Here!.) 
JAMIE: Only another floor, Doctor. They've started it again! 
DOCTOR: Hurry, Jamie! Hurry!

[Rooftop]

(The Doctor and Jamie crawl exhausted out of the lift service door.) 
DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Wait a minute, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: No, come on. Let's see where we are. 
(The Doctor looks over the edge of the building.) 
JAMIE: Now where? 
DOCTOR: Down there. 
JAMIE: Oh no! 
DOCTOR: Well, we can't go down the lift again, can we? Hello. There's a fire escape. Come on.

[Vaughn's office]

VAUGHN: Oh, Packer, you do disappoint me. 
PACKER: They must have got down the fire escape, sir. 
VAUGHN: And, of course, you didn't think to have a guard on that! 
PACKER: Well, normally 
VAUGHN: You're a stupid incompetent! I want that Doctor! Put the whole compound on alert! Have every available guard on the job! Find him, Packer! Find him!

[Freight wagon]

(The Doctor and Jamie hide between two carriages as a guard passes by and an alarm sounds, then climb up into an IE marked freight wagon and close the door.) 
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor. Do you think that this is the train that Zoe and Isobel came on? 
DOCTOR: It could be. 
JAMIE: Vaughn said that one had empty crates on it, didn't he? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
JAMIE: Well, we'll soon see. Let's look inside. 
(They open a crate. It contains some muslin-like material.) 
JAMIE: Oh no, these are full. 
PACKER [OC]: I want all these trains searched from top to bottom! Move! 
DOCTOR: Jamie! Hide! Quickly, hide! 
(The Doctor goes out of sight and Jamie gets into the crate they just opened.)

[Crate]

PACKER [OC]: You two, search this one. 
(Jamie looks on in horror as the material next to him moves.)

Episode Four

[Freight wagon]

(Alarms blaring, Packer and his guards look into the wagon, then close the door and move on. The Doctor and Jamie come out of their hiding places.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie. Jamie! 
JAMIE: Doctor, I think 
DOCTOR: Shush. 
JAMIE: But Doctor 
DOCTOR: I think the guards are still out there. 
JAMIE: Doctor 
DOCTOR: Keep your voice down. 
JAMIE: That thing in there, it moved. In the crate, there's something alive in there. 
DOCTOR: Alive? Jamie, the darkness plays funny tricks with the imagination. 
JAMIE: Look, it moved, I tell you. 
DOCTOR: Are you sure? 
JAMIE: Positive. 
DOCTOR: All right, let's have a closer look. 
GUARD [OC]: You two! Over here! Get those two girls over the Main Administration Building! Move! 
JAMIE: Zoe and Isobel. 
DOCTOR: Wait. We'll follow in a few moments.

[Vaughn's office]

PACKER: The whole compound's under alert, Mister Vaughn. 
VAUGHN: And? 
PACKER: Well, er 
VAUGHN: You haven't yet found them. 
PACKER: Well it's only a matter of time. 
VAUGHN: Is it? I doubt it, Packer. This Doctor's far too clever a fish for you to net. 
PACKER: Well, if you'd let me take care of them properly in the first place and obeyed the orders of our allies, you might 
VAUGHN: Orders? Me, Packer? I told them and I'll tell you. I give orders, not take them. 
PACKER: You told them that? 
VAUGHN: The invasion's under my control, and when our purpose has been achieved I shall still be in control. 
PACKER: You can't fight them. 
VAUGHN: Packer. Why do you think I kept that old fool Watkins alive. 
PACKER: Well, to work on his machine of course. 
VAUGHN: And why did you think I wanted him to do that? 
PACKER: Well, you. I don't know. 
VAUGHN: Our allies appear to find the Professor's machine somewhat disturbing, so much so in fact that when they saw the prototype they ordered us to destroy it and all similar machines. 
PACKER: You mean they're frightened of it? 
VAUGHN: The teaching power of the machine didn't worry them, but when I generated some emotion pulses. I'm convinced, Packer, that emotion could be used to destroy them. 
PACKER: That's only a guess. 
VAUGHN: A gamble, Packer, a reasonable gamble, and after all we are playing this game for very high stakes, are we not? 
PACKER: Well, I think you're taking too big a chance. 
VAUGHN: Do you wish to be totally converted? Would you prefer to be one of them? Completely inhuman? 
PACKER: Oh, no! But 
VAUGHN: That's what'll happen if they take over. We will cease to be human. So, we must use their force and their might and then discard them. 
PACKER: And you're sure that this machine can do it? 
VAUGHN: Even if we fail, we could escape. The Doctor. We must secure this spacecraft of his. 
PACKER: Oh yeah, I see. Insurance. 
VAUGHN: Exactly, Packer. The two young ladies have arrived, I hope? 
PACKER: Yes, sir, they're under guard. 
VAUGHN: Good. 
PACKER: They're being taken over to the Main Administration Building now, sir. 
VAUGHN: When they're safely tucked away, we'll flush out our clever Doctor.

[Outside a building]

(The Doctor and Jamie watch two crates being taken into the building. One has a piece of feather boa sticking out.) 
PACKER: Take them inside. Central block, tenth floor. 
(The sound of a helicopter nearby.) 
JAMIE: Could be the Brigadier's lot. Call them up for help! 
DOCTOR: No, no, not yet. We've got to rescue the girls first. Tenth floor, central block. Come on.

[Helicopter]

TURNER: There's a lot of unusual activity, sir. Guards everywhere. It looks like some sort of emergency. 
BRIGADIER [OC]: Any sign of the Doctor and the boy? 
TURNER: No, sir. None at all. 
BRIGADIER: Right, Jimmy. Get out of the area and stand by. 
TURNER: Right, sir. Will do.

[Aeroplane]

BRIGADIER: All units, please, Sergeant. 
WALTERS: Yes, sir. Go ahead, sir. 
BRIGADIER: This is the Brigadier. All units stand by. Full penetration of Red sector imminent.

[Vaughn's office]

VAUGHN: A helicopter? 
PACKER: Yes, sir and two of the outer perimeter guard posts reported seeing strangers in the area outside, sir. 
VAUGHN: I see. 
PACKER: I think this Doctor's with the UNIT organisation. Well, what are we going to do? 
VAUGHN: Nothing. 
PACKER: Nothing? But they 
VAUGHN: They can't harm us, Packer. We're in control. Or at least I am. Leave this to me.

[Outside the Admin building]

(Jamie and the Doctor sneak around, avoiding guards, until they see a building with a big A on it.) 
JAMIE: What's that? 
DOCTOR: I should think that's the central block, wouldn't you, Jamie? 
JAMIE: How do we find out which room they're in? And when we have how do we get them out? 
DOCTOR: Stop looking for problems, Jamie. Let's get along up there, shall we? 
(An announcement comes over the compound tannoys.) 
VAUGHN [OC]: Doctor. If you can hear me, listen. You have ten minutes, Doctor. Ten minutes to relinquish your freedom. At the end of that time, your young friend Zoe will pay the consequences of your foolish and totally pointless opposition. Ten minutes, Doctor, ten minutes. 
JAMIE: There's not much time. 
DOCTOR: There's just about time enough to effect a simple rescue operation. Come along, Jamie.
JAMIE: Simple? 
DOCTOR: Yes, come along.

[Room]

(Isobel is hammering on the locked door.) 
ISOBEL: Oh, let us out of here, you stupid, idiotic. Oh, why have they brought us here? 
ZOE: I suppose because I ruined that stupid computer of theirs. Well, I'm sorry. 
ISOBEL: But why kidnap us? Why don't they just turn us over to the police or something? 
ZOE: I don't know. Anyway, we've got to get out of here. 
ISOBEL: We can't get out this way. Look, it's a sheer drop. Hey, Zoe! Zoe, look! 
ZOE: Doctor! Jamie!

[Fire escape]

ZOE [OC]: We're up here! 
JAMIE: Doctor, it's them, look! 
DOCTOR: Good. As long they don't give the game away too soon. 
(The Doctor gestures the girls to keep quiet and move back.)

[Room]

ISOBEL: It looked as if they were trying to tell us something. 
ZOE: The Doctor wants us to keep away from the window for some reason. 
ISOBEL: I wonder why? 
ZOE: Well, I'm not sure. 
(Zoe spots the surveillance camera.) 
ZOE: Just try and act as though nothing has happened. Don't look now, but we're being spied on.

[Aeroplane]

BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor, come in. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Brigadier, I think we shall require a little assistance in a few moments. 
BRIGADIER: Why? Are you in trouble? 
DOCTOR [OC]: No, but we shall need help. You have a helicopter in the area? 
BRIGADIER: Yes. 
DOCTOR [OC]: I wonder, have they a rope ladder on board. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, I pretty sure they have. Where are you? 
DOCTOR [OC]: We're just going up to the roof of the main building. That is the central block on the north side. That should give your helicopter cover should there be any ground fire. Have you got that? 
BRIGADIER: Yes, I've got that. Over and out.

[Vaughn's office]

PACKER: All right, keep looking. Find them! 
(Guards leave.) 
PACKER: I've got the whole place covered, Mister Vaughn. 
VAUGHN: Don't worry, Packer. They won't risk any harm coming to their little friends. Doctor, you have five minutes. Five minutes. 
PACKER: They won't give themselves up. They'd be mad to. 
(Vaughn goes to the window and looks at the helicopter crossing the compound boundary.) 
VAUGHN: Not mad Packer, merely human. 
PACKER: It's the same one! The same helicopter. 
VAUGHN: Yes. Perhaps they do mean to save their own skins, after all. Probably the helicopter's trying to pick them up. Stop them! Shoot it down if necessary! 
PACKER: Yes, sir. 
(He rushes out.)

[Rooftop]

(Jamie and the Doctor reach the top of the fire escape. The helicopter manoeuvres over them and drops the rope ladder. Jamie grabs it.) 
JAMIE: You're not going to leave the lassies by themselves are you? 
DOCTOR: No, no, of course not. Help me to get this over the side there. 
(They drop the rest of the ladder down the building, across the window to Zoe and Isobel's prison.) 
DOCTOR: Right. Down you go, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
(Jamie goes down. At one point the downdraft makes him lose his grip but he recovers.)

[Room]

ISOBEL: Something must be going on. 
ZOE: It is a helicopter. Hey, look, it's Jamie! 
ISOBEL: Oh yeah! 
ZOE: Give me a hand with this. We have to barricade the door. 
ISOBEL: Oh, yeah. 
(The girls jam a chair under the door handle) 
ZOE: Keep the guards out. Quick, bring the filing cabinet. Push. 
ISOBEL: Oh, sorry. Packer could never get through that. 
ZOE: Jamie, be careful! 
(Jamie climbs in through the window holding the end of the ladder.) 
JAMIE: Right now, quick, up you go. 
ISOBEL: Oh! You don't think we're going up that, do you? 
JAMIE: Do you want to be left here with Vaughn and Packer? Now go on! Get going. Come on, now. Watch yourself. Easy. 
(Zoe climbs out of the window and starts up the ladder.) 
JAMIE: Hang on to the ladder tightly. Whatever you do, don't let it go. And don't look down either! Right, Isobel, now you. 
(Jamie follows the mini-skirted girls up the ladder.)

[Outside the Admin building]

PACKER: Guards, follow me. 
(The girls are safely on the roof.) 
PACKER: There he is. Fire! 
(The guards open fire with automatic weapons. Jamie reaches the roof.

[Rooftop]

DOCTOR: Well done, Jamie. 
[Outside the Admin building]

PACKER: Get up there. Stop them!

[Rooftop]

ISOBEL: Oh, thank goodness that's over. 
DOCTOR: I'm afraid it isn't quite yet, Isobel. 
ISOBEL: Oh, no. 
(One at a time they start up the ladder to the helicopter.)

[Outside the Admin building]

PACKER: Come on! Get up there after them! Quickly! 
(Zoe gets on board, and Isobel is following as the Doctor dodges shrapnel from the bullets hitting the edge of the building. Then he climbs the ladder.)

[Helicopter]

DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie. Hurry up! 
(Guards have reached the rooftop and have a clear shot at Jamie.) 
DOCTOR: Get us out of here! Hold on, Jamie! 
(The helicopter gains altitude as Jamie hangs onto the ladder then climbs onboard.)

[Aeroplane]

(Gunfire is heard over the RT.) 
BRIGADIER: Jimmy! What's happening, Jimmy? Do you want ground support? 
TURNER [OC]: Hello, sir. No, mission accomplished. On our way back now. 
BRIGADIER: Splendid. No casualties? 
TURNER [OC]: No, sir. All well. Fortunately Vaughn's jackboots couldn't shoot a flying elephant. Over and out. 
BRIGADIER: All units, please, Sergeant. 
WALTERS: Yes, sir. Go ahead, sir. 
BRIGADIER: All UNIT groups. Red alert cancelled. I say again, Red alert cancelled. Return to base.

[Vaughn's office]

PACKER: That helicopter was one of the UNIT force group. I told you. 
VAUGHN: Don't panic, Packer. You've blundered again, but fortunately it won't really matter. 
PACKER: Matter? There's bound to be an official reaction. 
VAUGHN: There will be no official reaction. I've told you, we are in command. 
PACKER: But 
VAUGHN: Don't argue, Packer! Just do as you're told, man! And for once, do it right! 
PACKER: Yes, sir. 
VAUGHN: Now, I want Professor Watkins' Cerebraton machine loaded into my car. We're going back to London. 
PACKER: Back to London, sir? But you can't go back 
VAUGHN: Due to your clumsiness, Packer, we must now alter our plans. I intend to bring the invasion forward. We have twenty four hours to prepare for it. 
PACKER: Twenty four hours? But they'll never agree to it. The invasion forces aren't anywhere near complete, sir. 
VAUGHN: They'll be sufficient for our immediate purpose. After the invasion, we'll no longer have no need for secrecy. Now, you attend to the Professor and I'll deal with our UNIT friends. Bring Watkins up here to me when you're ready. 
PACKER: Yes, sir. 
(Packer leaves. Vaughn goes to his intercom.) 
VAUGHN: Get me the Ministry of Defence and switch it through to my visual circuit. 
SECRETARY [on monitor]: Good morning. Ministry of Defence. Can I help you? 
VAUGHN: Yes, get me. Ah, good morning. Major General Rutlidge, please. 
SECRETARY [on monitor]: Just one moment. Who is calling, please? 
VAUGHN: Tobias Vaughn.

[Rutlidge's office]

(Rutlidge is already on the telephone.) 
RUTLIDGE: Fine, sir, fine. We'll meet this evening for dinner, then. What? oh, about eight. Yes, at the club. Good. Fine. Goodbye, sir. 
(Rutlidge puts down the handset and it switches to line two.) 
RUTLIDGE: Yes? 
SECRETARY [OC]: Outside call for you, sir. 
RUTLIDGE: Male or female? 
SECRETARY [OC]: It's a Mister Tobias Vaughn, sir. 
RUTLIDGE: Vaughn? 
SECRETARY [OC]: Yes sir. Shall I put him through? 
RUTLIDGE: Vaughn? Yes, yes. 
SECRETARY [OC]: Just one moment. 
RUTLIDGE: Operator? 
SECRETARY [OC]: Yes, sir? 
RUTLIDGE: Priority scramble. 
SECRETARY [OC]: Yes, sir. 
(Vaughn's face appears where the dial would normally be on a telephone set.) 
VAUGHN [on monitor]: Ah, Rutlidge. Can we be overheard? 
RUTLIDGE: No, no, no. Priority scramble is in operation. 
VAUGHN [on monitor]: Good. Now listen. Your friends in the UNIT groups has been causing trouble. They must be stopped, understand? 
RUTLIDGE: I, er, I understand. 
VAUGHN [on monitor]: There must be no more interference. 
RUTLIDGE: No, no. I'll deal with it. 
VAUGHN [on monitor: Good fellow. Knew I could rely on you. 
(Transmission ends.) 
RUTLIDGE: I understand.

[Aeroplane]

BRIGADIER: You were lucky. Dead lucky. 
JAMIE: He said that it would be a simple rescue operation. Simple. 
ISOBEL: But what about my uncle? They've still got him prisoner. 
BRIGADIER: Don't worry, Miss Watkins. As soon we return to base, I'm going to raise hell and get some action. 
JAMIE: You think they'll listen to you now? 
BRIGADIER: No one, not even Tobias Vaughn, can go as far as trying to shoot down one of my helicopters. 
ISOBEL: Oh, I wished I had my camera. I could have got a fortune with those pictures. 
TURNER: Yes, it was a pity. That would have clinched it as far as the Ministry are concerned, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Don't worry, Jimmy. Billy Rutlidge will have to take some action now. 
JAMIE: Doctor? Hey, Doctor, what's the matter? 
DOCTOR: Hmm? Jamie, that object on the other side of the moon. 
BRIGADIER: Other side of the? 
ZOE: Yes. The Tardis went wrong, you see, and we had a sort of, well what, Doctor? A forced landing? 
DOCTOR: Mmm? Yeah. 
ZOE: And then they fired a missile at us. 
BRIGADIER: Who? 
ZOE: Well, whoever it was who was on that spaceship on the other side of the moon. 
BRIGADIER: Spaceships? On the other side of the Moon? 
DOCTOR: And then there was that deep space radio transmitter. I wonder. 
TURNER: Look, sir. I know this may sound ridiculous, but could those reported sightings of UFOs have anything to do with this? 
JAMIE: UFOs? What's that? 
ISOBEL: Unidentified Flying Objects. Flying saucers? 
TURNER: But these weren't saucers. All of the sightings were quite clear on that. 
DOCTOR: Did anyone, by any chance, photograph any of these objects? 
TURNER: Oh yes, we've got several in the files. Shall I get them? 
DOCTOR: Oh, if you would be so kind. 
TURNER: Right. 
DOCTOR: Unidentified Flying Objects.

[Laboratory]

WATKINS: What was that shooting going on? If you harmed Isobel 
VAUGHN: She's perfectly safe, Professor. 
WATKINS: Why am I being taken back to London? What about my niece? What's happened to Isobel? 
VAUGHN: I tell you, she's perfectly safe. 
WATKINS: Well, I want to see her! 
VAUGHN: So you shall, when you've finished working on your machine. Do as I ask and you shall both go free. 
WATKINS: You don't even expect me to believe you, do you? 
VAUGHN: Well, you've very little choice. Now, we're going back to London. There you will work on your machine to my specifications. You will have twenty four hours to complete it. Only if you hasn't finished your work by that time, would you have cause to worry about your niece. 
(Vaughn leaves.) 
PACKER: Got everything you need? 
WATKINS: Everything. 
PACKER: Come on, then. Move.

[Aeroplane]

(Top secret photographs are scattered over the map table.) 
BRIGADIER: Mean anything to you, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Possibly. How long ago were these objects first sighted? 
BRIGADIER: Reports have been drifting in for well over a year now. We sent up fighter planes to investigate, but nothing ever came of it. 
TURNER: The odd thing about these sightings is that they usually seem to disappear somewhere over south east England. 
ISOBEL: But isn't that where all those factories and laboratories of Vaughn's are? 
TURNER: Exactly. That's why I brought it up. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, when you were hiding in that crate, you say something moved? 
JAMIE: Aye, it was wrapped up in that gauze stuff. 
DOCTOR: Did you recognise it at all? 
JAMIE: No. 
ZOE: What do you think it was, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. We've got to find out and quickly. 
ZOE: How? 
DOCTOR: Well, obviously they bring these things, whatever they are, up from the factory in the country to the London premises. That's where we're going to find the answer. 
JAMIE: You mean go back to Vaughn's place? 
BRIGADIER: I don't think that's wise, Doctor. You're been lucky so far. 
JAMIE: Aye, if you think I'm going back inside there 
DOCTOR: Jamie, we have to find what is inside these crates. Brigadier, have you got a map? Including the London premises. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, yes, I think so. Sergeant Walters! 
WALTERS: Sir. 
BRIGADIER: May we have map number eight please? 
WALTERS: Yes, sir. 
TURNER: I'll get it, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Thank you. Here we are. Now this, this is the whole area in detail. London offices, warehouse area and surrounding buildings. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I see. 
JAMIE: But Doctor, you can't go back the same way again. They'll be waiting for us this time. 
DOCTOR: Oh my word. How very fortunate. 
BRIGADIER: Anything I can do to help? 
DOCTOR: Brigadier, you don't, by any chance, know where I can find a canoe?

[Canal]

(The Doctor and Jamie paddle a rigid canoe down the Regents canal leading under a bridge. 
JAMIE: Are you sure this is how we get in? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Now come on. 
(They moor the canoe by the tow path.) 
DOCTOR: Go on, I'm holding it steady. 
(The Doctor and Jamie walk up some steps and along narrow alleys, avoiding armed guards.

[Warehouse]

(The Doctor and Jamie see two men in protective suits and a white-coated scientist with one of the crates leaning against a wall, open.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, I'm afraid I was right. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
(A whirly device is switched on. It starts throbbing. A man attaches two cables to the wrapped object and the scientist turns dials. A second sound starts up and the thing inside the fabric moves. The cloth is suddenly ripped apart to reveal - a Cyberman!)

Episode Five

[Warehouse]

JAMIE: (sotto) The Cybermen. 
DOCTOR: Shush. 
JAMIE: Where do they come from? 
DOCTOR: I don't know, Jamie, but they're here, aren't they?! Come on, let's go back to the canoe. 
(They paddle back down the canal.)

[Aeroplane]

ZOE: And what do you think will happen? 
TURNER: Well, it's not really a military matter now. 
ISOBEL: You'll simply hand this over to the police. 
TURNER: More or less. 
ISOBEL: Pity. I could have got some great pictures and made a bomb selling them to the papers. Oh, well. 
TURNER: Look, perhaps I can compensate by buying you dinner. 
ISOBEL: That would be nice. Hey are you stinking rich? 
TURNER: Not on a Captain's pay, I'm not. 
ISOBEL: It's not my day, is it? 
TURNER: Money isn't everything, you know. 
(The Doctor and Jamie enter.) 
ZOE: Doctor, any luck? What did you find out? 
JAMIE: Some old friends of ours are here, Zoe. 
ZOE: Who? 
JAMIE: The Cybermen. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid it's true, Zoe. 
ZOE: That's what you suspected, wasn't it? 
ISOBEL: What on Earth are Cybermen? 
DOCTOR: They're from another world. Inhuman killers. 
TURNER: You mean they're from space, or something. 
DOCTOR + ZOE: Yes. 
ZOE: And that spaceship we saw on the other side of the Moon was obviously their craft. 
ISOBEL: What are they? Little green men? Oh, you're serious? 
ZOE: We've met Cybermen before and seen what they can do. 
TURNER: Where exactly are they and how many? 
JAMIE: At Vaughn's headquarters in London. 
DOCTOR: Oh, there's hundreds of them, possibly thousands. 
ZOE: So Vaughn's helping them. 
DOCTOR: That deep space radio transmitter is obviously being used by the Cybermen spaceships to home in on. 
TURNER: So that's what those UFOs were. But there have been hundreds of those sightings. 
JAMIE: Aye, they must have quite an army by now. The thing is, where are they hiding them all? 
DOCTOR: I don't know, Jamie. Captain, where's the Brigadier. 
TURNER: At the Ministry of Defence. I better get on to him immediately and tell him what you've discovered. 
DOCTOR: No, no, Captain. The people who went into Vaughn's headquarters were different when they came out, weren't they? 
TURNER: Yes. 
ZOE: Do you think they're being controlled, Doctor? 
TURNER: Controlled? 
ZOE: Yes, the Cybermen have means of controlling people's minds. They appear to be almost normal but they're not, they're controlled. 
DOCTOR: Who is the Brigadier is immediately answerable to? 
TURNER: Major-General Rutlidge.

[Rutlidge's office]

BRIGADIER: No cause for alarm? Billy, do you realise what's happened? They tried to shoot down one of my helicopters. 
RUTLIDGE: You were trespassing over their top security area. 
BRIGADIER: Oh, for heaven sake. If you can't trust a UNIT force, who can you trust? 
RUTLIDGE: There's nothing we 
BRIGADIER: What's the matter? 
RUTLIDGE: Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. 
BRIGADIER: Look, Billy, Vaughn's a powerful chap, I know that. But surely we can at least request a thorough investigation. 
RUTLIDGE: This isn't our province. 
BRIGADIER: Well then, who's province is it? 
RUTLIDGE: It's no good in getting angry about this. You must see this from my point of view. All you've given me is vague reports, nothing conclusive, no proof. 
BRIGADIER: No proof! 
RUTLIDGE: I'm sure this is a misunderstanding. I talk to the C in C of internal security myself. 
BRIGADIER: But Billy, talk isn't going to help. I want some sort of action, and I want it now. At least get the civil authorities to investigate. 
RUTLIDGE: You have to leave this matter with me. 
BRIGADIER: Will I? 
RUTLIDGE: If you're thinking of going to see the C in C yourself, I shouldn't bother. You'll be wasting your time. 
BRIGADIER: So you're going to do nothing? What sort of hold has Vaughn got on you? 
RUTLIDGE: Vaughn? I. Brigadier, your UNIT force will take no precipitous action without top-priority permission. That is an order. 
BRIGADIER: I see, sir. Well, you can override my authority but not that of UNIT Central Command. I'm sending a full report to them in Geneva. 
(Lethbridge-Stewart salutes and leaves. Rutlidge activates his intercom.) 
RUTLIDGE: International Electromatics, Central Office. 
SECRETARY [OC]: Just one moment please, sir. 
RUTLIDGE: Oh, er, with priority scramble. 
SECRETARY [OC]: Yes sir.

[Vaughn's office]

VAUGHN: Have Gregory work with Professor Watkins on the machine. 
PACKER: Yes, Mister Vaughn. VAUGHN: No, wait. 
(Vaughn answers his intercom.) 
VAUGHN: Report. 
MAN [OC]: Communication from Major General Rutlidge on public video. 
VAUGHN: Switch to visual circuit. What is it, Rutlidge? 
RUTLIDGE [on monitor]: The UNIT group. 
VAUGHN: Well? 
RUTLIDGE [on monitor]: There'll be trouble. I can't stop it. 
VAUGHN: Why not? You have authority to. 
RUTLIDGE [on monitor]: I have no authority outside this country. A report is being made to UNIT Central Control. They're bound to investigate and take action. 
VAUGHN: I see. How long before this will be effective? 
RUTLIDGE [on monitor]: I think I should (stops) 
VAUGHN: Rutlidge. Rutlidge! 
PACKER: What's the matter with him? 
VAUGHN: Listen to me, Rutlidge? Listen! You will obey my commands. You understand? 
RUTLIDGE [on monitor]: Your commands. 
VAUGHN: You will leave your office and come here to me. 
RUTLIDGE [on monitor]: To you. 
VAUGHN: Immediately. Do you understand? 
RUTLIDGE [on monitor]: I must. Your commands. 
VAUGHN: Do you understand? 
RUTLIDGE [on monitor] : Yes. I understand. I understand. 
VAUGHN: Good fellow. 
(Transmission ends.) 
PACKER: What was the matter with him? 
VAUGHN: Our control over him is weakening. 
PACKER: Well, that could be dangerous. If he doesn't obey your orders to come over here, he might 
VAUGHN: Oh, he will, Packer, he will.

[Aeroplane]

(Walters takes a telephone call.) 
WALTERS: Are you sure, Miss? I see. Right, thanks. Sir! 
TURNER: Got him? 
WALTERS: No sir, General Rutlidge's secretary said he left some time ago. 
TURNER: I see. What about the Brigadier? 
WALTERS: Apparently he wasn't there long, sir. He must be on his way back now. 
TURNER: Right. Doctor, it seems we're too late. The Brigadier's already been in to see Rutlidge. 
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. 
TURNER: Yes. The question is now, where exactly do we stand with Rutlidge?

[Vaughn's office]

VAUGHN: I must know, Rutlidge. You must tell me. How long? How long before the UNIT forces can take action! 
RUTLIDGE: I. One day, maybe two. 
VAUGHN: Good. Time enough. 
PACKER: Well, I don't like it. Supposing the UNIT forces move faster than that? Suppose they want to come over 
VAUGHN: Let me do the supposing, Packer. 
PACKER: Yes, Mister Vaughn. 
VAUGHN: Now, just to be on the safe side, I think we'd better conduct an experiment. 
PACKER: What do you mean? 
VAUGHN: Have the Professor's machine taken down to the warehouse. Wait outside. I'll join you later. 
PACKER: What are you going to do? 
VAUGHN: Wait and see, Packer. Wait and see. 
PACKER: Yes, sir. What about him? 
VAUGHN: Oh, leave him to me. 
(Packer leaves. Vaughn opens the secret panel.) 
VAUGHN: There has been some difficulty. We must alter our plans. 
PLANNER: Report the difficulty and we will assess it. 
VAUGHN: We must bring the invasion forward. 
PLANNER: Our invasion force is not yet complete. 
VAUGHN: The invasion must take place in fifteen hours time, otherwise we may have to face the combined forces of the entire world. 
PLANNER: Wait while the report will be assessed. 
VAUGHN: You will accept what I say or our partnership is at an end. The invasion will take place at dawn tomorrow. 
PLANNER: It has been agreed. The data will be computed and the invasion details transmitted to you. Discussion terminated.

[Warehouse]

(More Cybermen are being reactivated.) 
PACKER: How many more? 
WORKMAN: About fifty more crates. 
PACKER: Hurry it up. 
WORKMAN: Yes, sir. 
(Packer opens a secret door in a nearby brick wall.) 
PACKER: Follow me.

[Secret room]

(Packer goes up a wooden staircase.) 
PACKER: Have you received your instructions? 
CYBERMEN: Yes. 
PACKER: You will proceed through the sewer tunnels to your allotted sectors. There you will obey the commands of your sector leader. 
CYBERMEN: We understand. 
PACKER: Proceed.

[Aeroplane]

(The Doctor has a diagram labelled Main Drainage.) 
DOCTOR: You see, a network of tunnels underneath London. 
BRIGADIER: And that's where you think they might be? 
DOCTOR: Yes. And look. There's a main flood relief sewer running right underneath the warehouse. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, but if there's water in the sewers, wouldn't that affect them? 
DOCTOR: Oh no, no. Besides, many of these tunnels are dry and only flood during heavy rainfall. 
ISOBEL: What do we do, pray for a cloudburst? 
BRIGADIER: Miss Watkins, this could be very serious. 
ISOBEL: I'm sorry, but, well, it's a pretty fantastic story to swallow. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, but so was the attack from the Yeti, but nevertheless it happened. 
TURNER: With all due respect sir, she's right. No one believed in the Yetis until they saw them. If you go to Central Command with this story, they'll think you're mad. 
BRIGADIER: Yes. Yes, Jimmy, you're right. Of course, what we really need is some sort of evidence, some proof. 
DOCTOR: It might be better at the moment to find out what form this attack's going to take. Jamie? 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: That transistor radio that Vaughn gave you. Have you still got it? 
JAMIE: Aye, here. 
(Jamie hands it over and the Doctor starts to dismantle it.) 
DOCTOR: Brigadier, have you any IE equipment here? 
BRIGADIER: Er, Jimmy, have we? 
JIMMY: Yes, we have, sir. A computer and various radio and radar components. 
DOCTOR: May I see them, please? 
BRIGADIER: Certainty. Jimmy, would you? 
TURNER: I'll show you, Doctor. This way 
DOCTOR: Thank you.

[Warehouse]

(Packer watches Cybermen carefully go down a manhole in the secret room, then goes back out to the warehouse proper.) 
VAUGHN: Ah, there you are, Packer. Everything going well? 
PACKER: Yes, Mister Vaughn. 
VAUGHN: Good. Time for our little experiment. 
GREGORY: Mister Vaughn, I don't think you should 
VAUGHN: We must try the machine, Gregory. 
GREGORY: But it's dangerous. 
VAUGHN: It would be even more dangerous if we didn't try it. We must make sure we have an effective weapon against the Cybermen. 
PACKER: You're going to try it on one of them? 
VAUGHN: Why not? 
(Vaughn goes up to a crate.) 
VAUGHN: Revive it just enough to bring it out of its cocoon. 
TECHNICIAN: Yes, sir. 
(The technicians attach the cables to the cocoon then switch on the machine. The Cyberman rips open the material.) 
VAUGHN: Hold it there. Now, Gregory, connect the Professor's machine. 
(Gregory puts a box on the floor and holds a cable nervously.) 
GREGORY: Mister Vaughn, please. 
VAUGHN: Connect it! 
(Gregory puts the 'stethoscope' attachment onto the Cyberman's head, picks up his box and backs away.) 
GREGORY: What emotion shall I induce? 
VAUGHN: Fear. Let's see how the Cybermen will react to fear. 
(Gregory switches on his box.) 
Increase the power. 
(The Cyberman starts to sway and make groaning electronic noises.) 
VAUGHN: More power! 
GREGORY: That's all there is. 
(The Cyberman rips the attachment from its head and staggers around, flailing its arms. Guards shoot at it to no effect.) 
PACKER: Quick! 
The humans get out of its way as the Cyberman staggers into the secret room.) 
GREGORY: I warned you, the machine isn't ready yet. It's following the others into the sewers. 
VAUGHN: Let it go. 
PACKER: It's gone mad. It could have killed us all. 
VAUGHN: Possibly, but I think we've proved that the Professor's machine can be effective. Get him to work on it, Gregory. I want twice as much power and I want directional control. 
PACKER: Yeah, but what about that one? You can't let it roam down there alone! 
VAUGHN: Why not? 
PACKER: Well, it'll kill anything that gets in its way. 
VAUGHN: Good. Anyone fool enough to be down in those sewers deserves to die.

[Aeroplane]

ISOBEL: Now you really believe that these Cybermen things are down in the sewers. 
BRIGADIER: Seems to make sense. 
ISOBEL: But you can't do anything about it without proof or evidence. 
BRIGADIER: Central Command would think I was mad. 
ISOBEL: Well, the answer's simple, surely. Go and get some proof. 
BRIGADIER: And how do I prove that in the sewers of London there are creatures from outer space waiting to attack us. Go and get one? 
ZOE: You wouldn't stand a chance against them, Isobel. 
ISOBEL: Ah, you wouldn't have to go anywhere near them. Photograph them. 
BRIGADIER: That's not a bad idea. Now, wait a minute, it'd be pitch dark down in those tunnels. 
ISOBEL: You could use an infrared film, a twenty five filter on a thirty five mil camera with a telephoto lens, and why, you could take frame after frame without getting anywhere near them. 
BRIGADIER: Is that all gibberish or do you really know what you're talking about? 
ISOBEL: Of course I know. 
BRIGADIER: If you're right, it could well be the sort of proof I need to get some action. 
ISOBEL: Well, all I need is my cameras from the house and then I'm all set. 
BRIGADIER: Now, wait a minute, This is hardly a job for you. 
ISOBEL: Why ever not? 
BRIGADIER: Well, you're a young woman. This is a job for my men. 
ISOBEL: Well, of all the bigoted, anti-feminist, cretinous remarks 
BRIGADIER: This is no job for a girl like you. Now that's final. 
ISOBEL: Oh, you, you, you man! 
BRIGADIER: I'll get in touch with my photographic unit and get them onto it. 
ISOBEL: Oh, that stupid bigoted idiotic 
JAMIE: Aye, well, he's right, you know. 
ZOE: Jamie McCrimmon! 
JAMIE: Well, he is. 
ZOE: Just because you're a man you think that you're superior, do you? 
JAMIE: Now, I didn't say that. Of course, it's true. 
ZOE: Is it really? Right. Coming, Isobel? 
ISOBEL: What a splendid idea. 
JAMIE: Where are you going? 
ZOE: Do you think we should let him come with us? 
ISOBEL: Oh, I don't know. Men aren't much good in situations like this. 
JAMIE: Just a moment. Where are you're going? 
ISOBEL: London. Coming? 
JAMIE: London? Now we shouldn't do anything without the Doctor! Och. 
(Isobel and Zoe leave, followed by Jamie. In another section of the big Hercules transport -) 
DOCTOR: This is rather like looking for the proverbial needle in the proverbial. Just a minute 
TURNER: Found something? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. Wait a minute. 
(The Doctor pulls a small computer chip from a piece of UNIT equipment.) 
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I'm almost sure that this is same sort of circuit that was in Jamie's radio. 
TURNER: But what does it do? 
DOCTOR: I've no idea. But it's certainly not part of that equipment. Have a look. 
TURNER: But why put it a circuit if it doesn't do anything. 
DOCTOR: Oh, it does something, all right. The question is what?

[Vaughn's office]

PLANNER: One hour before invasion, the Cyber-transmitter units will be launched into orbit around Earth. 
VAUGHN: The effect will be immediate? 
PLANNER: Yes. Transmissions will penetrate all areas. 
VAUGHN: And if it doesn't work? 
PLANNER: Humans cannot resist Cyber-control. Our forces will penetrate all areas and select suitable humans for cybernetic conversion. 
VAUGHN: Conversion to Cybermen? 
PLANNER: Yes. The unsuitable humans will be destroyed. 
VAUGHN: No! This is not as we agreed! 
PLANNER: It has been decided. 
VAUGHN: We agreed that I should remain in control of Earth. In return, I supply the minerals you require. You will honour that bargain, otherwise there will be no invasion! 
PLANNER: To control, you must undergo complete conversion and become one of us. 
VAUGHN: No! My body may be cybernetic but my mind stays human. That is final! 
PLANNER: It has been agreed. Discussion concluded. 
(Vaughn closes the secret panel.) 
PACKER: You don't trust them? 
VAUGHN: Of course not. I know they'll try to take control from me when the invasion's complete, but then, they don't know about the Cerebraton Machine, do they? 
PACKER: Well, I don't like it. That thing just said humans can't resist control. How do we know these Cyber-transmissions aren't going to affect us? 
VAUGHN: They won't. We shall be protected by the implanted audio-rejection capsules. You see, Packer, I've thought all this out in detail. Nothing has been overlooked.

[Aeroplane]

TURNER: Found anything? 
DOCTOR: No, I'm afraid not. What I really need is laboratory facilities. I'm sure that this micro-monolithic circuit is something to do with the Cybermen's invasion plan. 
TURNER: Perhaps we can find a lab for you to work in. 
DOCTOR: Oh, no, that's no problem, I can go up to London and use Professor Watkins' laboratory at Travers's house. 
TURNER: Right. I'll arrange transport. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
(Turner peers at the circuit in Jamie's transistor radio. Meanwhile, the Brigadier is on the RT.) 
BRIGADIER: I'll arrange for a helicopter to transport the photographic detail here for a briefing. Over. 
MAN [OC]: Very good, sir. They'll be standing by. Out. 
DOCTOR: Brigadier? 
BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Where's Jamie and Zoe and Isobel. 
BRIGADIER: I've no idea. Sergeant Walters? 
WALTERS: Yes, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Friends of the Doctors. Any idea where they are? 
WALTERS: They took a van and went back to London, sir. 
DOCTOR: London? What on earth for? 
WALTERS: Well, they said that they were going to get something important for the Brigadier, sir. 
BRIGADIER: For me? 
WALTERS: Yes, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Oh, no, they surely couldn't have been so stupid as. Sergeant Walters. 
WALTERS: Sir? 
BRIGADIER: Get Benton on the radio link. 
WALTERS: Yes, sir. 
DOCTOR: What's the matter? What's happened? 
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, Doctor, but I think those crazy kids have gone off to the sewers to get photos of the Cybermen! 
DOCTOR: What?

[Street]

(Corporal Benton is now in a UNIT uniform. He parks the Land Rover Jeep by a meter. Isobel has got a camera with her.) 
JAMIE: Well, at least let's call the Doctor up first. 
ZOE: Scared, Jamie? 
JAMIE: No. I mean, I don't even know what we're going to do. 
ISOBEL: Well, come on then. 
JAMIE: Och. Women. 
(Isobel, Zoe and Jamie leave Benton in the jeep.) 
RADIO [OC]: UNIT transport car two three report in, over. 
(BENTON picks up the microphone to his radio.) 
BENTON: Car two three to UNIT command. Receiving you, over.

[Aeroplane]

WALTERS: There you are, sir. 
BRIGADIER: This is the Brigadier. Have you still got your passengers? 
BENTON [OC]: No, sir. I've just dropped them. 
BRIGADIER: Your position. 
BENTON [OC]: In the vicinity of Red sector one, sir. Shepherd Street. 
WALTERS: That's almost on top of Vaughn's HQ, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Benton, listen. Try and make contact with your passengers again and get them to report in to me. 
BENTON [OC]: I'll try, sir, but I'm not sure which way they've gone. 
BRIGADIER: Don't make excuses, Benton. This is a top priority alert. Out. (to Walters) Thank you. Jimmy, I want you to take charge of this operation. Get over there at once, will you? 
TURNER: Right, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Sergeant. 
DOCTOR: I'd better go back to London with him and see if I can make some sort of sense of these circuits. I'm going to have to leave my three friends in your very capable hands. 
BRIGADIER: Don't worry, Doctor. We'll get them back. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
(The Doctor leaves.) 
BRIGADIER: I hope.

[Sewers]

(At the junction of Fore Street and Moor Lane, a manhole cover clangs onto the tarmac. The City of London is so easy to film in on a Sunday.) 
JAMIE [OC]: Third time lucky. 
ZOE: Good. Go on, then, Jamie. Down we go. 
JAMIE: Me? But, er. Och. 
(Jamie climbs down the ladder, not looking up at Zoe's knickers.) 
ZOE: Right, come on, Isobel. 
JAMIE: Shush! 
ZOE: Lower your camera down to me.

[Fore Street]

(A policeman walks past the Post Office - not there now - and calls to Isobel as she sits in the open manhole.) 
POLICEMAN: Hey you! What do you think you're doing going down there for, you young idiots! 
(Isobel goes down the ladder. Benton arrives in the jeep and goes over to the policeman.) 
POLICEMAN: Hey, you kids! Come on out of there, or I'll come down after you.

[Sewers]

POLICEMAN [OC]: I know you're down there. Are you going to come up or do I have to come down to fetch you. 
JAMIE: (sotto) That's all we need. If he carrying on shouting like that we'll have every Cyberman in the area on top of us. 
ZOE: Shush. Jamie, look. I think that there's something further down the tunnel. 
ISOBEL: I can't see anything. Just in case, though. 
JAMIE: I think that we better get back. Come on. 
ZOE: Oh Jamie, look! I was right! 
(A silver figure casts a shadow on the curved brick wall.) 
ISOBEL: Fantastic. 
(Isobel steps forward and starts taking photographs.) 
JAMIE: Come on, back. 
(The policeman has climbed down ladder and is shining his torch around.) 
POLICEMAN: Right, you kids, where are you? Come on now, stop playing about. Are you down there, then? 
(Further along, Isobel is taking pictures.) 
POLICEMAN [OC]: Come on, come on. I know that you're down here somewhere. 
JAMIE: Come on, you're just risking our necks. 
ISOBEL: Just a couple more 
JAMIE: There isn't time. Come on! Out. 
(The policeman has gone a different direction from our group.) 
POLICEMAN: Come on, come on. You'll get lost if you go wandering about down there. Come on. What the heck? 
(Two Cyberman stand in front of the policeman. One uses its chest unit to kill him.) 
ISOBEL: The policeman! 
ZOE: They've killed him! 
JAMIE: Right, come on! 
ZOE: Oh, Jamie, no! 
JAMIE: What? 
ZOE: Don't you realise? We can't go back that way. 
JAMIE: And we can't go that way. That Cyberman's after. Yes, they're coming at us from both directions. 
(The Cyberman behind them is the one that Vaughn has made crazed with fear.)

Episode Six

[Fore Street]

(Another jeep has arrived. Benton is at the open manhole.) 
BENTON: Down here sir. 
TURNER: Sergeant, get the torch.

[Sewers]

ZOE: What are we going to do? 
JAMIE: Back! Against the wall! 
(Jamie shields Zoe and Isobel, but the demented Cyberman goes straight past them, wailing.) 
ZOE: He ignored us. 
JAMIE: It's out of control. It's sort of wild. 
(At the bottom of the manhole, armed soldiers are gathering. The demented Cyberman can be heard.) 
WALTERS: (sotto) Come on, lads, let's hurry it up. 
BENTON: What's that noise, sir? 
TURNER: I don't know. Come on, let's try this way. (a little way along) Isobel, where are you? Jamie? 
(Further along.) 
TURNER [OC]: This is Captain Turner! Where are you? 
ISOBEL: That's him. Somebody's coming. I told you. 
JAMIE: No, wait. There are Cybermen between us, remember. 
ISOBEL: What are we going to do? We just can't wait here. Some more might come along. 
TURNER [OC]: Are you down there? 
ISOBEL: Look, at least let him know we're here. 
JAMIE: Aye, and the other Cybermen too. 
(Back with the soldiers.) 
TURNER: Not a sound. 
WALTERS: Reckon they copped it as well, sir? 
TURNER: Can't be sure, that's the trouble. 
WALTERS: Aye, these sewers are a right maze. They could be anywhere. 
TURNER: Yes. We'd better get in touch with the Brigadier immediately. 
(They turn to head back.) 
TURNER: What the? WALTERS: Sir, what 
(The pair of Cybermen are coming up the tunnel.) 
TURNER: Move back, all of you slowly. 
CYBERMAN: Do not move! 
TURNER: Sergeant, grenades. 
WALTERS: Yes, sir. 
CYBERMAN: Do not resist. You will obey instructions. 
TURNER: What do you want us to do? 
CYBERMAN: You will come with us. Obey. 
(Walters hands a grenade to Turner.) 
WALTERS: Ready sir. 
CYBERMAN: Obey or you will be destroyed. 
(The demented Cyberman comes up behind the pair as Walters prepares to throw his grenade.) 
TURNER: Wait. 
(The pair turn to deal with their flailing brother.) 
TURNER: Now! 
(Turner and Walters throw their grenades.) 
TURNER: Get down! 
(Boom, Boom. One Cyberman gets up again.) 
TURNER: And again, Sergeant. 
WALTERS: Grenade, quick! Come on, Perkins, Come on. 
PERKINS: It's too late, Sergeant. I'm getting out! 
(Private Perkins runs away.) 
TURNER: Perkins! Come back, man! 
(The Cyberman uses its chest unit on Perkins, killing him. Further along -) 
ISOBEL: Oh, at least we should have warned them. 
(Boom. Boom. Boom.) 
TURNER [OC]: Isobel, Jamie, Zoe! Are you down there? 
JAMIE, ZOE + ISOBEL: Yes! 
ISOBEL: Yes, we are! 
TURNER [OC]: Get to the ladder as quickly as you can. 
JAMIE: Right. 
(By the ladder.) 
TURNER: Come on, hurry it up. Come on, Sergeant, keep those men moving. Get the body here quickly. 
ISOBEL: Oh, thank goodness. 
TURNER: Shut up! Come on, get out of here and keep out of the way. I've already lost one man and I don't want to lose anymore. Now up that ladder. Get moving! Jamie, are there any more behind you? 
JAMIE: No. 
TURNER: Good. Right, get the body up. Jamie, keep a good look out. I think one of those Cybermen is still alive.

[Fore Street]

(Jamie is the last man out.) 
TURNER: Quickly! All right, I'm with you. 
(But a silver hand grabs Jamie's ankle as he gets out.) 
JAMIE: My leg! 
TURNER: All right. Hold on, Jamie! 
(The Cyberman struggles with both Jamie and Turner.) 
TURNER: Sergeant! 
(Walters grabs a rifle and hits the Cyberman with the butt repeatedly. Eventually it lets go of Jamie and goes back down the ladder.) 
WALTERS: That's it. Got it, got it. 
TURNER: Benton, grenade! 
BENTON [OC]: Coming, sir! 
TURNER: Quick, man! 
WALTERS: Hurry! 
(Benton pulls the pin from a grenade and drops it down the manhole. Boom!) 
WALTERS: I just don't believe it, sir. All them grenades and he still came out of it. 
TURNER: Yes. Come on, let's get out of here.

[Laboratory]

(In Travers' house, the Doctor is peering into a microscope.) 
BRIGADIER: Any success? 
DOCTOR: No, not yet. There's an alien logic in these circuits but I haven't been able to work it out yet. 
BRIGADIER: So we're no further ahead. 
DOCTOR: No, not yet. 
BRIGADIER: Miss Watkins is developing her photographs. I'm taking a full report to Geneva and UNIT Central Command. 
DOCTOR: How long will that take? 
BRIGADIER: Depends. I leave in the morning. If I can get the report to the Council tomorrow we should get some action within two or three days. 
DOCTOR: But that might be too late! 
(Isobel enters.) 
ISOBEL: Here we are. Some beauties. 
(Jamie and Zoe enter. Isobel shows her prints to the Brigadier.) 
BRIGADIER: Yes. 
ISOBEL: What's the matter? 
BRIGADIER: Nothing. They're very good. I don't want to hurt your professional pride, Miss Watkins, but they do look a little like fakes. 
ISOBEL: Fakes? 
(The photographs are blurred.) 
ZOE: Yes, I see what you mean. 
ISOBEL: Oh, charming, I don't know why I bothered. 
(Isobel leaves.) 
JAMIE: Of course they're Cybermen. Any fool can see that. 
BRIGADIER: Well, you do, McCrimmon. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
BRIGADIER: You know them. 
JAMIE: Oh. 
BRIGADIER: The people I'm trying to convince are a little more sceptical. 
DOCTOR: Yes of course! 
JAMIE: What? 
BRIGADIER: What? 
DOCTOR: It could be, it just could be.

[Vaughn's office]

PACKER: It was definitely the UNIT force. They attacked three Cybermen and destroyed two of them. 
VAUGHN: How very clever of them. 
PACKER: They got out alive. Now if they report on what they saw 
VAUGHN: Their reports will be meaningless, Packer. In a few hours time the invasion will be complete. There cannot possibly be any serious opposition. 
PACKER: Well, I hope you're right. 
VAUGHN: I am, Packer, I am. Just look at it out there. Soon we shall control all that. Has the Professor completed his work on the Cerebraton Mentor machine? 
PACKER: Yes. Gregory's bringing him now. 
(Door bell.) 
PACKER: That'll be them. 
(Packer opens the door. Watkins is carrying the box, Gregory and a guard right behind him.) 
VAUGHN: Ah, come in gentlemen. Well, Gregory, success? 
GREGORY: I don't know yet, sir. We've added narrow bandwidth transducers. Should make transmission more directional. 
VAUGHN: Good, good. Show me. 
WATKINS: This is madness. That machine is a deadly weapon now. 
VAUGHN: Really? 
WATKINS: The modifications were quite unnecessary. It worked perfectly well as it was. 
VAUGHN: For your purposes, perhaps, Professor. I have a somewhat different use for it. 
WATKINS: All right, all right. Do with it what you will. The machine's yours now. Now, will you let me get out of this place? And let Isobel go free as you promise? 
VAUGHN: But my dear fellow, she is free. 
WATKINS: Free? Where? Where is she? 
VAUGHN: Probably sitting quite comfortably at home. Now then, how does one operate this? 
GREGORY: Careful, Mister Vaughn. Don't point it at anyone. 
VAUGHN: No? Dangerous is it? Fear, Watkins. Do you know what fear is? 
WATKINS: No, don't! Don't do that! Don't! 
(Vaughn switches the machine on with its trumpet pointing at Watkins, who tenses up in pain and fear.) 
GREGORY: Mister Vaughn, you'll kill him! Stop! 
VAUGHN: Perhaps we should try the effects of the machine on you, Gregory! At full power! 
GREGORY: No, no, Mister Vaughn. I was only afraid that if we still needed the Professor 
VAUGHN: I'm aware of that. Unfortunately I suppose that I still need you, otherwise I. (to guard) Pick him up. 
(Gregory and the guard hold Watkins up.) 
VAUGHN: Professor, you'll be taken back to the factory compound. I want these machines on the production lines immediately. Do you understand? 
WATKINS: Vaughn, obviously I can't choose but to work for you. If I refuse, you'll torture me or kill me. I know I can't stand up to torture, and I don't want to die. You're an evil man, Vaughn. You're sadistic. You're a megalomaniac. You're insane. I pity you, but if I get half a chance, I'll kill you. 
VAUGHN: Kill me? Would you? Give me your gun, Packer. 
(Shades of Richard III by Shakespeare. Packer gives Vaughn his pistol. Vaughn points it at Watkin's head then turns it round and offers it to the little man.) 
VAUGHN: Take it. There you are. Take it. 
(Vaughn puts the gun in Watkins' hand. Gregory and Packer and the guard back away.) 
VAUGHN: Now you're free to shoot me, Professor. Shoot. Shoot! 
(Vaughn knocks Watkins down.) 
VAUGHN: Come on, the gun's loaded, or haven't you got the courage to pull the trigger? 
(Watkins gets up and fires three times, point blank, then faints. Vaughn has three smoking holes in his shirt, but is standing there laughing.) 
VAUGHN: Take him away. Get work started on the machine immediately.

[Laboratory]

(Isobel enters with three mugs on a tray. Turner looks around and smiles.) 
ISOBEL: Tea, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. 
(Jamie is sleeping in a chair.) 
ISOBEL: Jamie. Jamie, tea. 
(She puts his mug on the floor.) 
TURNER: Captain Turner calling UNIT Control. Captain Turner calling UNIT Control. How do you read me, over? 
WALTERS [OC]: UNIT Control. Loud and clear, sir. Over. 
TURNER: Relay all important messages and reports direct through to here, Sergeant. Over. 
WALTERS [OC]: Wilco. Over. 
TURNER: Good. Over and out. Thanks. 
ISOBEL: I'm forgiven then? 
TURNER: What? 
ISOBEL: For being such a twit and going down those sewers. I'm sorry about the soldier. 
TURNER: Yes, well, it's all right. You weren't to know what you were really letting yourself in for. 
ISOBEL: Why, I would have got us all killed. I just didn't realise. I mean, those Cybermen things. I've just been listening to Zoe telling the Brigadier all about them for his report, and they really do sound as murderous as they look. 
TURNER: You know, we dropped five grenades right on top of them and one of them still came out of it. I'd hate to have to fight a whole army of them. 
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no! 
JAMIE: What's the matter, Doctor? Would someone mind telling me what's going on? 
TURNER: Don't worry, Jamie. Finish your tea and go back to sleep. 
WALTERS [OC]: UNIT Control to CO. UNIT Control to CO. Over. 
TURNER: Captain Turner here, Sergeant. Stand by. Isobel, will you get the Brigadier for me? 
ISOBEL: Oh, sure. 
(ISOBEL runs out of the room.) 
TURNER: Brigadier's on his way now, Sergeant. What's the flap? Over. 
WALTERS [OC]: Report from Red sector one, sir, at twenty thirty hours 
(Isobel meets the Brigadier at the door.) 
TURNER: Hold on a sec. Right, the Brigadier's listening now. Go ahead, Sergeant. 
WALTERS [OC]: Benton on routine observation reports two guards and another man leaving with the Professor. He's on their tail now, sir. Over. 
TURNER: Hold on, Sergeant. Look, sir, we could intercept and release the Professor. 
BRIGADIER: Well, officially we 
ISOBEL: Oh do. Please, do. 
DOCTOR: Brigadier, if you could rescue him, he might be able to help us with our problem. 
BRIGADIER: All right. Your shindig Jimmy. 
TURNER: Sergeant, tell Benton to stay with them. I'm on my way now. I'll contact him on route. Over. 
WALTERS [OC]: Wilco. Over. 
BRIGADIER: Jimmy, don't take any chances. Vaughn's lot know we mean business so they won't be playing games. 
TURNER: No, sir, neither will I. I'll take the full assault platoon with me. 
BRIGADIER: Right. 
TURNER: Sergeant, alert the full assault platoon. I'll relay instructions on route. Have you got that, over? 
WALTERS [OC]: Yes, sir. Over. 
TURNER: Good. Over and out. 
ISOBEL: Good luck. 
TURNER: Thanks. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, good luck, Jimmy. 
TURNER: Sir. (Turner leaves.) 
TURNER: I think Mister Vaughn is going to have quite a scrap on his hands.

[Vaughn's office]

GREGORY: There were at least thirty of them, all UNIT men and all armed, Mister Vaughn. We didn't stand a chance. Out of nowhere. They just came out of nowhere. 
VAUGHN: And they just took the Professor? 
GREGORY: What could we do? There were at least 
VAUGHN: Thirty of them, you say? 
GREGORY: It was hopeless. They shot the two guards, and they'd have shot me if 
VAUGHN: If you hadn't run away. 
GREGORY: Well, yes. 
VAUGHN: You realise of course that without the Professor's assistance it will not be possible to get the Cerebraton Machine on the production line. 
GREGORY: No, Mister Vaughn, I can. Given a little time, I'm sure I can! 
VAUGHN: But you have no time, Gregory. No time at all.

[Sewers]

PACKER: Kill him! 
(Two Cybermen use their chest units on the fleeing Gregory.)

[Laboratory]

WATKINS: I'm sorry. I can't tell you. 
DOCTOR: (You've no idea what these micro-monolithic circuits are for. 
WATKINS: No. 
DOCTOR: Oh, my word. 
WATKINS: I couldn't understand why Vaughn wanted the modifications to the machine. 
DOCTOR: You say he's going to mass produce these machines? 
WATKINS: Yes. 
BRIGADIER: Why should he want a weapon like that if he's got the Cybermen to fight for him? 
DOCTOR: I've no idea. Unless. Professor! You say that you developed this machine to produce excessively powerful emotional pulses. 
WATKINS: Yes, that's true. 
DOCTOR: Well, that's it! Vaughn going to use it as a weapon against the Cybermen once he has no further use for them. 
BRIGADIER: What, the Professor's machine? 
DOCTOR: Yes. Emotion is alien to the Cybermen's nervous system. It'll destroy it. The micro-monolithic circuits. They're emotional circuits! No wonder they weren't logical. Now why didn't I think of this before. Now, let's see. 
(The Doctor goes to the microscope.) 
JAMIE: Now what's he up to? 
ZOE: I've no idea. 
WATKINS: Doctor. Doctor. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, look, Jimmy, I'd better get back to Control. I leave for Geneva at dawn. If the Doctor should come up with anything, let me know. 
TURNER: Right, sir. 
JAMIE: Oh. Oh well, if anything exciting happens, wake me up, will you? I was in the middle of a lovely dream. 
ZOE: Honestly, Jamie. Cybermen underneath London and all you can think about is your sleep. 
(More pairs of Cybermen are dispersing through the sewers. Some of them are carrying ray guns. Later - ) 
ZOE: Jamie. Jamie, wake up. 
JAMIE: Och, there's no peace. What is it? 
ZOE: The Doctor discovered something important. Come on! 
DOCTOR: Let's hope it isn't. Oh, how do you do, Jamie? Now then, here is the Earth. And here is the Moon. 
(The Doctor points to a rough drawing he has made on a piece of board.) 
DOCTOR: And these are the communication satellites circling the Earth. And here is the Cybermen's spaceship, the invasion spaceship, the one that we saw. Right, now if I'm right, I think that this will come to this side of the Moon and boost signals to the Earth. 
WATKINS: The signals will activate these circuits. 
DOCTOR: Precisely. 
ZOE: But you still haven't told us what that will do. 
DOCTOR: The micro-monolithic circuits are artificial nervous systems. Once activated they will produce the Cyber-hypnotic force that controls human beings. 
TURNER: But there are hundreds, thousands of these circuits in IE equipment all over the world. 
WATKINS: Exactly. 
ISOBEL: So everybody will come under their control. 
ZOE: Yes, the Cybermen will take over everybody. 
TURNER: Well, isn't there anything we can do? 
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a way to block the signals, isn't there, Zoe. 
ZOE: The depolariser. Worn at the back of the neck, it will jam the Cyber-control waves. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Have you any neuristors here, Professor? 
WATKINS: Well, a few, I think. 
DOCTOR: Zoe, I want you to show the Professor what to do. The invasion could come at any moment.

[Vaughn's office]

(A buzzer sounds. Vaughn opens the secret panel.) 
PLANNER: Is all in readiness? 
VAUGHN: Of course. 
PLANNER: There is one hour to invasion time. Countdown will start from now. 
VAUGHN: Excellent. 
PLANNER: We are moving into position now. Ready to transmit the Cyber-signal. 
[Laboratory]

DOCTOR: Brigadier, they must all be fitted once. The invasion could come at any moment. 
BRIGADIER [OC]: I'll get all UNIT groups onto it as soon as possible, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Good. Good. If you want any help, just call me up. 
BRIGADIER [OC]: Will do. Out. 
DOCTOR: Now then, now many have you made, Zoe? 
ZOE: Only three, I'm afraid. We couldn't find any more neuristors. 
DOCTOR: What? There must be some more amongst all this gubbins. Come on, let's have a look. We must protect everyone here at least. Now search, everybody. Come along.

[Vaughn's office]

PLANNER: We are proceeding to our position now. Transmitter will be ready in thirty minutes. 
(Packer enters.) 
VAUGHN: A few minutes, Packer. A few minutes and then I shall control the world. 
PACKER: You? You're sure? 
VAUGHN: Quite certain, Packer. Quite certain.

[Isobel's room]

(Daybreak in London. Stock photographs of Australia House, St Pauls Cathedral as birds sing.) 
TURNER: Penny for them? 
ISOBEL: It's all so peaceful. 
TURNER: Do you think the Doctor could be wrong this time? I mean about the invasion. 
ISOBEL: Well, he's been right up to now. 
TURNER: Yes, true, but, well, I don't know. Look. 
ISOBEL: Yeah, I know what you mean. Why, it's just incredible, isn't it? Looking at all that peace out there, it's so difficult to imagine. 
(An electronic sound starts up.) 
ISOBEL: What's that noise?

[Laboratory]

(Fashion note - Zoe is back in the glitter cat suit. The Doctor grabs the back of his neck.) 
DOCTOR: Zoe, my depolariser. It must have fallen off! 
(The Doctor collapses.) 
ZOE: Oh Professor, get a depolarizer, quickly. 
(A businessman walking along Distaff Lane grabs at the concrete lattice wall. A woman puts her hands over her ears. A car driver passes out, resting on the horn. A man cleaning the gates of the College of Arms looks up in horror.) 
ZOE: Quickly! 
(Zoe puts a depolariser on the back of the Doctor's neck.) 
ZOE: Doctor! Doctor! 
ISOBEL: Is he all right? 
ZOE: I don't know. 
ISOBEL: Oh, whatever is that noise? 
JAMIE [OC]: Doctor? Doctor! 
(Jamie and Turner enter.) 
JAMIE: Hey! 
ISOBEL: What is it? What's happened? 
TURNER: It's the Cybermen. We've just seen hundreds coming out of the sewers. 
(Cybermen march down St Peter's Steps, along Knightrider Street and Queen Victoria Street as the Cyber-signal hypnotises the humans.)

Episode Seven

[Laboratory]

(The Doctor starts to wake up, groaning.) 
ISOBEL: Oh, are you all right, Doctor? 
JAMIE: Doctor! The invasion, it's begun. 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, I rather gathered that. Is everyone else all right? 
ALL: Yes. 
ISOBEL: We're fine. 
DOCTOR: Oh, what about the Brigadier, and the rest of the men? 
TURNER: I'll check. 
JAMIE: Are you all right to stand up now? 
ISOBEL: Come on, up you get. 
TURNER: Captain Turner calling UNIT Control. Captain Turner calling UNIT Control. Are you receiving me? Over. Are you receiving me? Over, 
WALTERS [OC]: UNIT control receiving you. Over. 
TURNER: Sergeant, is the Brigadier there? 
WALTERS [OC]: Hold on a moment, sir. 
BRIGADIER [OC]: Here, Jimmy. Are you all right? 
TURNER: Yes, sir. 
BRIGADIER [OC]: Well, chaos here. Only half the crew recovered so far. 
DOCTOR: Brigadier, what about the rest of the UNIT men? 
BRIGADIER [OC]: Well, hard to say. Reports still coming in. Look, I'll send transport for you. You'll be safer here with us. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. 
BRIGADIER [OC]: Jimmy? 
DOCTOR: Jamie? 
TURNER: Yes, sir, I heard. 
BRIGADIER [OC]: Right. Now stay put. As far as I can gather, the streets are packed with Cybermen. Sergeant Walters will try to get through with a jeep. 
TURNER: Right, sir. Over and out. Well, sounds like total success for Vaughn and the Cybermen. 
DOCTOR: Yes. We appear to be sitting right in the middle of the hornet's nest.

[Vaughn's office]

(Vaughn is writing on a clipboard.) 
PLANNER: All areas are now covered by our transmission. The full invasion force is preparing for flight. Transmit the radio beam for the transporter ships to home on. 
VAUGHN: It will be prepared. 
PLANNER: Control and supervision of Cybermen in all key positions will be arranged. Prepare your communication network. 
VAUGHN: Wait. My organisation will now take over. The Cyberman army must stay under my control. 
PLANNER: Why do you oppose us. 
VAUGHN: I don't oppose you. We're allies. But you do not understand the world and it's organisation. I do. 
PLANNER: This is not necessary. Humans are now under Cyber-control. 
VAUGHN: I must control them! Look, let's understand one another. You will not get what you want unless I too achieve my object. Is this agreed? 
PLANNER: It has been agreed. 
VAUGHN: Good! Then the invasion will continue under my direction. Discussion terminated. 
(Vaughn closes the secret panel.) 
VAUGHN: Packer! 
PACKER [on monitor]: Yes sir. 
VAUGHN: Have you discovered where the Professor is? 
PACKER [on monitor]: Yes, Mister Vaughn. 
VAUGHN :Go and collect him. 
PACKER [on monitor]: But sir, the UNIT people. 
VAUGHN: You won't meet with any resistance. They're all under Cyber-control. 
PACKER [on monitor]: Right, Mister Vaughn. 
VAUGHN: I want work started on the production of the machines immediately. Go and recapture Watkins. Don't let anything or anyone stop you.

[Hallway]

(An army jeep pulls up in front of Travers' house. Walters grabs a rifle, runs up to the front door and rings the bell. Turner lets him in, pistol ready.) 
WALTERS: Oh, thanks, sir. 
TURNER: Thank goodness you made it. Any trouble? 
WALTERS: Hundreds of Cybermen about, sir. 
TURNER: Well, the sooner we get out of here, the better. Everybody ready? 
ALL [OC] Yes! 
ISOBEL [OC]: Ready, we're coming. 
WALTERS: Listen! 
(Turner looks outside as an IE jeep screeches to a halt across the road.) 
TURNER: We've had the jeep. We'd better get out of here, out of the back way as quickly as possible. 
WALTERS: Right! 
TURNER: Come on, move, everybody. Quickly! Out of the back door. Hurry it up. Come on Jamie. Professor, all right? Good. 
(Watkins is carrying the R/T. A rifle barrel smashes the glass in the front door and he is shot.) 
WATKINS: My leg! 
(Turner fires two shots then his pistol jams.) 
TURNER: Come on, Jamie. Get the radio out of here. 
JAMIE: Right. 
TURNER: Leave the Professor to me. 
JAMIE: Okay. Have you got him? 
TURNER: Yes. Right, I've got him. 
JAMIE: Right. 
TURNER: Come on. 
(Three more shots come through the front door and Jamie is hit but manages to stagger to the back of the house.)

[Aeroplane]

BRIGADIER: Yes, Jimmy, where are you? 
TURNER [OC]: In bother, sir. We need help. Can you give us a chopper. 
BRIGADIER: Yes. Can you make sector five? 
TURNER [OC]: We can try, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Right, I'll get the chopper there. Out. UNIT Control calling sector five chopper. Over. 
PILOT [OC]: Receiving you. Over. 
BRIGADIER: This is the Brigadier. Are you airborne? 
PILOT [OC]: Yes, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Right. Proceed to sector five and pick up Captain Turner and party, and bring them here. 
PILOT [OC]: Wilco. Out.

[Vaughn's office]

VAUGHN: How could they escape the Cyber-control? 
PACKER: It's that Doctor, something to do with him. You should have got rid of him when you had the chance. 
VAUGHN: Shut up, Packer! I must go on with the invasion. 
PACKER: But what about the Professor? Without him, we can't make any more machines. Without machines we can't control the Cybermen. 
VAUGHN: Let me worry about that. For the moment, I have the Cybermen exactly where I want them. 
PACKER: Yeah, but for how long? Now, can you honestly say that everything's going according to plan, that nothing's been overlooked? Well, can you? 
VAUGHN: Just obey my orders! Now, get in touch with the compound and have the radio beam projected. The invasion fleet must be brought in.

[Aeroplane]

(In flight.) 
WALTERS: New York's off the air, sir. Moscow's dead and Peking. In fact, nothing. No radio communication at all. 
BRIGADIER: Right, Sergeant. Keep trying all frequencies. 
WALTERS: Yes, sir. 
BRIGADIER: It seems to be a total blanket all over the world. 
TURNER: Look, couldn't we make hundreds of these neuristor things, sir, and distribute them. 
BRIGADIER: I doubt there's time for that Jimmy. What do you think, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I agree. The Cybermen will attack in force now. There must be thousands of them in outer space. 
BRIGADIER: Is there nothing we can do? 
DOCTOR: Not unless we can stop the Cyber-control signals. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, but if your theory's right, they'll be coming from somewhere near the moon. That means we're going to need a missile of some sort. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid it does. 
TURNER: That would need an orbital launch vehicle. We simply haven't got anything of that size. 
BRIGADIER: No, only the Americans and the Russians have. Wait a minute. 
(Lethbridge-Stewart gets thick lever binder from a safe.) 
BRIGADIER: I seem to remember reading. Ah, yes, yes, here we are. The Russians were planning a countdown at the time we were attacked. 
TURNER: For the moon, sir? 
BRIGADIER: Yes, a manned orbital survey. That means they'll have a launching vehicle almost ready to go. 
TURNER: You mean we could put a warhead on it, in place of the astronaut capsule? 
BRIGADIER: It's a possibility. 
DOCTOR: How long would all this take? 
BRIGADIER: Well, we could get a small party there in about two hours. Of course, we'll have to revive the rocket personnel from Cyber-control. After that, well, that'd be up to the Russians. 
TURNER: It means it's all a question of time. How long do you think we have, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm surprised they're not here already. 
BRIGADIER: Jimmy, here's the gen on the Russian rocket base. You deal with that. 
TURNER: All right, sir. 
BRIGADIER: And get your skates on. 
TURNER: Yes, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Now, Doctor, we must deal with this invasion you say is coming. 
DOCTOR: Yes, at least we know where they'll land. They'll home in on Vaughn's radio signal. 
BRIGADIER: Would we be able to pick them off with anti-missile missiles? 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a good idea. We might have a try. 
BRIGADIER: Right. There's a base near Henlow Downs. Just a minute. Sergeant Walters? 
(Zoe enters.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, Zoe, sit down. It's a big bumpy. Now, how's Jamie's leg? 
ZOE: Oh, it's just a slight flesh wound. But he's furious because the Army doctor won't let him walk on it. 
DOCTOR: Well, he would be, wouldn't he. How's the Professor? 
ZOE: Oh, he'll be all right, Isobel's with him. Anything I can do, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well I suggest that you go with the Brigadier. Much as I detest computers, I think that remarkable brain of yours will come in very handy. 
ZOE: Right. What are you going to do? 
DOCTOR: I think it's about time I had a serious talk with our Mister Vaughn. 
ZOE: What, go back? But he'd kill you as soon as look at you. 
DOCTOR: No, we need time if we're going to stop this attack, and I think I can get us that time. 
BRIGADIER: No, this is madness, I can't afford to let you take that risk. 
DOCTOR: You can't afford not to, Brigadier. If you're going to attack the Cybermen with missiles, they're going to retaliate, and we want to know how and with what. 
ZOE: But how can you find that out? 
DOCTOR: I'll leave my radio on, and then you'll hear every word that passes between me and Vaughn. 
BRIGADIER: But you'll never get near the place. The whole area will be crawling with Cybermen. 
DOCTOR: Oh, there's one particular place where there'll be no Cybermen. 
BRIGADIER: Where's that? 
DOCTOR: In the sewers. 
WALTERS: We're coming in to land, sir.

[Airfield]

(The Brigadier and Zoe watch as the Doctor drives a Land Rover out of the Hercules.) 
DOCTOR: Bye bye. 
(He drives away. Captain Turner comes down with another one.) 
BRIGADIER: All set, Jimmy? 
TURNER: Yes, sir. I've got a hypersonic jet laid on. We'll be in Russia in no time. 
BRIGADIER: Splendid. 
ZOE: Good luck. 
TURNER: Thank you.

[Aeroplane]

WALTERS: All sections prepare for take-off. Secure loading bay and stand by in flight positions. All UNIT ground section leaders stand by on full alert readiness. 
BRIGADIER: Sergeant Walters, ask Wing Commander Robbins to bring us down at the nearest airstrip to Henlow Downs Defence base. 
WALTERS: Yes, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Oh, and Sergeant, make sure that a chopper stays in Red sector one area. The Doctor might need it in a hurry.

[Sewers]

DOCTOR: (sotto) UNIT control. This is the Doctor. Is the Brigadier there, please? 
WALTERS [OC]: Hold on a moment, sir. I'll get him. 
BRIGADIER [OC]: Yes, Doctor, go ahead. 
DOCTOR: Brigadier, I've just entered the sewers. I'm going to make my way to Vaughn's headquarters. I'll give you a call when I get there. 
BRIGADIER [OC]: Right. We'll have a chopper in the area in case you get in trouble. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
(The Doctor puts the radio in his inside pocket then tosses a coin to decide which way he should go.)

[Aeroplane]

ZOE: But your helicopter isn't going to be much use to the Doctor if he does meet any Cybermen down in those sewers. 
BRIGADIER: If you've got any better suggestions, I'll be pleased to hear them. 
WALTERS: Excuse me, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Yes. 
WALTERS: Captain Turner's airborne. ETA over Russia two hours seven minutes from takeoff. 
BRIGADIER: Good. Keep the Doctor's channel open and let me know the moment he contacts you. 
WALTERS: Yes, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Well, don't look so worried. Fancy a cup of tea?

[Vaughn's office]

PACKER: With particularly heavy concentrations here, here, here, and here. 
VAUGHN: And all the main communication centres are now manned by our forces? 
PACKER: Yes, but, er 
VAUGHN: What? But what, Packer? 
PACKER: Well, we can't make a complete takeover without the full invasion force. 
VAUGHN: They'll arrive, Packer, they'll arrive. And when they do, there won't be one city in the entire world that we don't control. Think of it, Packer, the entire world! 
(An alarm sounds.) 
PACKER: It's the security alarm. The UNIT forces must have 
VAUGHN: Packer! 
(Vaughn goes through the security camera views until - .) 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Oh, there you are. Can you hear me, Mister Vaughn? 
VAUGHN: Yes? 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: I hope I haven't called at an inconvenient moment, but I would rather like a word with you. 
VAUGHN: Clever of you to avoid our Cyber-control beam. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Oh, it was nothing. I'll come up. I know the way. 
(Transmission ends.) 
PACKER: He must be out of his mind. 
VAUGHN: Far from it, Packer. Have the guards search the building, just in case he's brought any friends with him. 
PACKER: Why not just kill him? He's caused enough trouble already. 
VAUGHN: You forget, Packer. He's our insurance.

[Aeroplane]

(Lethbridge-Stewart is strapping on his gun belt.) 
WALTERS: Approaching Henlow airstrip now, sir. Two minutes to touchdown. 
BRIGADIER: Fine. Tell the raiding party to stand by. 
WALTERS: Yes, sir. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Brigadier. Brigadier. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor, go ahead. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Ah. I'm just about to enter the lion's den. I will leave the radio on as from now. 
BRIGADIER: Right. Good luck. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Thank you. 
BRIGADIER: Keep that channel open and get the whole thing on tape. 
WALTERS: Yes, sir. 
BRIGADIER: If he yells for help while I'm away, send in everything we've got to get him out. 
WALTERS: Right. 
VAUGHN [OC]: Ah Doctor, what an unexpected pleasure. Do come in.

[Vaughn's office]

DOCTOR: And you trust them? 
VAUGHN: Doctor, I've worked with the Cybermen for five years preparing this invasion. I know them, the way they think, the single-mindedness of their purpose. 
DOCTOR: Then you must know what ruthless and inhuman killers they are. 
VAUGHN: Of course. But then, they are my allies, not my enemies. 
DOCTOR: Do you really think they'll honour any bargain that you make with them? 
VAUGHN: Oh, I've planned this whole operation in great detail, allowing for every possible factor. It was I who contacted them in deep space, provided the means by which they travelled to Earth, and masterminded the whole operation from A to Z. They have merely provided their advanced scientific skills, their might and strength. 
DOCTOR: What do they get out of all this? 
VAUGHN: What they want, and what they're going to get, are two entirely different things. 
DOCTOR: Oh, you're a fool, Vaughn. When they get here, they'll take over. 
VAUGHN: All Cybermen here are conditioned to obey my orders. They are directly under my command. 
DOCTOR: Oh, possibly. But what about the others, out there in space? Are they conditioned to obey your commands? 
VAUGHN: If they're not, I'll destroy them. 
DOCTOR: With the Professor's machine? 
VAUGHN: Yes. 
DOCTOR: With one machine? 
VAUGHN: I'll have more made. 
DOCTOR: But you'll have to have the Professor's help to do that, won't you? We've got the Professor. 
VAUGHN: They'll be under my command, exactly like the others. 
DOCTOR: But you can't be sure of that, can you?

[Henlow Downs]

(Everyone here is out cold when Lethbridge-Stewart, Zoe and two soldiers enter.) 
BRIGADIER: Get all these men fitted with neuristors, and put the radio over there. 
(Zoe starts on the nearest man). 
BRIGADIER: UNIT Control, UNIT Control, how do you read me? Over. 
WALTERS [OC]: Loud and clear, sir. Over. 
BRIGADIER: Any trouble? 
WALTERS [OC]: No, sir. Captain Turner reports they're over the Russian border now, sir. Over. 
ZOE: How about the Doctor? 
BRIGADIER: Sergeant, how about the Doctor? 
WALTERS [OC]: So far, so good, sir. Over. 
BRIGADIER: Right. Out. 
(The men with new neuristers start to wake.). 
BRIGADIER: Take it easy, Major. 
BRANWELL: What happened? Were we, were we attacked? 
BRIGADIER: Now just try and clear your head. There's a great deal to be done.

[Vaughn's office]

DOCTOR: But you daren't take the risk! Once the Cybermen take over, they'll destroy the Earth as we know it! 
VAUGHN: You're just playing for time, aren't you? 
DOCTOR: I'm trying to stop you from destroying the human race! 
VAUGHN: Your UNIT friends. You presumably managed to protect them from the Cyber-control as well? What are they planning? 
DOCTOR: I don't know what you're talking about. 
VAUGHN: Packer? 
PACKER [on monitor]: Yes, sir. 
VAUGHN: Is the radio beam in the compound aligned yet? 
PACKER [on monitor]: Yes, sir. It's all ready. 
VAUGHN: Good. Then link the beam to the invasion fleet. 
PACKER [on monitor]: Right, Mister Vaughn. 
VAUGHN: Whatever it is your UNIT friends are trying to do, it's too late.

[Henlow Downs]

BRANWELL: But this is fantastic. Unbelievable. 
BRIGADIER: Nevertheless true. We believe they'll be sending their full invasion fleet at any time. If they get here, we've had it. 
BRANWELL: I see, sir. Sergeant Peters? 
PETERS: Sir. 
BRANWELL: Anything on the scope? 
PETERS: Not a glimmer, sir. 
BRANWELL: Well, sir? 
BRIGADIER: I suppose we could be too late. 
ZOE: What's the maximum range of your radar? 
PETERS: Accurate up to fifty thousand miles, miss. Dodgy after that. 
ZOE: Well, that means we're not likely to pick them up until they're almost on top of us. 
BRANWELL: Yes, that's true. Well, let's be prepared in case they do appear on the screens. Sergeant Peters, prepare all launch pads. Begin fuel priming and start preliminary countdown. 
PETERS: Sir. 
(Pads 1-8 go to stand by, with their triple missile complements swinging up and round ready to launch.)

[Vaughn's office]

PLANNER: The transporters will be launched. 
VAUGHN: It's all arranged. 
PLANNER: The invasion fleet will arrive in two parts. 
DOCTOR: You must stop them! This is madness! You can't trust them! 
VAUGHN: Don't you understand yet? I have no alternative. (sotto) I can't see all these years of work destroyed. I must go on, I must!

[Henlow Downs]

WALTERS [OC]: That's what we hear, sir. The rest of them are on their way. Over. 
BRANWELL: Something coming in now, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Anything from Captain Turner? Have they landed in Russia yet? 
WALTERS [OC]: They've landed, sir, but we've heard nothing more. Over. 
BRIGADIER: I see. Out. 
PETERS: Sir, it's just on range limits now, sir. Faint yet, but moving in fast. 
BRIGADIER: Is this it? 
BRANWELL: It looks like it, sir. 
PETERS: More now, sir, look. They're on a ballistic trajectory. 
(A V formation of dots heads towards the middle of the radar screen.) 
ZOE: How long before they'll be within range of your missiles? 
PETERS: At this rate, a couple of minutes at the moment, miss. 
BRANWELL: Sergeant Peters? 
PETERS: Sir! 
BRANWELL: Where are we on countdown? 
PETERS: T minus forty five seconds sir. 
BRANWELL: Hold. 
(Branwell uses the base intercom. The status board has moved from Stand By to Phasing and Readiness.) 
BRANWELL: Launch crew hear this. Forty five seconds to lift off. Prepare fuse locks. 
WOMAN [OC]: Fuse locks in preparation. Arming code running. 
BRANWELL: Run co-ordinates programme A theta. 
PETERS: Sir! 
ZOE: There are more of them! 
PETERS: Sir. 
BRANWELL: Sky range probes active. Yes, what is it. 
PETERS: More of them, sir! 
WOMAN [OC]: Arming code run. All warheads ready for lift off activation. 
BRANWELL: Well, we can't get them all. Let's take as many as we can. Lift off the activation check. 
PETERS: Coordinate programme running sir. 
BRANWELL: Link programme to telemeter guidance. 
PETERS: Roger. 
ZOE: Major, I think we stand a good chance of getting at least ninety percent of them. 
BRANWELL: How? We haven't got enough missiles. 
ZOE: Oh please, Major. Just knocking out half a dozen of them would do very little good at all. Let's try for them all. 
BRANWELL: Look, Miss, I know my business and I'm telling you we haven't got enough missiles. 
ZOE: Yes, you have. These things are coming in in a formation pattern. Now if you set your missiles carefully you can set up a chain reaction of explosions. 
BRANWELL: No. There isn't time to compute all the relevant information. They'd be on top of us by then. 
ZOE: Give me thirty seconds. 
BRIGADIER: Give her what she asks, Major. Thirty seconds. 
BRANWELL: But sir, this is ridiculous! 
BRIGADIER: Just thirty seconds. 
BRANWELL: Hold for thirty seconds! 
PETERS: Sir, that doesn't give us much time. 
BRANWELL: All right Sergeant, I know. Countdown to begin T minus forty five seconds. 
(Zoe grabs a clipboard, takes data from the control panels along the wall and does some sums.) 
ZOE: Here. Feed this into your computer. 
BRANWELL: Do as she says, now. I'll take over here. 
PETERS: Sir. 
BRANWELL: You'd better be right. 
ZOE: I am. 
BRANWELL: T minus forty five seconds from now. 
PETERS: Information computed, sir. Thank you, miss. 
(Zoe lets Peters sit down again.) 
BRANWELL: Align to telemeter guidance. 
PETERS: Sir. T minus thirty two seconds. 
WOMAN [OC]: Launch crew clear, sir. 
PETERS: Automatic. 
BRANWELL: Yes, all guidance now to computer control. Check. 
PETERS: T minus twenty eight seconds T minus twenty two seconds. Eighteen seconds 
BRANWELL: No hold-ups, please. 
PETERS: T minus fourteen seconds. Thirteen, twelve. Ten, nine 
(Branwell inserts the firing keys.) 
PETERS: Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, aero. 
(Branwell presses the launch button and the missile clusters hurtle up into the air, shedding their booster rockets. Once in space, they strike the Cyber-fleet. KaBOOMs all round.)

[Vaughn's office]

PLANNER: The first transporter fleet is being attacked and destroyed. You have betrayed us. 
VAUGHN: No! 
PLANNER: The failure of this mission is due to you. We will now take over the invasion. 
VAUGHN: No! Wait! Give me time! I can stop this opposition! 
PLANNER: There is no more time. 
VAUGHN: I won't allow this invasion to 
(Vaughn steps into the Planner's alcove but is stopped and forced back by an energy wall.) 
PLANNER: We no longer need you. A Cyber-megatron bomb will be delivered. We must destroy life on Earth completely. Every living being. 
DOCTOR: Is this what you wanted? To be the ruler of a dead world?

Episode Eight

[Aeroplane]

VAUGHN [OC]: You can't do that. You can't destroy the world. What about me? 
PLANNER [OC]: You are of no further use to us. The Cyber-invasion must succeed. The bomb will be delivered. 
ISOBEL: Hey, you'd better call 
BENTON: UNIT Control calling the Brigadier. UNIT Control calling the Brigadier. Over.

[Henlow Downs]

BRANWELL: Every single one of them, knocked right out of the sky. 
BRIGADIER: Exactly as you predicted, a chain reaction of explosions. 
BRANWELL: It's fantastic. How do you do it? 
ZOE: Well, it's all quite logical really. Hardly any calculation needed at all. Except for simple stuff like speed, angle of descent and relative positions of the spaceships. 
PETERS: Can't we keep her on, sir? She's much prettier than a computer. 
BENTON [OC]: Calling the Brigadier. 
BRIGADIER: Quiet, everyone! 
BENTON [OC]: UNIT control calling the Brigadier. Over. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, Sergeant, what's the flap? 
BENTON [OC]: Corporal Benton here, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Benton? Well, what's happened to Sergeant Walters? 
BENTON [OC]: He's taken over the Geneva link, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Oh, I see. Well, what's the flap? 
BENTON [OC]: It's news from the Doctor, sir, just come through on his open channel. They're going to drop some sort of bomb. 
BRIGADIER: Bomb? You mean the Cyberman are? 
BENTON [OC]: Yes, sir. Something called a Cyber-megatron bomb. They're going to wipe us all out, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Right, Benton, stand by. We're on our way back. Out. We're moving out. Keep in touch, Major. We'll keep all radio communication on open network so that you'll know what's going on. 
BRANWELL: Right sir. 
BRIGADIER: And keep your eyes skinned in case they start sending any more stuff in. And try and get a fix on that bomb. 
BRANWELL: If we do, sir, we'll try to touch it off on its approach orbit. 
BRIGADIER: Right. Let's go!

[Vaughn's office]

VAUGHN: But if you do, you'll destroy everything here. Even your own Cybermen! 
PLANNER: The sacrifice will be small. 
VAUGHN: You can't do this! I won't let you! 
PLANNER: You cannot stop us. No one can. 
DOCTOR: Now you're beginning to understand the Cybermen, Vaughn, you can't make bargains with them! 
VAUGHN: I won't let them take over. I won't! You think you're indestructible? Well, I can destroy all of you! 
(Vaughn aims Walter's device at the Planner and turns it on.) 
PLANNER: Opposition is useless. The Cybermen will 
DOCTOR: Vaughn! Switch it off, you'll blow us all sky high! 
VAUGHN: I'll destroy them all! All! 
(The Cyber-Planner goes boom!) 
VAUGHN: It's dead. I killed it. I destroyed it. 
DOCTOR: That won't stop them. They're still out there in space preparing to destroy the world. 
VAUGHN: Five years, and in less than five seconds! 
DOCTOR: Vaughn, listen to me. The Cybermen will deliver their bomb on the same radio beam they used for their invasion. You've got to turn it off, man. You've got to turn it off! 
VAUGHN: What? 
DOCTOR: We're both on the same side now, both fighting for our lives. You've got to turn the radio beam off! 
VAUGHN: The radio? 
DOCTOR: Yes! That's how they'll deliver their bomb! 
VAUGHN: The radio beam! Yes, yes, Packer must. Packer! Packer! Where are you? 
(A Cyberman appears on the monitor. Packer enters.) 
PACKER: Vaughn! They've taken over! The Cybermen, they won't obey! They've killed the. They're coming after us. Vaughn, what have you done to us? What have you done? 
(A Cyberman enters. Packer tries shooting it but is killed by the beam from its chest unit. The Doctor pops up from behind Vaughn's desk and turns Walter's device on it. The Cyberman collapses in smoke.) 
DOCTOR: Vaughn, where is the transmitter for the radio beam? 
VAUGHN: We can't fight them. They're too powerful. Too many of them. 
DOCTOR: Oh, don't be a fool, man. Where do we turn it off? 
VAUGHN: At the compound, but they'll be there. 
DOCTOR: Right. We must stop them. Brigadier, Brigadier, this is the Doctor. Can you still hear me.

[Aeroplane]

BRIGADIER: Yes Doctor, we heard everything. What do we do? 
DOCTOR [OC]: There are only two possibilities. We must either cut off the transmitter of the radio beam at the compound or destroy the Cyberman spaceship. 
BRIGADIER: How much time do we have? 
DOCTOR [OC]: Oh, I've no idea, it could be minutes or hours. Depends how long it'll takes them to prepare this bomb of theirs. 
BRIGADIER: Well, destroying the spaceship is going to take time. Now, we've heard from Captain Turner. The Russians are with us, but they say it'll take at least ten hours or more to get a missile that far. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Then there's only one chance. The radio beam. Wait. Vaughn. Now, Vaughn, will you help us? We must try to get to the controls of the radio beam. We'll never do it in time unless you help us!

[Vaughn's office]

VAUGHN: You still think you have a chance? 
DOCTOR: Yes, if you'll help us! 
VAUGHN: Help you? Why should I? 
DOCTOR: Well, to save us. To save yourself! 
VAUGHN: And if I survive, what future have I got? What will the world do with me? 
DOCTOR: Oh, for heaven's sake, stop thinking about yourself! Think of the millions of people on earth who are about to die! 
VAUGHN: Appealing to my better nature? No. If I help you it'll be because I hate them. The Cybermen, my allies. You think I'm mad, that all I want is power for its own sake. No, I have to have power. The world is weak, vulnerable, a mess of uncoordinated and impossible ideals. It needs a strong man, a single mind. A leader! 
DOCTOR: Vaughn, will you listen? 
VAUGHN: Right. I'll help you to destroy them because I hate them. They destroyed my dream. 
BRIGADIER [OC]: Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes, Brigadier? 
BRIGADIER [OC]: We have a chopper in the area. Can you get up to the roof? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, we'll wait there for you. 
BRIGADIER [OC]: Wilco. Out. 
VAUGHN: Your UNIT friends are very efficient. I'll lead the way to the roof. 
(The Doctor picks up Walter's device.) 
VAUGHN: No, no, no, I'll take that. The Cybermen will be guarding the radio transmitter. 
DOCTOR: Oh, dear.

[Aeroplane]

BRIGADIER: Brigadier to Wing Commander. Get us airborne and head for the nearest airstrip to the compound area. Red sector two. 
WING COMMANDER [OC]: Wilco. 
BRIGADIER: Take over, Benton. 
BENTON: Right, sir. 
ISOBEL: Are we going to go in and help the Doctor? 
BRIGADIER: Ah yes. 
ZOE: He'll need it if he's got to fight his way through two hundred Cybermen. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, I only wish we had more time to release more men from the Cyber-control. As it is we've only got a platoon. 
TURNER [OC]: Captain Turner to UNIT Control. Come in Control. Do you read me, over? 
BENTON: Loud and clear. Hang on, sir! 
BRIGADIER: Yes, Jimmy. Over. 
TURNER [OC]: Hello sir. The Russians have fitted a warhead to the rocket now, sir. A super-cooled hydrogen device. It's a solid fuel booster so it's nearly ready for liftoff. Over. 
BRIGADIER: Good, Jimmy, sounds promising. We probably haven't got all that much time, but there's no reason why we shouldn't chuck everything we've got at them. Out. 
WING COMMANDER [OC]: Ready for take off, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Take off.

[Henlow Downs]

BENTON [OC]: All UNIT personnel to flight positions. Standard take off procedure. Assault platoon, prepare for action. ETA, fifteen minutes approximately. All mobile UNIT groups proceed to Red sector two area. I say again, all mobile UNIT groups proceed to Red sector two area. 
PETERS: Do you think that Russian rocket stands any chance? 
BRANWELL: At that distance? Not enough time. 
PETERS: No, I suppose not. 
BRANWELL: That's why those Cybermen things are keeping their range. They know they're safe. 
PETERS: But you never know, they could take time to get that bomb of theirs ready, and that Russian rocket might make it. 
BRANWELL: Yeah, it just might. 
(The rocket and its deadly payload lift off, presumably from Krasnoyarsk or somewhere similar.)

[Aeroplane]

BENTON: Sir, Captain Turner reports Russian missile on it's way. 
BRIGADIER: Wish them luck. Now, Captain Turner will be keeping us posted stage by stage, so keep listening, Benton. 
BENTON: Sir. 
PILOT [OC]: UNIT sector five chopper to Command. Over. 
BENTON: Command here. Receiving you. Over. 
PILOT [OC]: Coming in to land at the compound, Red sector two. My passenger wants a word. Over. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Er, Brigadier. We're just coming in to land at the compound. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, hang on till we get there. We'll give you support. 
DOCTOR [OC]: No, no, I'm sorry, Brigadier. We must go in right away, otherwise we'll be too late. 
BRIGADIER: But that's madness. You don't stand a chance against the Cybermen without us. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Don't worry. We have the Professor's machine. It's proved to be very effective so far. 
BRIGADIER: Well, don't take any chances. We'll get there as soon as we can. Where should we head for? 
DOCTOR: Vaughn says that the transmitter controls are in the old IE factory. That's on the east side of the compound. 
BRIGADIER: Right. 
PILOT: Chopper Pilot to Command, sir. Coming down now. What shall I do, stick around? Over. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, hover above them. It'll give us a bearing. 
PILOT: Wilco. Out. 
BRIGADIER: How long before we touch down, Benton? 
BENTON: About ten minutes, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Right, get the men out as soon as we've taxied in. 
BENTON: Right, sir. Assault platoon prepare for action. Maintain constant communication with control on Red alert frequency. 
ZOE: Can we come with you? 
BRIGADIER: Well I don't really think 
ISOBEL: It'll be the last chance I'll get to photograph the Cybermen. Please. 
BRIGADIER: As long as you keep out of the way. At least I'll be able to keep an eye on you this time.

[Factory grounds]

(The Doctor and Vaughn are making their way to the building. They spot a Cyberman patrolling and Vaughn readies Watkin's device, but the Doctor pulls him back.) 
VAUGHN: What are you doing? We must destroy them! 
DOCTOR: We want to get to the radio transmitter control room. The Cybermen don't know we're here yet. Let's keep that element of surprise. Come on, we'll try down here. 
(This time there is no avoiding another Cyberman, but Vaughn gets it before it can fire its weapon.) 
DOCTOR: Now they know we're here. 
VAUGHN: Right. Up there. We'll go over the roofs. 
(They run up the fire escape and look down on an area where several Cybermen are standing.) 
VAUGHN: That's it. That's where we've got to get to. Down there.

[Factory entrance]

(UNIT and 2nd Battalion Coldsteam Guards arrive.) 
BRIGADIER: There's the chopper. The Doctor's over that way. Follow me! 
SOLDIER: Yes, sir.

[Factory rooftop]

DOCTOR: Look out! 
(Another Cyberman gets treated to a blast of strong emotions. It tumbles over the edge of the roof and lands with a clang.) 
DOCTOR: Look out! Come on! 
(A group of four Cybermen are coming their way.) 
DOCTOR: Is this the only way down? 
VAUGHN: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Come on, then. 
(The Doctor and Vaughn go down another ladder.)

[Factory compound]

BRIGADIER: Cybermen! Take cover! 
(The army engage the enemy.) 
BRIGADIER: Grenades! 
(The explosions take out some Cybermen, but the rest keep coming, killing the soldiers.) 
BRIGADIER: Bazooka! 
(That is effective too. The Doctor and Vaughn can hear the gunfire.) 
BRIGADIER: If they come around, move. 
(More grenades and bazooka fire.) 
BRIGADIER: Stop! Forward! 
(Zoe and Isobel accompany the Brigadier as he views the remains of the enemy.) 
BRIGADIER: And that was just a dozen of them. I'd hate to have to meet a hundred of them. Forward! 
SOLDIER: Forward! 
(Isobel takes some souvenir pictures. The Doctor and Vaughn come to a building with a small door.) 
VAUGHN: That's where the main control switch is for the radio beam. 
DOCTOR: There don't seem to be any Cybermen about at all. That's odd. 
VAUGHN: Well let's not waste time, then. 
(Vaughn goes up to the small door, as three of Cybermen come out of a nearby building.) 
DOCTOR: Look behind you! 
(Vaughn uses the device and takes out two of them, but the third one fires his weapon and kills him. The Doctor runs, dodging explosions from the cyber-weapon. The army arrive.) 
BRIGADIER: Doctor, get down! 
(The Doctor obeys instantly.) 
BRIGADIER: Right, bazooka! 
(The Cyberman is killed.) 
BRIGADIER: You all right, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: What? Yes, yes, it's there, in that building. The radio transmitter control, you've got to destroy it! 
BRIGADIER: Leave it to us. Forward! 
ISOBEL: Just a second. 
(Isobel takes photographs of the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, but I 
(As the soldiers run past, the Doctor tries to tidy himself up for the camera.) 
ISOBEL: That's it. That's better. Sit still.

[Aeroplane]

BRIGADIER: And for the moment, the crisis is over. The radio transmitter's been destroyed, so the Cybermen can no longer deliver their bomb. But their spaceship is still sending out its hypnotic signals. The world is still paralysed.

[Henlow Downs]

BRIGADIER [OC]: To stop these signals, we have to destroy the Cyberman spaceship. 
PETERS: Sir! 
BRIGADIER [OC]: The Russians have already launched a missile which should arrive on target in approximately six hours from now. 
BRANWELL: What is it, Sergeant? 
PETERS: Something on the screen, moving in fast. 
BRIGADIER [OC]: If this is successful, 
PETERS: Look at the size of it! 
BRIGADIER [OC]: Then the world will be released from the Cyber-control, and we can mobilise our forces to fight the Cybermen 
BRANWELL: That can only be one thing. The spaceship. 
BRIGADIER [OC]: Remaining on earth. In this case, I'd like all units 
BRANWELL: Hello, UNIT Control. Hello, UNIT Control. Henlow Downs calling UNIT control. Over. 
BRIGADIER [OC]: Yes, Major. 
BRANWELL: Sorry to interrupt you sir, but we've picked up a large UFO approaching Earth.

[Aeroplane]

BRANWELL [OC]: It's standing off at about fifty thousand miles. Outside our range, I'm afraid. Over. 
ZOE: They've moved in. Why? 
BRIGADIER: Thank you, Major. Out. Get Captain Turner. 
BENTON: Right, sir. UNIT Control calling Captain Turner. UNIT Control calling Captain Turner. Do you read me? 
BRIGADIER: Why do you think they've moved their spaceship in so close, Doctor? 
BENTON: UNIT Control calling Captain Turner. UNIT Control calling Captain Turner. Do you read me? 
DOCTOR: I'm not sure. Possibly to try to avoid the Russian missile or 
BRIGADIER: Or to deliver their bomb by other means. 
BENTON: UNIT Control calling Captain Turner. UNIT control Calling Captain Turner. Do you read me? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid so. You see, from where they were, let's say two hundred and thirty thousand miles out in space, their conventional missiles couldn't deliver the bomb, so they had to come in close.
ZOE: But in moving in fifty thousand miles, they've come into range of the Russian missiles. Well, it can't be more than a few miles from them. 
DOCTOR: But it's going in the opposite direction! 
TURNER [OC]: Captain Turner here. Over. 
BENTON: Here we are, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, Jimmy. 
TURNER [OC]: Sir. Sorry about the delay but we've had a bit of a flap on here. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, we know. Can the Russians turn their missile? 
TURNER [OC]: Yes, sir. 
BRIGADIER: How long before it strikes? 
TURNER [OC]: They estimate twelve point five minutes, sir. 
BRIGADIER: Thank you, Jimmy. Out. That's more than time enough for them to deliver their bomb and move out to safety, isn't it? 
DOCTOR: Yes, Brigadier, I'm afraid it is. 
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, this is going to be a long twelve minutes. 
(The clock moves from two twenty to two twenty six. The only sound is Benton knocking over his tea mug.) 
BENTON: Sorry, sir.

[Henlow Downs]

PETERS: There it is. The Russian missile. 
BRANWELL: Thank heavens for that. I'll tell UNIT control. 
PETERS: Ah! Must be the Cybermen's bomb. 
BRANWELL: Red alert procedure! Raise all missiles!

[Aeroplane]

BRANWELL [OC]: It'll be in range in about thirty seconds, sir. It's travelling fast but we stand a good chance of picking it off. Over. 
BRIGADIER: How about the Cyber-spaceship, is that still there? 
BRANWELL [OC]: Still there, sir. If they don't shift soon that Russian missile will hit it right on the button. 
BRIGADIER: Let's hope so.

[Henlow Downs]

PETERS: Coming into range sir. 
BRANWELL: Must go, sir. Over and out. 
PETERS: Fifteen seconds. 
BRANWELL: Right. Let's get it first time, lads! 
PETERS: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six 
(Branwell arms the system.) 
PETERS: Five, four, three, two, one, zero! 
(A missile zooms away.) 
PETERS: She's going wide! 
BRANWELL: Prepare two! 
PETERS: Two away, and it looks good. 
BRANWELL: Splendid! Stand by three, just in case. 
PETERS: Standing by. 
PETERS: Ten seconds and it's on the button! It's on the button! We've done it! 
BRANWELL: Hello, UNIT Control. Hello, UNIT Control. Henlow Downs calling UNIT Control. Over. 
PETERS: Sir, the Russian missile, it's almost on top of the spaceship! I think they've got her! 
(KaBOOM!)

[Lounge]

(Back at the house Professor Walters is renting from Professor Travers - another photographic session is underway.) 
ISOBEL: Tired? 
ZOE: No, exhausted! 
ISOBEL: Okay, you can take a breather. 
ZOE: Thanks. 
ISOBEL: Thank goodness I don't have to do any more modelling for a living. 
ZOE: What is this new job of yours, then? 
ISOBEL: Well, because of my photographs of the Cybermen in action, I've got an exclusive contract with a publishing group. So I'll be travelling all over the world, snapping away with my little black box. What will you do now? 
ZOE: Oh, when the Doctor's finished making his circuits, we'll be off again, I suppose. 
ISOBEL: Where to? 
ZOE: Well, we're never really sure. 
(Turner enters.) 
TURNER: Hello. 
ISOBEL: Ah! Here comes my dolly soldier. 
TURNER: Cheeky. Zoe, the Doctor says he's almost ready to leave. I've got the Jeep outside. 
ZOE: Oh fine. But what about Jamie? 
TURNER: Oh, he's all right. He's just having a check-up at the hospital. We'll pick him up on the way. 
ISOBEL: Well, can I come with you? 
TURNER: As long as you promise not to call me your dolly soldier in front of the Brigadier, yes. Come on. 
ZOE: Right, come on!

[Field]

(Turner drives Isobel, the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe back to where they parked the invisible Tardis.) 
ISOBEL: Here? 
DOCTOR: Yes. This is fine, thank you. 
TURNER: A field? There's nothing here. 
ZOE: Are you sure this is the place, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Well I'm very much obliged to you, Captain. 
TURNER: Oh, goodbye. 
DOCTOR: Goodbye to you. Goodbye, Isobel. Goodbye, everyone. Come along, Jamie. 
(They all exchange farewells and the Doctor, Zoe and Jamie go through the gate into the field proper.) 
ISOBEL: Why are they going into that field? 
TURNER: I've no idea. 
DOCTOR: Now, then, where exactly did we leave it? You two try over there. 
(The travellers spread their arms wide in a game of reverse blind-man's bluff to find the Tardis.) 
ISOBEL: What's he doing? 
TURNER: Search me. 
(The Doctor scratches his head and discovers that his elbow has disappeared. The invisibility field obviously extends a couple of inches beyond the Tardis exterior. He unlocks it and goes inside. The engine starts up and the Tardis appears. The Doctor steps outside.) 
DOCTOR: There we are, all done and ready to go. Bye bye. Bye! 
ZOE: Bye. 
JAMIE: Bye. 
ISOBEL: A police box? I don't believe it. 
(Jamie, Zoe and the Doctor enter the Tardis, and it dematerialises.)

[Learning Hall]

(A man in hi-tech clothing removes a tablet from a hole in the wall and makes an announcement.) 
SELRIS: Class three one nine six in the first grade. The names of the first selected candidates are, male, Abu-Gond! The second name is female. Vana-Gond! 
THARA: (a young man) No! 
SELRIS: Abu-Gond and Vana-Gond, alone of your generation you have been chosen to receive the highest honour that can befall a Gond. You are now the companions of the Krotons! Our warmest, our most sincere congratulations to you both. You will now step forward for the investiture of your robes of honour. Eelek. 
(Eelek, played by Philip Madoc, places a silver cape on Abu's shoulder.) 
VANA: Please, Thara! 
THARA: You can't go. I won't let you go! 
VANA: I must! 
THARA: Look, Vana, we can run away. There's still time. 
VANA: You know that's not possible. We must always obey. 
THARA: Why? 
SELRIS: Because, my son, it is the law of the Krotons! 
(A hexagonal door in the wall opens, and Abu walks through, proudly.)

[Planet surface]

(The Tardis materialises at the base of a cliff. The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie look around at the bleak landscape.) 
DOCTOR: Lovely, lovely, lovely. 
JAMIE: Pwoar, bad eggs. Let's try somewhere else. 
ZOE: No, wait a minute. Where are we? 
JAMIE: You don't expect him to know, do you? 
DOCTOR: Well, let's explore shall we? 
(The Doctor puts up an umbrella.) 
JAMIE: An umbrella? 
DOCTOR: Yes, twin suns. It's bound to be hot. 
JAMIE: Oh. 
ZOE: I don't think I like it here. It looks dead. 
JAMIE: Aye, it smells dead. 
ZOE: Sulphur, isn't it? It could be poisonous. 
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, the instruments in the Tardis would have told us. No it's a, it's a mixture of ozone and sulphur. Very bracing!

[Cliff path]

(They clamber up the side of the cliff. The Doctor picks up a flat rock.) 
JAMIE: What's that? 
DOCTOR: Oh, fascinating structures. Magnesium silicate. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
ZOE: He means mica. 
JAMIE: Oh. What? (They reach the top.) 
DOCTOR: Dead, is it? 
(They look down on an alien town of large buildings made of triangles.) 
ZOE: Is it a city? 
DOCTOR: Yes, fascinating architecture. It's more typical of a low gravity planet, and yet I think this is quite normal. Yes. 
ZOE: Inca, perhaps? 
DOCTOR: Yes, possibly. 
JAMIE [OC]: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Come on, let's see what he's up to. Be careful. 
(Jamie is making his way down a scree slope.) 
JAMIE: Doctor, down here. 
JAMIE: Doctor, down here!

[Outside the Dynatrope]

(Jamie has led them to a large metal structure in another cliff face with a hexagonal door and ramp leading up to it.) 
ZOE: What is it? 
JAMIE: I don't know. There's a ramp here. 
ZOE: Yes, and there's a door as well. Is it a wall? 
DOCTOR: I hardly think so, Zoe. 
JAMIE: Phwoar, that smell's a lot stronger round here. 
DOCTOR: Oh this is interesting! 
ZOE: What, Doctor? 
JAMIE: Oh, metal, isn't it? 
ZOE: What, covered in moss and lichen? 
JAMIE: Well, er. 
DOCTOR: Metal? Would you say so? I think we'd better get away from here. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: Come along. 
ZOE: But why? 
DOCTOR: Well, this isn't a building, this is a machine. Come along. 
JAMIE: Machine? Doctor, it's opening! 
DOCTOR: Come on, quickly. Behind the rocks. (The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe hide behind a convenient boulder and watch Abu totter out, somewhat dazed but still wearing his cape. Two nozzles emerge from either side of the door.) 
JAMIE: What's the matter with him? 
DOCTOR: Shush! 
(Abu is enveloped in opaque gas. He collapses, groaning. When the gas clears, all that is left is his metal breastplate and its curled wire necklace.) 
ZOE: Oh, that poor man. 
JAMIE: What happened to him? 
DOCTOR: I don't know, Jamie. Come on, let's get away from here.

[Learning Hall]

THARA: Can't you give the order she doesn't have to go? You're our leader! 
SELRIS: But the Krotons have chosen Vana. It is a great honour! 
THARA: Honour? Why do we take their orders? 
EELEK: Vana. 
THARA: We don't even know if they exist. 
VANA: Thara, you can't say things like that. 
EELEK: Get out of the way. 
THARA: She's not going into that machine! 
EELEK: She has to go in. No one defies the Krotons. 
THARA: All right! 
(Thara draws a small metal hand weapon, a metal axe.) 
EELEK: Now don't be so stupid! 
SELRIS: Thara! 
EELEK: Disarm him! 
(Thara pulls Vana behind him.) 
THARA: Keep back! 
(Meanwhile the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe are coming down a stone staircase.) 
ZOE: Oh, I hope they're friendly. 
DOCTOR: Now just leave this to me, Zoe. 
(The Doctor steps down into the hall.) 
DOCTOR: We are friends! 
(Wicked looking spears are pointed at his throat.) 
DOCTOR: It's all right. Now don't be afraid. 
JAMIE: We have trouble. 
AXUS: Who are you? 
DOCTOR: But, but, one of your people has been 
AXUS: You're strangers. Where are you from? 
ZOE: Well, if we told you it wouldn't mean anything. 
AXUS: Answer me. Where are you from? 
DOCTOR: There's no time for explanations! As I say, one of your people has been 
AXUS: They're not Gonds! Their clothes, the way they're dressed. 
DOCTOR: Look, we are friendly. 
JAMIE: Look, are you going to let us pass or not? 
ZOE: Doctor! Look. 
EELEK: Do something about him. He's your son. 
THARA: I'm warning you. One step nearer. 
SELRIS: Thara, will you be reasonable? The Krotons have sent for Vana. 
THARA: She'd not going. Nobody comes back from there! 
VANA: Let me go, Thara. Please. I don't want them to hurt you. (With a spear point at his throat, Thara throws down his weapon. Vana steps forward to Eelek, who puts a curly necklace with a breastplate attached around Vana's neck.) 
EELEK: A bit of sense, just in time. 
ZOE: That doorway. It's like the other one. 
JAMIE: Aye, and she's wearing a cloak just like that chap we saw killed. 
ZOE: Is she being sacrificed? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so, Zoe. They're too civilised for that. 
JAMIE: Can we not stop them? 
DOCTOR: Well, we can try. Just a minute. Wait! 
AXUS: They're interrupting the ceremony! Take them! 
JAMIE: Now just. (guards grab them) Aye, you wouldn't be so tough without these guards round you. 
AXUS: Get back. I accept your challenge. 
JAMIE: Oh you do, do you? Aye, well, that's just fine with me then. 
DOCTOR: Now Jamie, don't be so rash. 
JAMIE: Ah don't worry, Doctor. I'll see to this laddie. 
(A guard offers Jamie an axe.) 
JAMIE: No, I'll not be needing that, thank you. 
ZOE: Oh, Jamie, watch out! 
(Axus swings his axe and Jamie dodges easily.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
(Axus grabs Jamie's arm and they come in close for a trial of strength.) 
ZOE: Oh Doctor! Oh, can't we stop them? Oh, Jamie. 
(The axe moves closes to Jamie's head.) 
ZOE: Oh Jamie, come on! 
(Jamie forces Axus' arm back over his shoulder and he drops the axe before falling to the floor clutching his wrist. Jamie rejoins the Doctor and Zoe.) 
ZOE: Doctor, look. The girl! 
(Vana looks back at Thara then walks through the doorway.) 
SELRIS: What is happening? Who are these people? 
DOCTOR: That was the very question I was going to ask you! What is happening here? Where has that girl gone? 
AXUS: Eelek, they forced their way through! 
SELRIS: Who are you? 
DOCTOR: There is no time to explain! 
JAMIE: Look, you wouldn't believe us even if we told you. 
ZOE: We're from another planet, another world. 
DOCTOR: That girl. Now where has she gone? 
SELRIS: How can they be from another planet? 
JAMIE: Och, look, we're just wasting time. Now where has she gone? 
DOCTOR: What's behind that wall? 
THARA: The Krotons. They've sent her to join the Krotons. 
ZOE: Well, what are the Krotons? 
THARA: The Krotons live in the machine, so we're told. 
SELRIS: Vana is joining the Krotons. It is a great honour. 
THARA: Honour? She didn't want to go. Nobody really wants to disappear into that thing. 
(The Doctor takes a closer look at the door.) 
DOCTOR: How do you open this door? 
EELEK: Why are you asking so many questions? 
DOCTOR: Because a moment ago we saw a young man dressed in a silver robe just like that girl. We saw him killed! 
SELRIS: Abu-Gond? 
EELEK: That's ridiculous. How can these people have seen Abu-Gond? 
SELRIS: He's with the Krotons. 
JAMIE: Aye, well, we saw someone killed anyway. He came out of that machine and was 
ZOE: Vapourised. 
JAMIE: Aye. Right round the other side. 
AXUS: Other side? 
SELRIS: You have been in the wasteland. 
EELEK: They're contaminated. You're contaminated. No one goes into the wasteland. 
ZOE: Why not? 
EELEK: Because it's poisoned, and you will die. 
DOCTOR: Well, it may have been poisoned once, but I can assure you it's quite safe now. 
JAMIE: Doctor, that girl. If she comes out that way. 
DOCTOR: Oh Jamie, you're right. We must save her! 
JAMIE: I know! 
DOCTOR: Well, come on! 
JAMIE: That's what I'm saying! 
SELRIS: Where are you going? 
ZOE: To the wasteland! 
(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe run out.) 
SELRIS: But you can't. It's against the law of the Krotons! 
THARA: I'm going with them! 
SELRIS: Thara, come back! 
THARA: If they can go into the wasteland, I can. 
SELRIS: Thara! You'll die!

[Outside the Dynatrope]

JAMIE: There it is. 
DOCTOR: I wonder how long. I imagine we haven't much time. 
ZOE: What are you going to do? 
(The Doctor picks up a piece of mica.) 
DOCTOR: You keep away, Zoe. Keep right away. 
THARA: Can I help? 
DOCTOR: Well, Mister? 
THARA: Thara. 
DOCTOR: Yes, well you can find some more stones like this. 
THARA: What? 
DOCTOR: Well, if you want to help! Now then. 
(The Doctor uses his umbrella to force the stone into the right hand nozzle.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, that one. 
(The Doctor takes a stone from Thara and forces it into the other nozzle.) 
DOCTOR: Right! Come down here. 
(The group hides. The door opens.) 
ZOE: Doctor, I think I can hear something. 
DOCTOR: Yes Zoe, so can I. 
(Vana stumbles out of the doorway.) 
THARA: Vana! 
JAMIE: Keep down! 
(The Doctor runs forward to catch Vana, with his open umbrella shielding them from the door nozzles.) 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, quick! 
JAMIE: Doctor, look out! 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, hurry! 
JAMIE: Quick! 
(The Doctor carries Vana to their hiding place. The stones are finally pushed from the nozzles and the deadly gas is expelled onto empty air.) 
THARA: What's happened? What have they done to her? 
(Some of the gas has caught the umbrella, and ruined it.) 
DOCTOR: The vandals. Look at that. 
ZOE: That could have happened to you! 
DOCTOR: My favourite umbrella. 
THARA: She doesn't know me. She can't speak or anything. 
JAMIE: Aye, it's something that those Krotons have done to her. 
DOCTOR: Let me see. Oh dear, this is almost catatonic. ZOE: Isn't there anything you can do? 
DOCTOR: I'm not a Doctor of medicine you know, Zoe. However, if there's no damage to the tissue. Is there anywhere we can take her? 
THARA: My father's house is quite near, on the edge of the community. 
DOCTOR: Well, let's take her there. Give me a hand. Come on, Jamie.

[Selris' house]

(A simple wattle and daub place with a curtain for a door. Selris gives Zoe a clay beaker and she takes a small sip.) 
SELRIS: It's almost impossible to believe. The Krotons have always been our good friends. Our benefactors. 
ZOE: Well, you've only got to see what they've done to Vana. 
SELRIS: Yes, poor child. 
JAMIE: How is she? 
THARA: Just the same. 
(Thara leaves.) 
(The Doctor is swinging his pocket watch in front of Vana's eyes.) 
DOCTOR: You're resting. You're calmly resting. Your mind is quite empty. You're resting. Now, you're going to sleep, Vana. Sleep. Feeling sleepy. Very sleepy. Sleep. 
(Vana's eyes close.) 
SELRIS: You see, every so often the two best of our students have entered the machine to join the Krotons. They can't all have been murdered. 
ZOE: Well, it's possible. If they had you wouldn't know because this spray stuff just 
JAMIE: Dissolves everything. In any case, none of your people ever go into the wasteland. 
SELRIS: But why should they do it? Why should they kill the best of our students? 
ZOE: What are they like, these Krotons? 
SELRIS: No living person has ever seen them. They never come out of the machine. 
ZOE: Never? 
SELRIS: Not since the beginning. Not for thousands of years. 
ZOE: How is she? 
DOCTOR: She's asleep at last. 
JAMIE: Is she going to be all right, though? 
DOCTOR: Well, I hope so, Jamie. It's difficult to tell. 
(Selris hands the Doctor a beaker.) 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
SELRIS: And she was one of the finest students we've ever produced. 
DOCTOR: Oh really? Competition for you, Zoe. 
ZOE: Selris was just saying that no one's ever seen these Krotons. 
JAMIE: Aye, they never leave that machine. 
DOCTOR: How did all this begin, Selris? 
SELRIS: According to our legends, silver men came out of the sky and built a house among us. The Gonds attacked them but the silver men caused a poisonous rain to fall, killing hundreds of our people and turning the earth black. 
JAMIE: The wasteland. 
SELRIS: Yes. Because it was said that ever afterwards anyone who set foot there would die in terrible pain.

[Learning Hall]

(A balding man with a torch comes down to check the learning machines. He is grabbed by four young men.) 
CUSTODIAN: Who are you? What do you want? Leave me alone! 
THARA: The Krotons. You must know a lot about them. 
CUSTODIAN: What do you mean? 
STUDENT: You're their servant, aren't you? You work for them. 
CUSTODIAN: I am only the Custodian of the Learning Hall. 
THARA: Of course. So you can tell us what we want to know. 
CUSTODIAN: I am forbidden to discuss the secrets. 
STUDENT: We only want to know how to get at them. 
THARA: We want to see the Krotons for ourselves. 
CUSTODIAN: Nobody has seen the Krotons, not for thousands of years. 
THARA: You're sure they don't come out of the machine in the darkness when there's no one here? 
CUSTODIAN: No. Come out? Never! 
THARA: Then how do they give their orders? Answer me! 
CUSTODIAN: There are messages. You must know that. 
THARA: What else? 
CUSTODIAN: Sometimes there is a voice. 
THARA: But you've never seen them? There's no way you can get inside there? 
CUSTODIAN: Only the companions of the Krotons may enter. 
THARA: And now we know what happens to them. But you can summon the Krotons, can't you? 
CUSTODIAN: It is not for me to summon them. I obey their commands. 
THARA: If we can't get in there, then we must fetch them out. Their precious teaching machines. Smash them! 
CUSTODIAN: Smash the machines? Guards! 
(The boys put their hands over his mouth, and the Student threatens with his axe.) 
THARA: Do not hurt him! Tie his hands and gag him. 
STUDENT: Well, keep still then. We've no quarrel with you.

[Selris' house]

JAMIE: But what happened after this war with the Krotons? 
SELRIS: Ever since, we have lived in peace with them. The Krotons never show themselves to us, but we learn from them through the teaching machines. 
ZOE: Teaching machines? 
SELRIS: Yes, in the Hall of Learning, where you were today. The machines fill the mind with knowledge. 
DOCTOR: And everyone uses these machines? 
SELRIS: When they are young, yes. That is the law. 
DOCTOR: Whose law, Selris? 
SELRIS: Our law. The Gonds'. 
DOCTOR: But I thought you said all your laws were given you by the Krotons? 
SELRIS: Yes, all our science, all our culture, everything we have, has come from the machine. 
DOCTOR: I see. A sort of self-perpetuating slavery. And the Krotons always choose your two most promising students? 
SELRIS: To be their companions, yes. Do you think they've all been killed? 
JAMIE: Aye, well, we saw one of them killed anyway. 
ZOE: Well why are they doing it, Doctor? What's the point? 
DOCTOR: Hmm? Well, it's time it was stopped, anyway. It's high time it was stopped. 
SELRIS: What shall I tell my people? How can I explain? 
JAMIE: Explain what? Just tell the truth. 
SELRIS: What, that they've been tricked? That for thousands of years the best of our students have been dying, murdered by the Krotons? 
ZOE: Well, what are you afraid of? 
DOCTOR: Another war between your people and the Krotons, you mean. 
SELRIS: Yes. There could be terrible bloodshed. Another wasteland here in our community. 
(A man enters.) 
BETA: Selris. 
SELRIS: Ah, Beta. Come and meet our guests. My friends, this is Beta, our controller of Science and my son's good friend. 
BETA: That's what I'm here for. Do you know what Thara's planning? 
SELRIS: Planning? 
BETA: He and some students gone out to the Learning Hall. They're going to wreck the machines. 
SELRIS: No! 
BETA: You've got to stop them, Selris. I came as quickly as I could, but they'll be there by now. 
SELRIS: Then it's too late! 
DOCTOR: Not if we cut through the wasteland. 
JAMIE: Aye, it's the shortest route. 
SELRIS: The wasteland? 
BETA: But the poison? 
DOCTOR: Oh, that wore off a long time ago. It's quite safe now. 
JAMIE: Oh well, look, we've been in it twice today and we're all right. 
SELRIS: Very well.

[Learning Hall]

(Thara strikes the first blow with his axe.) 
THARA: Come on! 
(The other boys join in the destruction. Somewhere a machine comes to a conclusion and an X appears on a monitor. An alarm sounds and X comes up on other screens.) 
THARA: There! That should fetch them out! 
STUDENT: Come on, let's wreck another! 
THARA: Smash them! 
COMPUTER [OC]: Stop! This is a warning. Leave the hall. All Gonds leave the hall now. 
STUDENT: It's the Krotons! 
COMPUTER [OC]: Leave the hall. All Gonds leave the hall now. 
THARA: That's just a voice. Listen. 
COMPUTER [OC]: This is a warning. 
THARA: Come out, you Krotons, and fight! Come out! 
STUDENT: Murderers! 
(The boys start hitting another machine as Jamie and Selris run in followed by the Doctor, Beta, Jamie and Zoe.) 
SELRIS: Stop! 
THARA: Leave me alone! 
SELRIS: What are you doing? 
(Selris pulls Thara off the machine.) 
DOCTOR: Stop it. Stop it, all of you! Listen to me. This will do no good at all. These Krotons must have enormous scientific powers. You can't defeat them with axes! 
(The Doctor is being watched on a monitor. A metal pole with a box on top moves across to another monitor where a pixilated image of the Doctor appears.) 
DOCTOR: Now, if this was an atomic laser, it might be more use. 
THARA: An atomic-laser? Is that better than an axe? 
SELRIS: Look at the damage you've done. Completely senseless. 
THARA: Look what they did to our friends, Father. 
SELRIS: Destroying the machines won't avenge Abu, or help Vana, will it? 
STUDENT: But we can't get in there! If we attack their machines 
THARA: The Krotons will come out. 
DOCTOR: I think something's coming out now. 
(A small round hatch opens to the left of the door and a light on a long flexible neck pokes out like a metallic snake.) 
ZOE: What is it? 
DOCTOR: I don't know, Zoe, but keep well clear of it. 
(Blinking, the thing stretches out further into the hall.) 
JAMIE: Look out! 
THARA: What's it doing? 
ZOE: It seems to be looking at us. 
JAMIE: How can it be? It's not alive, is it? 
(The box on a pole turns to show us the picture of the Doctor on its screen.) 
ZOE: Doctor, it's after you. 
(The Doctor backs away, falling over debris, as the probe gets in very close to his face.)

Episode Two

[Learning Hall]

(The Doctor puts his hands up in front of his face, and the probe starts to swing around, searching. He crawls away, keeping his back to it.) 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, don't move! 
DOCTOR: It's all right, Zoe. I think it's quite safe now. 
JAMIE: Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. 
DOCTOR: Just watch this, Jamie. 
(The Doctor walks towards the probe, still holding his hands out in front of his face. Suddenly he drops them, and the probe swings towards him, then he raises them again and it resumes its search.) 
ZOE: Pattern recognition. 
DOCTOR: Yes, and the pattern is my face. 
SELRIS: Doctor, do you mean that thing was sent out to attack you and only you? 
DOCTOR: Yes, so it seems. It's rather flattering, isn't it. 
ZOE: Well then, the Krotons know who you are. 
JAMIE: Aye! 
ZOE: Or at least what you look like. 
DOCTOR: Yes. That means they must have a scanner in the wall of the machine. Now if we can find that, we might be able to get in touch with them. 
JAMIE: Doctor! 
(The Doctor has lowered his hands to talk to his companions and the probe is about to strike. Everyone scatters. A student tries to sneak up behind the probe with an axe, and gets a dose of the disintegrating gas for his efforts. An ashy outline and his axe are all that remains.) 
JAMIE: Oh, no. 
(The computer removes the Doctor's image from its screen and the probe retreats back through its hole in the wall.) 
JAMIE: It's gone back. 
DOCTOR: Yes. That poor fellow must have confused it's attack mechanism. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
DOCTOR: Well, it was programmed to kill once. Me! It must think that it's succeeded, stupid machine. 
THARA: There's your wonderful Krotons for you Father! Murderers! 
(Thara throws the student's axe at the door.) 
SELRIS: No! Thara, don't provoke them! 
THARA: Is that all you care about, not provoking them? 
SELRIS: What can we do against their weapons? 
THARA: We can fight! 
COMPUTER [OC]: This is a warning. Your leader has been destroyed. All Gonds leave the Learning Hall at once. At once. 
THARA: No! Stay and fight! 
COMPUTER [OC]: Leave the Learning Hall. All Gonds leave the learning hall. 
SELRIS: Everyone, leave the hall. Now!

[Selris' house]  

(Vana is lying with her eyes open as the Doctor examines her with a bright light.) 
ZOE: Where did this come from? 
DOCTOR: I borrowed it from Beta. 
ZOE: But I thought they didn't know anything about electricity? 
DOCTOR: They don't. That works on stored solar energy. Yes, the Gonds are quite advanced in some ways. Their medicine's very good, but they haven't got much general chemistry. I wish they had an ETC machine though. 
ZOE: Yes. There are tremendous gaps in their knowledge. Well, they only seem to know what the machines teach them. 
DOCTOR: Yes. And the machines are programmed by the Krotons, so the gaps in their knowledge may be significant. Ah, Selris. 
SELRIS: How is she, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well I think she's better. It's difficult to tell. Selris, is it safe to enter the Learning Hall yet? 
SELRIS: Why? 
DOCTOR: Zoe and I want to have a look round, don't we, Zoe? 
ZOE: Oh, do we? 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. Jamie, hold out your hand, will you? 
JAMIE: What for? 
DOCTOR: These pills I got from Beta. 
JAMIE: There's nothing wrong with me. 
DOCTOR: No, no. They're for Vana. I want you to stay and look after her. 
JAMIE: Oh, now why can't I go with you? 
DOCTOR: Because I particularly want you to give her those pills the moment she wakes up. 
JAMIE: Ah, well. 
ZOE: Well, why are we going back to the Learning Hall? 
DOCTOR: To learn, Zoe. Why else? 
SELRIS: I'm coming with you, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear fellow, there's no need for that. 
SELRIS: I must know what is happening. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, certainly. Come along, Zoe. 
(The Doctor and Selris leave.) 
JAMIE: Zoe, watch him. You know what he's like. 
ZOE: Oh don't worry, Jamie. I'll make sure he doesn't do anything rash.

[Learning Hall]

(Selris sends a squad of guards armed with pikes up the steps.) 
DOCTOR: Selris, what's that? 
(A trap door in the floor at the bottom of the stairs.) 
SELRIS: Oh, that leads to the under-hall. 
DOCTOR: Oh? What's down there? 
SELRIS: Nothing. It's never used. 
DOCTOR: I wonder how far underneath? Let's have a look, shall we? 
(The Doctor opens the trap door and starts down the steps.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, it's a bit dark and musty down here. Zoe, stay up there, will you? We shan't be long. 
(Selris follows the Doctor down. Zoe sits herself down at a learning console and puts on the headset. She presses some buttons and a pattern comes up on the monitor in front of her. It resolves itself into series of equations. Her activity alerts the computer. The Doctor and Selris climb back out of the trap door.) 
SELRIS: I told you there was nothing down there. 
DOCTOR: Ah, but there was, Selris. Something rather curious. 
SELRIS: Only the foundations of the machine. It stands on those metal pillars. 
DOCTOR: Zoe! 
(The Doctor takes the headset off Zoe.) 
DOCTOR: Zoe! 
ZOE: Oh, you're soon back, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: What do you think you're doing? 
ZOE: I was just trying the machine. 
DOCTOR: You should know better than to do a thing like that. 
ZOE: Oh, but Doctor, it was all so easy! The Krotons were very pleased with me. 
DOCTOR: Very pleased? 
ZOE: Well, I felt they were. 
DOCTOR: Zoe! Now, just you listen to me. Whatever else they are, these Krotons are certainly not friendly. Now we know that, don't we? 
ZOE: Yes, of course. 
DOCTOR: They use these machines to plant impressions on the mind. That's how they've enslaved these people all these years. 
SELRIS: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: What? 
SELRIS: Look at the dial. 
DOCTOR: Oh? What of it? 
SELRIS: It's amazing! Even the best of our students registered less than half that score. 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, Zoe is something of a genius. Of course it can be very irritating at times.

[Selris' house]

(Vana wakes with a start, gasping.) 
JAMIE: Vana! You're all right now. You're safe! 
VANA: The ball. The burning ball. 
JAMIE: What? 
VANA: It's over my head! 
JAMIE: Vana, there is nothing here now. 
VANA: No, no, I saw it. I saw it! 
JAMIE: Thara, look. 
(Thara takes Vana in his arms.) 
THARA: Now Vana, you're all right. There's nothing here. You're safe. 
VANA: It was flashing. All the lights. Burning my mind. The lights. 
THARA: Vana, you're all right now. You're home. 
VANA: Thara, is that you? 
THARA: At least she recognises me. Vana, listen. Nothing can hurt you now. You're going to be all right. 
VANA: Thara, I went into the machine. 
JAMIE: Did you see the Krotons? 
VANA: The ball. Flashing! Coming down on me! 
THARA: You're quite safe here, Vana! 
VANA: No, no. 
JAMIE: You'd better take these. Here. 
(Jamie gives Vana the tablets and some water.) 
JAMIE: Drink up now. All down. That's it. 
(Vana falls asleep.) 
JAMIE: Flashing ball burning her mind? 
THARA: What did she mean? Is it another of the Krotons weapons? 
JAMIE: I don't know. Look, you stay here with her. I'll go and get the Doctor.

[Learning Hall]

(The Doctor and Zoe are examining the door.) 
ZOE: It's crystalline. 
DOCTOR: Yes, it's hard but it's not brittle. I've never seen anything quite like it. 
ZOE: What was it like down there? 
DOCTOR: Mm? Oh, what Selris calls the foundations. Zoe, it was like a root structure. 
ZOE: A root structure? But indicates that 
DOCTOR: That this so-called machine is organic in structure. Yes. 
ZOE: Well, is that possible? 
DOCTOR: Well, why not? Some crystals do resemble simple virus forms. I wish I could get a bit of it for analysis. 
ZOE: Well if you're right that means that the whole of this machine is a sort of a living thing. 
DOCTOR: Well all life doesn't necessarily have feeling, you know. 
(A metallic clang echoes loudly.) 
DOCTOR: Great jumping gobstoppers! What's that? 
SELRIS: The Kroton's command. It means there is a message for me. 
(The hatch where the probe came out is open. Selris reaches in for a message pad.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, what does it say? 
SELRIS: Class three one nine seven. Selected female, Zo-Gond. 
DOCTOR: Zo-Gond? Zoe! They mean you! 
SELRIS: They've chosen you as a companion. 
DOCTOR: And we all know what happens to them, don't we? 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, what shall I do? 
DOCTOR: Well, she doesn't have to go, does she? Well, does she or doesn't she? 
SELRIS: I'm afraid she must. Complete obedience is the Krotons first command, and if we fail to obey 
DOCTOR: They'll destroy you, I see. 
ZOE: Oh dear. 
DOCTOR: Now do you see what you've done? Fooling around with this stupid machine! 
ZOE: Oh, but I'm not a Gond! 
DOCTOR: But that machine doesn't know that! 
ZOE: Where are you going? 
DOCTOR: I'm going to take the test. I can't let you go in there alone! What do I do? 
ZOE: Oh, sit down. And put this headset on. And press the button. Press the button! 
DOCTOR: All right, there's no need to shout! Now go away and don't fuss me. No, come back. What's this? It's all right, I know. Right, fire away. I'm ready. 
(Zoe gestures at him to press the button. The circling symbols come up but he doesn't manage to get them into coherent equations.) 
ZOE: Oh. Doctor, you've got it all wrong. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear, I've been working in square roots. Can I have that again, please? 
ZOE: Well they don't give you a second shots. Well, press the button again. 
SELRIS: This is the most advanced machine. Perhaps he can't answer the questions. 
ZOE: Of course he can. The Doctor's almost as clever as I am. 
SELRIS: I see. 
DOCTOR: Oh, now what have I done? 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, you've divided instead of multiplying. You must concentrate. 
DOCTOR: I am, Zoe! I am! 
(The computer watches the results needle flicker wildly from five to ten and try to bounce beyond the upper limit.) 
DOCTOR: Yes. I think that's rather better. I think I've scored more than you have, Zoe. 
ZOE: You answered more questions. Besides, this isn't supposed to be a competition. 
DOCTOR: It's clever, isn't it? The way they make you feel that they're pleased with you. 
ZOE: Yes. Perhaps the Krotons aren't as bad as we think. 
DOCTOR: What? Of course they are! What happens now? 
SELRIS: The Krotons will be waiting for Zoe. 
DOCTOR: Well, they can wait. We are going in there together. 
SELRIS: Normally the names don't come through for some time. 
ZOE: Well, mine did. 
SELRIS: Yes, but perhaps they were impressed with your performance, and that's why. 
(The gong sounds.) 
DOCTOR: Sounds a bit like a dinner gong, doesn't it Zoe? 
SELRIS: Class three one nine eight. Selected male, Doctor-Gond. 
DOCTOR: Doctor-Gond. Idiots! 
(The doorway opens.) 
ZOE: Well, it means you, anyway. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, are you ready? 
ZOE: I suppose we have to? 
DOCTOR: Well, we started this, we'd better go through with it. We've got to get to the bottom of this somehow, Zoe. 
ZOE: Oh, this is all my fault. 
DOCTOR: Oh, cheer up, cheer up. I expect it'll be quite interesting really. 
SELRIS: I am sorry, Doctor. My people will always remember you. 
DOCTOR: Eh? Oh. Oh, that's very nice of them. Stay close to me, Zoe. 
JAMIE: Doctor! No wait, come back! 
(The Doctor and Zoe have already stepped through and the door is closing.) 
JAMIE: What's happened? 
SELRIS: Your people are gone. They are now companions of the Krotons. 
JAMIE: What?

[Dynatrope control]

(A door opens and the Doctor and Zoe enter a room.) 
ZOE: It is a spaceship. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but there doesn't seem to be any crew. Hello? Anybody there? Is anybody at home? Hello? 
(They notice two seats.) 
ZOE: I think we've been asked to sit down. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think we have, Zoe. Er, Zoe, hold onto the end of this chain. 
(The Doctor hands Zoe one end of the chain of his pocket watch.) 
ZOE: What for? 
DOCTOR: Look up there. It's a force generator. This chain may help to equalise the power load. 
ZOE: Well, what are they going to do? 
(A hexagonal pillar-like object shines a light on them.) 
ZOE: Doctor, I can't move. 
DOCTOR: No, it's a forcefield. Try and relax. Relax. 
(A device lowers from the ceiling, sending a beam of light whirling around the room.)

[Learning Hall]

JAMIE: But why did you let them go? 
SELRIS: It is the command of the Krotons. 
JAMIE: Och, the Krotons! They just rap out an order and everyone jumps, don't they? Aye, well, I'm not just standing here to see my 
SELRIS: Where are you going? 
JAMIE: To find a way into this box of tricks! 
(Jamie thumps on the door.)

[Dynatrope control]

(A tube in the pillar is filling with liquid. The Doctor and Zoe are under considerable strain. The chain they are holding begins to smoke. Elsewhere, bubbles form in vats. The Doctor and Zoe pass out briefly.) 
DOCTOR: Are you all right, Zoe? Oh! 
ZOE: Yes, I think so. 
DOCTOR: Oh! 
ZOE: What happened? 
DOCTOR: Oh, some tremendous power. Oh! 
ZOE: They seem to have a way of transferring mental power to pure energy. 
DOCTOR: Yes. And they used it, or rather us, to operate a thermal switch. 
ZOE: Doctor, look! 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
(The vats are next to them, bubbling away.) 
ZOE: I thought there was a wall here. 
DOCTOR: Yes, there was. Zoe, I think that I'm beginning to understand. 
ZOE: What's that? 
DOCTOR: That's curious. Zoe, I think we've gone and done it. 
ZOE: What? 
DOCTOR: Well, now just a minute, I've got an idea. 
(The Doctor takes out a sample bottle and takes some liquid from the vats.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. This is a form of slurry. Crystals in suspension. 
ZOE: But what's its purpose? 
DOCTOR: Well, life is supposed to have begun on your planet in the sea. Primeval soup, someone once called it. Well, there are lots of sorts of soups, aren't there? I wonder what this sort is? 
ZOE: And what do you suppose these are? They look like astronauts' air lines. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think you're right, Zoe. Zoe, look! 
(Something solid is forming in the vats.) 
ZOE: Oh, Doctor! 
DOCTOR: I think it's time we got out of here. Come along!

[Dynatrope corridor]

ZOE: Well, what are we going to do if we do get out? We haven't learned anything yet. 
DOCTOR: Yes, we have, once we can analyse this. Now, come on. 
(A metal-crystal creature has got out of the vat and has one of the 'air' lines attached to its middle. A second one is in the process of forming.)

[Learning Hall]

SELRIS: There is no way in. 
JAMIE: Look, there's a door here if I can just get it open. 
SELRIS: No one can enter unless the Krotons wish it. 
JAMIE: Well, we'll see about that. All I need is some sort of crowbar.

[Dynatrope control]

(The second creature is out of the vat.) 
KROTON: The Gonds should be here. 
KROTON 2: They are in the exit shaft. 
KROTON: Why? They are conditioned to obey. 
KROTON 2: The conditioning may have failed.

[Dynatrope exit shaft]

(The Doctor and Zoe go through an area with tubes on the walls and a strange object in the centre. They push their way past hanging tubes to another door.) 
ZOE: It should slide somewhere. 
DOCTOR: Yes, there must be a trip-mechanism. 
ZOE: Doctor, look. There's a photoelectric cell here. It can't be working. 
DOCTOR: Well, if it's not working. 
ZOE: Then the Krotons have cut the circuit. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZOE: Then we're trapped. They know we're here! 
DOCTOR: Just a moment, I have an idea. 
ZOE: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: That piece of mica I picked up. Here we are. Now, if I can use it to bridge the gap. 
ZOE: Will mica work? 
DOCTOR: Well, the whole machine's made of crystal. 
(The Doctor wedges the rock in the hole, and the door opens.) 
DOCTOR: Wait! The poison jet.

[Dynatrope control]

(On a viewscreen, the Krotons are watching exit from outside of the Dynatrope.) 
KROTON: They have activated the circuit. 
KROTON 2: Then the dispersion unit will kill them.

[Dynatrope exit shaft]

ZOE: Doctor, we've got to risk it. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but jump down to the side. Don't go down the ramp.

[Dynatrope control]

(The Krotons watch the Doctor and Zoe come out, get off the side of the ramp and run away.) 
KROTON: They are not Gonds. 
KROTON 2: Why did you inoperate the dispersion unit? 
KROTON: We need them alive. 
KROTON 2: They have escaped. 
KROTON: Keep the scanner on them. We will order the Gonds to capture them and bring them back. 
(Jamie is on another monitor.) 
KROTON: That is not a Gond. 
KROTON 2: It is possible they have evolved. 
KROTON: There has not been time. It is a similar biped animal, but not from this planet. It is possible that these higher anthropoids have take over the planet. 
(An image of Selris.) 
KROTON 2: That is a Gond. These creatures are in alliance with the Gonds. 
KROTON: Let us take this one. (Jamie) Its mind will have the capacity we need.

[Learning Hall]

(Jamie is levering at the door with a crowbar when it opens.) 
JAMIE: At last. 
SELRIS: No! Don't enter. 
JAMIE: Look, I have this. 
(Jamie and his crowbar enter the Dynatrope.)

[Dynatrope control]

(Jamie enters, and his arm is grabbed by a Kroton's claw. He drops the crowbar and is forced onto a chair.) 
KROTON [OC]: Have you damaged it? 
KROTON 2: No. It is alive. Animal tissue is weak. 
KROTON [OC]: It is recovering. Test its mind. 
(Jamie is pinned down by the glowing ball of light.) 
KROTON 2: This is not a high-brain. It is a primitive. 
KROTON [OC]: Then the power will kill it. 
(Jamie collapses.)

Episode Three

[Dynatrope control]

(The Krotons have turned of the mind-draining device early.) 
KROTON 2: It is still of value. It can give information about the other creatures.) 
(A monitor shows the Doctor and Zoe striding across the wastelands.)

[Wastelands]

ZOE: But this isn't the way to the city. 
DOCTOR: No, it's the way to the Tardis. 
ZOE: The Tardis? But we can't leave Jamie behind. 
DOCTOR: Well, don't worry about him. He's perfectly safe, isn't he? Come on!

[Dynatrope control]

(Jamie awakes.) 
JAMIE: Oh, my head. 
KROTON 2: Where are you from? 
JAMIE: Oh, it's you. I thought I'd dreamt you up. 
KROTON 2: Where are you from? 
JAMIE: Earth. 
KROTON: You are of the same race as these bipeds? 
(The Doctor and Zoe are on the monitor.) 
JAMIE: Zoe and the Doctor. Where are they? 
KROTON: You are space travellers? 
JAMIE: They got out. Good old Doctor. 
KROTON: Answer! 
(The Kroton grabs Jamie's arm in its pincer.) 
JAMIE: You're breaking my arm! 
KROTON 2: Do not damage the creature. 
(A revolving helmet is lowered to just above Jamie's head.) 
KROTON: You and these other creatures are space travellers? 
JAMIE: Yes. 
KROTON 2: Commander. 
(The Tardis is on the monitor.) 
KROTON: What is that? 
JAMIE: It's the Tardis. 
KROTON: What is its function? 
JAMIE: It travels through time and space. 
KROTON 2: Range zero seven. Dispersion unit on target. 
(The Doctor and Zoe enter the Tardis.) 
KROTON 2: They are leaving. Shall I fire? 
JAMIE: They're not leaving. They wouldn't.

[Beta's house]

(Beta is adding liquid to a pan hung over a raised fire place in the middle of the room. Eelek and Axus enter with guards.) 
BETA: You wish to see me? 
EELEK: You got my message? 
BETA: That the council requires my advice? On a matter of science, I presume. 
EELEK: On a matter of war. 
BETA: War? 
EELEK: Against the Krotons. 
BETA: War against the Krotons? Are you both out of your minds? 
(Axus threatens Beta with his axe.) 
AXUS: Now you listen to me! 
EELEK: Axus! Not yet. Beta, you're a scientist. Surely you want to be free of the Krotons? 
BETA: Free, yes. Dead, no. 
AXUS: We can defeat them. 
BETA: Can we? Our ancestors tried. 
EELEK: They were savages. Primitive men with clubs and stones. 
AXUS: We are much more advanced now. 
BETA: Are we? All our knowledge is given us by the Krotons. 
EELEK: Then we can use it against them. 
BETA: You're talking nonsense, Eelek. We only know what the Krotons tell us. We don't think. We obey. 
AXUS: He could help us if he wasn't afraid of the Krotons. 
BETA: Don't you think I want to be free of them? Don't you think I want to discover truth for myself instead of being fed information like a dog with scraps? 
EELEK: Then you will help us? 
BETA: To fight the Krotons? Listen, I've just been talking to the stranger, the Doctor. He made me realise how pitifully little the Krotons tell us. 
EELEK: I would forget the Doctor if I were you, and his friends. 
BETA: What do you mean? 
EELEK: They submitted themselves to the teaching machines in the Learning Hall. 
BETA: What happened? 
AXUS: The Doctor and the girl scored the highest result ever. The Krotons summoned them, they went into the machine and the boy followed them. 
EELEK: So now they'll be dead like Abu-Gond, or mindless like Vana. So you will help us? 
BETA: Give me time, Eelek. There are certain things the Krotons forbid us to study. Fluids which eat away metal and flesh. In time I can develop some way of attacking them. 
EELEK: In time! It's always in time, isn't it? Just give us a little more time. Just be a little more patient. Always time, a little more time! 
BETA: We've been slaves for a thousand years. Do you think you can free us in one day? 
EELEK: Yes! 
BETA: Why don't you wait and see what Selris has to say? 
EELEK: You will no longer obey Selris. You will obey me. 
[Dynatrope control]

(The Tardis is still on a monitor.) 
KROTON 2: Shall I fire, Commander? 
KROTON: We cannot kill them. We need their minds. You will leave the Dynatrope and fetch them back. 
(The junior Kroton picks up a canister from a rack and leaves.) 
KROTON: What is the operating principle of your craft? 
JAMIE: Er, you mean how does it work? Well, only the Doctor knows that. 
KROTON: What is its transference interval? 
JAMIE: Transference interval? Well, er, what's that? 
KROTON: You have no value. 
KROTON 2 [OC]: Vision control required now. 
(On the monitor, the Kroton is tottering slowly down the ramp to the wasteland.) 
KROTON: On control and proceed.

[Selris' house]

SELRIS: How is Vana? 
THARA: Better. Much better, but very tired. She'll be all right by morning though. 
SELRIS: That is good news. 
THARA: Are the strangers still in the Learning Hall? 
SELRIS: They're gone. 
THARA: You mean they've left, they've gone back? 
SELRIS: They went into the machine. 
THARA: What? 
SELRIS: The Krotons sent for Zoe, and the Doctor insisted on going as well. 
THARA: You let them go? Why didn't you stop them? 
SELRIS: What could I do? It is the will of the Krotons. 
THARA: But why didn't they run? Why did they go in when they know what must happen? 
SELRIS: Because they knew what would happen if they failed to obey. 
THARA: But not to them, Father. They could have escaped in their machine. 
SELRIS: There is a council meeting. 
THARA: Council meeting. Is that all you can ever think about, talking? What about some action, Father? You think the Krotons are still our great benefactors, don't you? 
SELRIS: No, Thara. I think of them as enemies. We're powerless against them. 
THARA: Well, Eelek is going to do something about it. 
VANA: Thara? 
THARA: It's all right, Vana. You're quite safe. 
VANA: I feel so faint. 
THARA: Try to sleep now. We're looking after you.

[Dynatrope control]

KROTON: Radius one eight one vector five. Do not move. 
JAMIE: Er, I was just stretching my leg. Look, what are you going to do with me? 
KROTON: You have no value. 
JAMIE: What do you mean? 
KROTON: You will be dispersed.

[Selris' house]

SELRIS: Thara, what did you mean about Eelek? 
THARA: I meant you don't know what's happening. He is no longer your deputy. He's taken over as council leader. 
SELRIS: He has no authority! 
THARA: A vote was taken! 
SELRIS: A vote? 
THARA: Listen, everybody in the city knows how the Krotons have tricked us. Eelek announced it. 
SELRIS: The fool! They will want revenge. 
THARA: Well, exactly, and that's what Eelek has promised them. 
SELRIS: Can't you understand? Eelek doesn't care what happens to our people. 
THARA: Eelek is a patriot. 
SELRIS: It is not patriotism to lead people into a war they cannot win. 
THARA: We can't let the Krotons rule us forever without putting up some sort of fight. 
SELRIS: We will be strong one day. We will fight them. 
THARA: After another thousand years? 
SELRIS: Eelek must be stopped. 
THARA: How? He won't listen to you. Our people want this war because of what happened to Vana and the others. 
SELRIS: And how does Eelek intend to fight the Krotons? March on the machine? 
THARA: Do you have a better idea? 
SELRIS: There is a way we could fight them, and that is by not letting them suspect that they are being attacked.

[Dynatrope control] KROTON: Radius one seven nine, vector five. 
JAMIE: Zoe and the Doctor, what are you going to do with them? 
KROTON: They are needed for the Dynatrope. 
JAMIE: Dynatrope? That's this machine, then? 
KROTON: One six eight vector four. 
JAMIE: Well, why does it need them? And why have you been killing the Gonds? 
KROTON: The Dynatrope needs high brains for transfer power. The Gonds have no high brains. 
JAMIE: Aye, and that makes it all right to kill them, does it? 
KROTON: That is procedure. Radius one six three vector four. 
(Jamie looks towards a canister on the rack.)

[Council chamber]

BETA: Selris should be here. He's still the council leader, or am I mistaken. 
AXUS: You are mistaken. 
EELEK: Selris is old. In time of war we need a strong leader. 
AXUS: And Eelek has taken command. 
BETA: So at last you've achieved your ambition, eh? 
EELEK: Yes, and I have the support of the whole council. 
BETA: It must be quite a change for you to feel popular. 
EELEK: And there is a limit to what I will take from you. 
BETA: I'm wondering just how popular you'll be when hundreds of our people have been killed. Do you want a repetition of the massacre we suffered when the Krotons first came here? 
EELEK: Today we have slings and fireballs. Weapons that will destroy the strongest building to rubble 
BETA: Have you ever looked at the wasteland? Nothing grows there even to this day. It smells of death. Compared with their kind of weapons, I tell you we still only have clubs and stones.

[Dynatrope control]

JAMIE: I mean, how would you like to die without knowing the reason, eh? 
KROTON: Krotons cannot die. 
JAMIE: You mean you can't be killed? You live forever? 
(Jamie has got up and is edging towards the rack while the Kroton has its back to him, directing its companion to the Tardis.) 
KROTON: We function permanently, unless we exhaust. 
JAMIE: Exhaust? 
KROTON: Radius one five two, vector three. 
JAMIE: How do you mean by exhaust? 
KROTON: The exhaust procedure is merely a reversion to basic molecules, but the matter can be re-animated. 
JAMIE: Well, what about me, though? I mean, I can't be re-animated. Why kill me? 
KROTON: One four nine, vector three. 
JAMIE: I mean, what good will it do you? 
KROTON: All waste matter must be dispersed. That is procedure. 
(Jamie gets his hands on a canister.)

[Outside the Tardis]

(The Kroton surveys the cliff in front of it. Meanwhile, the Doctor comes out of the Tardis with a carpet bag and his sample bottle. Zoe follows.) 
DOCTOR: So, these creatures have a life system based on tellurium, eh? It's fascinating, isn't it Zoe? Then that tank must have been a polarised centrifuge. 
ZOE: Which we activated. 
DOCTOR: Oh, don't blame yourself, Zoe. That machine must have lain around for thousands of years waiting for someone as clever as us to turn up. 
ZOE: Just like a giant mousetrap. And those poor Gond students have been the mice. 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's horrible. Still, you must admit, that it's a very good way of existing through time. 
ZOE: What are you doing? 
DOCTOR: Oh, there's some deposits of sulphur around here somewhere. 
ZOE: Yes, Jamie remarked about the smell as soon as we stepped out of the Tardis. 
DOCTOR: Hydrogen telluride. 
ZOE: What? Oh, of course. The worst smell in the world. 
DOCTOR: The worst smell in any world. 
ZOE: Why didn't I think of that? 
DOCTOR: Zoe, I'd say it was a safe bet that that machine is composed of tellurium. 
ZOE: Doctor, what do you want sulphur for? 
DOCTOR: Oh, it'll come in useful. It's very useful stuff, sulphur, you know. Very useful stuff indeed. 
ZOE: I've got a funny feeling we're being watched.

[Dynatrope control]

KROTON: Radius three zero, vector one. Two zero, objective in range. 
(Zoe is on the second monitor.) 
JAMIE: (sotto) Get back in the Tardis, will you? Go on. 
KROTON: Radius one zero. 
JAMIE: (sotto) Go on.

[Outside the Tardis]

(The Doctor is filling his bag with rocks.) 
DOCTOR: Look at this. It's almost pure sulphur. 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, can we go now? 
DOCTOR: Yes, in a minute. What do you know about tellurium, Zoe? 
ZOE: Well, it's one of the exceptional elements in the periodic table. It's atomic weight is a hundred and twenty eight. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZOE: And it's atomic number is fifty 
(Zoe trails off and looks behind her.) 
DOCTOR: Mmm hmm. Well, go on. 
ZOE: It doesn't really matter anymore. 
DOCTOR: Oh, my giddy aunt. 
KROTON 2: You will return to the Dynatrope. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Well, yes, if you put it that way. I wonder perhaps if I were to 
(The Doctor grabs for the bag.) 
KROTON: Return! 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes!

[Dynatrope control]

(Jamie hauls the heavy canister off the rack and aims its funnel at the Kroton.) 
KROTON: Stop! 
JAMIE: Now we'll see if you die or not. 
KROTON: Stop! Stop! 
(As the Kroton waddles towards him, Jamie manages to get the canister to spew its gas at it.) 
KROTON: Stop! Stop! 
(The canister stops emitting gas and the Kroton reaches for Jamie.) 
KROTON: Stop! 
(The Kroton pins Jamie against the wall.)

[Outside the Tardis]

(The Kroton is swinging around as if it is suddenly blind.) 
KROTON 2: Direction point. Direction point. I have lost contact. 
DOCTOR: Quick, Zoe. Up there. Run! 
(The Doctor and Zoe run off.) 
KROTON 2: Direction point required immediately.

[Dynatrope control]

KROTON: Radius one zero, vector three. 
KROTON 2 [OC]: Do I proceed? 
KROTON: No. Wait. The auto-scanner has lost contact. You will destroy the Tardis machine. 
KROTON 2 [OC]: Direction point? 
KROTON: Radius four one, vector two. 
(The image on the monitor stops swinging from side to side and settles on the Tardis.)

[Cliffside]

(Looking down at the Kroton and the Tardis.) 
ZOE: Can't it see? 
DOCTOR: No, apparently not in the light. It was dark in the machine, wasn't it. 
ZOE: Look, it's moving again now. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZOE: It's going towards the Tardis! 
DOCTOR: Yes, it's being directed by the machine's scanners. 
(The Kroton fires its canister at the Tardis. When the gas clears, the space is empty.) 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, the Tardis! 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZOE: Well, now what shall we do? 
DOCTOR: Well, there's nothing we can do till that wretched Kroton moves away.

[Dynatrope control]

(Jamie is on the floor, waking up.) 
KROTON 2 [OC]: Further instructions? 
KROTON: Return to the Dynatrope. 
KROTON 2: Direction point? 
KROTON: Reverse the readings. 
(The Kroton turns and Jamie pretends to still be unconscious.)

[Cliffside]

(The Kroton leaves, and the Tardis rematerialises further up the cliff.) 
ZOE: Look, it's all right again! 
DOCTOR: Yes, what a stupid place to land. You can tell that the Captain is not at the helm, can't you? 
ZOE: You knew it would vanish like that, didn't you? 
DOCTOR: Well it only does that, you see, if I remember to set the HADS. 
ZOE: The what? 
DOCTOR: The HADS. The Hostile Action Displacement System. If the Tardis is attacked, it automatically dematerialises. Now, I think it's safe for us to move now. 
ZOE: Oh, to move where? 
DOCTOR: Well, er, we've got to tell the Gonds that we're all right, haven't we? And Jamie'll be worried. Come along, now. Carefully.

[Council chamber]

EELEK: First we destroy the Learning Hall, then we make a frontal attack. 
BETA: Suicide! 
AXUS: What does the Controller of Science know of war? 
BETA: You came here asking my advice. I've given it. Wait until we can develop effective weapons. 
EELEK: And how long will that take? I say attack now. 
(Selris enters.) 
SELRIS: No, Eelek! 
BETA: You'll be pleased to know he's taken your place as leader of the council. 
SELRIS: To lead an attack on the Krotons? 
EELEK: That is my plan. 
SELRIS: I forbid it! 
EELEK: You can't forbid anything. Order the slings and fireballs to be prepared. 
(Gonds leave.) 
EELEK: They've heard enough of your plans. 
(Eelek leaves.) 
BETA: Slings and fireballs will never reach the Krotons while they're still in that machine. 
SELRIS: Exactly, Beta, and I have a plan to draw them out. Now under the Hall of Learning there are three pillars which support the machine.

[Dynatrope control]

(The second Kroton has returned, and both are busy at the control panel.) 
KROTON: The high brains must be recaptured before exhaust time. 
KROTON 2: Captive aliens are dispersed. 
KROTON: Check exhaust time. 
KROTON 2: Commence check. 
(Jamie gets up.) 
KROTON: Ileal power stat is? 
KROTON 2: Static. 
KROTON: Gravitation feed? 
KROTON 2: Normal. 
(Jamie carefully backs away to the doorway.) 
KROTON: Auxiliary output. 
KROTON 2: Rising. 
KROTON: Dynatrope balance. 
KROTON 2: Balance four. 
KROTON: The Dynatrope will exhaust in three hours. 
(Jamie leaves.)

[Selris' house]

THARA: Are you sure you're strong enough? 
VANA: Of course. I'm all right now. 
THARA: I can carry you. 
VANA: That won't be necessary. I'll walk, Thara. 
THARA: It's a long way to the hills. 
(The Doctor and Zoe enter.) 
VANA: Doctor, you're back! 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sorry we've been so long. 
THARA: But we thought you were dead. 
Zoe: Dead? 
VANA: Selris said you'd gone into the machine. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, well, we did, but, er, well, what goes in must come out, mustn't it? You're better, aren't you. Sit down. 
VANA: Much. 
DOCTOR: You mustn't. Oh, I'm glad to see you're going on holiday. 
THARA: Holiday? We aren't 
DOCTOR: Well it looks as though 
THARA: The city's being evacuated. 
DOCTOR: Evacuated? What do you mean? 
THARA: My father's going to lead an attack against the Krotons. He hopes they'll strike back and come out into the open. 
DOCTOR: But didn't he learn his lesson last night? 
THARA: He's going to attack the machine from underneath. 
VANA: Demolish the machine's supports. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think that's a very good idea! Zoe, there's no time to be lost. Will you take us to Beta, please?

[Under Hall]

(The Gonds are using mallets to fasten large chains around the base of the metal supports.) 
SELRIS: Ready with the stop-draw? Now! 
(The chains are pulled taut from above.)

[Beta's house]

BETA: Thara, if you've come to try to persuade me to leave, you're wasting your time. 
THARA: I haven't. The Doctor asked to see your laboratory. 
DOCTOR: Can you hold my bag please? There's a small job I want you to do. 
BETA: What's that? 
DOCTOR: It's sulphur. I've written out some instructions here. I don't know whether you can follow them. Can you? 
BETA: Yes, I think so. But the Krotons forbid us to study chemistry. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Beta, did it ever occur to you to wonder why? 
ZOE: Doctor, where's Jamie? (to Vana) He's supposed to be looking after you. Well, where's he got to? 
THARA: He followed you out to the Learning Hall. 
DOCTOR: I haven't seen him since this morning. 
ZOE: You don't suppose he tried to get into the machine, do you? 
DOCTOR: Come on. We must go. 
ZOE: Yes, let's! 
DOCTOR: Give me a sample of that as soon as you can. (The Doctor and Zoe leave.) 
THARA: Vana, I'm staying here to help. 
BETA: Oh no you're not. You're going up to the hills, the pair of you. 
VANA: Oh don't be ridiculous, Beta. We're not leaving you here. Besides, I feel quite faint. I don't think I could walk a step.

[Dynatrope control]

(The Krotons heads are spinning around.) 
KROTON 2: The gravitation feed is dropping. 
KROTON: The Dynatrope is moving out of balance. Static beam switch to full volume. 
KROTON 2: Full volume on. 
KROTON: Systems check commence.

[Under Hall]

(A Gond is cranking a capstan, tightening the chain.) 
SELRIS: Shine the light up there. 
(The ceiling is cracking.) 
BETA: If that comes down we shall all be killed! 
SELRIS: But the machine will come down first. Look at the vibration! 
(Gonds head for the stairs as the Doctor and Zoe enter.) 
DOCTOR: Stop it! Stop it! 
SELRIS: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: What do you think you're doing, you idiots? Unhook the thing! You're meddling with things you don't understand! 
(The Doctor runs to the capstan.) 
ZOE: Doctor, look out! 
(A piece of the ceiling falls.) 
DOCTOR: Zoe! Run! Run! 
(Rubble falls on the Doctor, knocking him down and burying him.)

Episode Four

[Learning Hall]

(The roof of the Learning Hall has fallen in too. Thara and Vana enter.) 
THARA: I'm going down. You go back. 
VANA: Be careful, Thara. 
[Under Hall]

ZOE: Doctor! 
THARA: Are you all right, Zoe? 
ZOE: Yes, I think so. 
THARA: Come on, this way. 
ZOE: No, we must find the Doctor. 
THARA: Well, where is he? 
ZOE: Somewhere over there. I saw him fall. 
THARA: I'll look for him. You stay under here.

[Learning Hall]

SELRIS: Vana, what are you doing here? Why aren't you in the hills? 
VANA: Thara and I stayed behind with Beta to make some acid. We were bringing it here for the Doctor when we felt the earthquake. 
SELRIS: The Doctor? Has anyone seen him? 
VANA: He's probably buried down there with the digging party.

[Under Hall]

THARA: I've found him, Zoe! 
(Thara helps the Doctor up.) 
THARA: Are all right, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I think so. I don't think there's any bones broken. But if they don't get that vibration under control soon 
THARA: We must hurry. There's going to be a 
DOCTOR: Oh, look out! 
(Another piece of ceiling falls, and Thara is trapped by a large piece of masonry on his leg.) 
DOCTOR: Thara! Oh, don't worry, we'll get it off you. Zoe! Zoe! 
(The Doctor and Zoe struggle to move the rock.)

[Dynatrope control]

(While Jamie picks his way through the shaking spaceship, and through the area of pipes and cable towards the exit, the Krotons heads are spinning very fast indeed.) 
KROTON: Cut auxiliaries. 
KROTON 2: Auxiliaries cut. Output zero. 
KROTON: Feed in emergency power. Gravitation feed check. 
KROTON 2: Static. 
(Their heads stop spinning.) 
KROTON: Dynatrope balance normal. 
KROTON 2: The Gonds have attacked the Dynatrope. 
(On the monitor, the Doctor and Zoe are dragging Thara to the stairs of the Under Hall.) 
KROTON: The two high brains are there. Bring them here.

[Under Hall]

(Vana cradles Thara's head while Zoe checks his leg.) 
ZOE: Could be a fracture. 
THARA: It feels painful enough. 
ZOE: I'll strap it. Oh Doctor, give me the wood. 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, hurry up, Zoe. We've got to move out of here, you know. 
VANA: You think there'll be another earthquake? 
DOCTOR: Oh, that was not an earthquake. 
VANA: The noise was coming from the machine, but it's stopped. 
DOCTOR: Yes. That means the Krotons are free to deal with us. Haven't you finished yet, Zoe? 
ZOE: No I haven't. Hey, can I borrow your braces? 
DOCTOR: No! Here, I'd much rather you use this. (pocket handkerchief) 
ZOE: Oh, all right. 
DOCTOR: Hello. 
SELRIS: Yes Doctor, I'm afraid we have failed. The machine is unharmed. 
DOCTOR: I'm not so sure - look at that. 
(A sphere is leaking fluid.) 
SELRIS: What has happened to it? 
DOCTOR: I'd say it was no longer functioning under full power. Vana, how is Beta getting on with the acid I asked him to make? 
VANA: Oh, he sent this, Doctor. 
(Vana gives the Doctor a bottle of liquid.) 
DOCTOR: Oh good. 
VANA: He only made a small amount to start with. 
(The Doctor and Zoe smell the liquid.) 
VANA: Is it all right? 
ZOE: Poo. Sulphuric acid. 
DOCTOR: Yes, basically, with a few things added. Don't touch, it'll burn you. 
ZOE: Doctor, what about Jamie? 
DOCTOR: Jamie! I'd forgotten all about him in the excitement! 
ZOE: Has anybody seen him? 
SELRIS: But he followed you. 
DOCTOR: Followed us? What, in there? 
SELRIS: Yes, I tried to 
ZOE: Well, how long ago? 
SELRIS: About an hour after you and the Doctor. 
ZOE: But Doctor, Jamie wouldn't be any use to them. His mind is completely untrained. 
DOCTOR: Yes, and if the machine rejects him like the others? Come on! 
VANA: Doctor!

[Dynatrope exit]

(Jamie has made it to the door out to the wastelands but he can't open it. His foot kicks something on the floor.) 
JAMIE: The Doctor's piece of mica. 
(Jamie picks up the rock and compares it to the hole set into the wall by the door.)

[Learning Hall]

EELEK: Well? Are you satisfied with your efforts? 
AXUS: Seven of his working party are unaccounted for. There are four badly injured and I think two are going to die. 
SELRIS: They will all be attended to. I am making arrangements. 
EELEK: No, you've done enough already. 
SELRIS: But you are the one who wanted to fight with the Krotons. 
EELEK: I'll fight them. In my own way, in my own time. 
SELRIS: I tell you my way is better. Inside the machine the Krotons are invulnerable, but if we can draw them out 
AXUS: You've had your chance and look what you've done. The Learning Hall is ruined, our people are dead and wounded, and the machine is untouched. 
SELRIS: The machine is damaged! 
EELEK: Damaged. It must be destroyed! I will launch a mass attack with slings and fireballs. They are in position now. 
SELRIS: And the Krotons will turn our city into another wasteland. Don't be a fool, Eelek. 
(Eelek uncovers another corpse.) 
EELEK: Do you see what your stupidity has done? You are a traitor. You were dismissed as leader of then council. You had no authority to order this attack! 
SELRIS: The leadership of this council is hereditary! My son Thara will replace me! 
EELEK: No, I have replaced you! Arrest him! 
SELRIS: Wait! Eelek, this is no time for us to be fighting among ourselves. Let me help you organise 
EELEK: I have no need of your help. 
SELRIS: I said I would bring the Krotons out of the machine. 
(The door from the Dynatrope into the Learning Hall opens. A Kroton comes out with a gas canister. Eelek approaches it.) 
KROTON 2: Stop! 
EELEK: What do you want? 
KROTON 2: Where are the high brains? 
EELEK: I don't understand. 
KROTON 2: The two alien creatures are needed. Where are they? 
SELRIS: He means the Doctor and Zoe. What do you want with them? 
KROTON 2: Unimportant. Produce them. 
EELEK: They're not here. 
KROTON 2: Where are they? 
EELEK: You say you need them. Why are they so important to you? You never left your machine before. 
KROTON 2: Do not argue! 
(The Kroton uses the killer gas on a nearby Gond.) 
SELRIS: Why did you do that? He was doing you no harm! 
KROTON 2: Produce the high brains in fifteen minutes. 
EELEK: If we give you the strangers, will you leave us in peace? 
KROTON 2: The high brains will enable us to operate the drive mechanism of the Dynatrope. 
EELEK: You mean you will go? You will leave our world? 
KROTON 2: Yes. But if the two high brains are not brought to the Dynatrope, you will all be dispersed. Do you understand? 
EELEK: Very well. If you leave us, you shall have them. 
(At the exit door, Jamie presses the mica into the hole, and the door raises just enough for him to crawl under.) 
SELRIS: But why, Eelek? It's only a few hours since you wanted to fight the Krotons. 
EELEK: If we give them the strangers they will leave us in peace. 
SELRIS: But the Doctor and Zoe are our friends. They risked their lives for us. 
EELEK: I put the interests of our own people first. Now, keep them all under guard.

[Outside the Dynatrope]

(Jamie has got himself stuck crawling under the door.) 
JAMIE: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
JAMIE: Quick! 
DOCTOR: Jamie, watch out for the poison jets! (Zoe and the Doctor run up the ramp.) 
JAMIE: It's just on my back. 
DOCTOR: We've got to get you out of here! 
(Zoe and the Doctor pull at Jamie's arms.) 
JAMIE: I know! 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
JAMIE: It's just another inch, I think. 
DOCTOR: I think you're getting free. 
(They pull Jamie out from under the door.) 
ZOE: Quick! 
(The three run off to the side just as the nozzles start to release the gas.) 
DOCTOR: Oh! 
JAMIE: What's been happening? I though that machine was going to shake itself to pieces. 
DOCTOR: There's no time to explain, Jamie. How are you feeling? 
JAMIE: Well 
DOCTOR: Good. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
DOCTOR: There's something I want you to do for me. 
JAMIE: Oh, not again. 
DOCTOR: Now Beta is making some special sulphuric acid for us. I want you to go and tell him to make it in bulk. 
JAMIE: Yes, but 
DOCTOR: As much as he can. 
JAMIE: But, Doctor 
DOCTOR: There's no time to argue. Now hurry. We'll see you back at the Learning Hall.

[Learning Hall]

EELEK: The strangers are coming back. You two stay here, the rest come with me. 
VANA: They're going to walk into a trap. 
SELRIS: Yes. Eelek claims to act for the people, but he's only concern is his own skin. 
VANA: Oh, if only we could warn the Doctor. He and the girl could get away in their space machine. 
SELRIS: I agree. We owe them the chance to escape.

[Beta's house]

(Beta and Jamie are using kerchiefs to protect their lungs from the noxious fumes.) 
JAMIE: How long will it be? How long will it be? 
BETA: I don't know. 
(There is a flash from one of the pots.) 
JAMIE: It's not going to explode, is it? 
BETA: I don't know. 
JAMIE: What? 
BETA: I don't know! 
JAMIE: Well, I thought you were supposed to be the scientist? 
BETA: But I've never worked with acid before. 
(Beta puts a drop on his finger.) 
BETA: Ow! The Krotons forbid it. Shall we put a bit more in? 
JAMIE: Well, why ask me? 
BETA: Let's see what happens. We can only blow ourselves up. 
(Beta tips more powdered sulphur into his pan as Jamie backs away.) 
BETA: Do you think that's enough? 
JAMIE: Aye, well, it's enough for me anyway. Quite enough. 
(Another pan goes Flash!)

[Learning Hall]

(Thara is still lying on a stone block, helpless.) 
VANA: Listen, you distract Axus's attention while I slip away. 
THARA: But there are men on the stairs. 
VANA: I might be able to dodge by them. Anything's worth trying. 
SELRIS: Yes, there is just a chance. But be ready. Axus, a minute. 
AXUS: What is it? 
SELRIS: In the past you have always accepted my judgement. Believe me, the Krotons are not to be trusted. 
AXUS: I don't trust them. But Eelek's right, we're doing the only thing we can. 
SELRIS: But if we surrender the Doctor and Zoe, we ourselves will be killed. 
AXUS: What do you mean? 
SELRIS: I'm sure of it. The Krotons don't care for us. They never have. But while we have the Doctor and Zoe, we have a means of negotiation. 
AXUS: And if we don't hand over the strangers they'll kill us anyway. You're getting old, Selris. Your arguments make no sense. 
(Axus turns and sees Vana on the steps.) 
AXUS: Stop! Stop that girl! 
(Vana is halfway up the steps when two guards grab her and bring her down again. She drops the bottle of acid.) 
VANA: Help! Let me go! Let me go! Doctor! Doctor! 
(Selris picks up the bottle.)

[Dynatrope control]

KROTON 2: Balance zero plus twelve. 
KROTON: We have reserve power for twenty seven more minutes. 
KROTON 2: Then we shall exhaust. 
KROTON: Our function will end.

[Learning Hall]

(The Doctor and Zoe are creeping down the steps. They don't notice Eelek behind them.) 
ZOE: What do we do next? 
DOCTOR: Well, if only we can get inside that machine again, Zoe. 
EELEK: You can, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Oh? 
EELEK: We'll help you into it. 
DOCTOR: Oh, that's very good of (guards surround them) What? What's all this? 
ZOE: Oh. Oh Doctor.

[Dynatrope control]

(The Krotons watch the Doctor and Zoe on the monitor.) 
KROTON: The high brains have been captured. Balance check. 
KROTON 2: Zero plus nine. 
KROTON: Exhaust time twenty two minutes. 
KROTON 2: Shall I enter the Dynatrope? 
KROTON: Only the two high brains must enter.

[Learning Hall]

EELEK: Well, take them up. 
DOCTOR: Really! We will not be bullied. Don't push! (sotto) Vana! Vana, have you got that bottle? It's vital! 
KROTON [OC]: The high brains will enter immediately. 
ZOE: I think we'd better do as they say, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Vana? Oh. 
(The guards make sure the Doctor and Zoe go through the door.)

[Dynatrope control]  

KROTON 2: The high brains are entering the Dynatrope. 
KROTON: Prepare for take off. Phase one. 
KROTON 2: Phase one ready. Shall I destroy the Gonds now? They are of no value. 
KROTON: No. The dispersion units use power. We have no power to waste.

[Learning Hall]

VANA: That bottle, Selris. 
SELRIS: It's all right. I have it here. 
VANA: The Doctor needs it. He says it's vital! 
(Selris runs dives through the doorway to the Dynatrope as it is closing.) 
VANA: Come back!

[Dynatrope control]

DOCTOR: I believe you wish to speak with us. 
(Selris runs in and hands the bottle of acid to the Doctor.) 
SELRIS: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Look out! 
SELRIS: No! 
(The Krotons kill Selris.) 
KROTON: Set the intergalactic link. 
KROTON 2: Take off, phase two. 
KROTON: Prepare to transfer. 
KROTON 2: All systems set. 
(A console with a flashing globe rises up and the Doctor looks at it.) 
KROTON: You will assist us now. 
DOCTOR: Assist you? In what way? 
KROTON 2: The Dynatrope will exhaust in twelve minutes. 
ZOE: Well that's your problem. 
DOCTOR: No, no, Zoe. If this machine does run down, there will be the most colossal release of energy. Enough to destroy us, the Krotons and most of the planet. If you want us to help you, you must explain what you want us to do. What is this thing? 
KROTON: It transfers the Dynatrope back to our own cosmos. It operates through mental power. 
DOCTOR: You've discovered a way of using mental power? 
ZOE: And you Krotons haven't enough. 
KROTON: Four high brains are needed in relay. There are only two of us. 
ZOE: Then how did you get here? 
KROTON: No more questions! 
DOCTOR: If you want us to cooperate, you must expect questions. 
KROTON: Unless you do as we order, you will be dispersed. 
DOCTOR: Very well. But that won't help you, will it. 
KROTON: We're wasting time. The Dynatrope was part of a battle fleet. Two of our crew were exhausted by enemy fire. 
ZOE: You mean they were killed? 
KROTON: Ceased to function. We carried out the emergency procedure and landed on the nearest planet. To conserve power we set the Dynatrope in perpetual stability. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. And you set the machine's systems to educate the Gonds up to the standard you require. 
(Behind his back, the Doctor passes the bottle to Zoe.) 
KROTON: Yes. They were primitives. 
ZOE: Well, you didn't have to kill them to do that. 
KROTON: Gond samples were brought in for testing at intervals. The Dynatrope absorbed their mental power into its circuits. The waste matter was rejected. 
KROTON 2: And dispersed. Nine minutes to exhaust time, Commander.

[Learning Hall]

(Beta and Jamie carry a large urn down the stairs as guards rush up.) 
BETA: Look out! 
JAMIE: Hey now, careful. Hey, watch it! 
BETA: Watch it. 
AXUS: Where do you think you're going? What's that? 
BETA: It's something called acid. The Doctor asked me to make it for him. 
AXUS: He won't be needing that now. You've been wasting your time. 
JAMIE: Where is he then? 
AXUS: He's joined the Krotons. 
BETA: You mean he's gone into the machine? 
JAMIE: Well, what about Zoe? 
VANA: Zoe too. The Krotons wanted them, and Eelek surrendered them. 
JAMIE: You did what? 
EELEK: The Krotons need your friends to enable them to leave our world. 
JAMIE: And you just handed them over, did you? 
EELEK: If the Krotons will leave our world, they're welcome to your friends. 
JAMIE: You miserable 
BETA: Careful, Jamie. 
EELEK: It's time we were leaving. 
JAMIE: Leaving? 
EELEK: Unless you want to die. 
BETA: What are you talking about, Eelek? 
EELEK: Beta, for a scientist, you're very stupid. This Learning Hall and most of our city is built around that Kroton's machine, and once that machine starts moving off 
BETA: The whole place will come down. 
EELEK: Exactly. And you'll be buried alive. 
JAMIE: Aye, well, I'm staying. Somehow I'm going to get the Doctor and Zoe out of there. Beta? 
BETA: Yes, I'll stay and help you. 
JAMIE: Good. 
EELEK: Vana? 
VANA: I'll stay and look after Thara. I'm not sensible enough to run away and leave my friends. 
EELEK: No. Let them stay, and let them die. 
(Eelek and his guards leave.) 
BETA: He could be right. you know. 
JAMIE: Aye, maybe so. But I'm not going down without a fight. Now where do we put this stuff?

[Dynatrope control]

KROTON: Put on the head sets. 
DOCTOR: Now, just a moment. If we're going to help you transfer the Dynatrope back to your own planet, what's going to happen to us? 
KROTON: You will suffer no harm. 
DOCTOR: Well, how can we be sure of that? We die without oxygen, you see, just as you would die if anyone was to upset the stuff you're drawing from that tank. 
KROTON: Take up your positions. 
DOCTOR: I was merely trying to explain that if anyone was to contaminate what was in that tank, you'd know what it was like to breathe poisoned air. 
KROTON: Six minutes. 
(Zoe tips the contents of the bottle into the bubbling tank behind her.) 
KROTON: You have no choice. Put on the head set. 
DOCTOR: Oh well, I suppose we'd better just take your word for it then. 
KROTON: Set the transfer link. 
KROTON: Final phase on automatic. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Now then, where do you want us to stand? 
KROTON: Unimportant. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, I'll stand over here then. 
ZOE: Oh. Oh Doctor, I wanted to stand there. 
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear. Oh well, you stand there and I'll stand here. Better still. A much better idea. I'll stand here and you stand over there. 
KROTON: Put on the head sets or you will be dispersed! 
DOCTOR: All right, all right. How do you wear these things? 
(The Doctor puts his on from front to back.) 
ZOE: (sotto) Nothing seems to be happening. 
DOCTOR: (sotto) Give it time. 
(The Doctor makes his head set fall off.) 
DOCTOR: Oh! Butterfingers! 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, you are clumsy. 
KROTON: Enough of this. Put on the head sets. 
DOCTOR: Well, it's your fault. You're making me nervous. 
(They put on the headsets and then the Krotons start burbling and falling over.) 
KROTON: What's happening? 
DOCTOR: Down, Zoe! 
(Kroton 2 falls on its back and its gas weapon discharges.) 
DOCTOR: Are you all right, Zoe? 
ZOE: Yes. Doctor, look, it's dissolving. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, it's returning to its basic form. 
ZOE: Oh, Doctor, these fumes, they're choking. 
DOCTOR: Yes, we must get out of here. Look, Zoe. The machine is melting. Come on, let's get out of here before we're trapped.

[Learning Hall]

(Jamie and Beta have found help and are pouring their urns of acid. The Doctor and Zoe run out of the machine.) 
JAMIE: Doctor! Zoe! 
BETA: What happened? 
JAMIE: Did you get on all right? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
JAMIE: How are you? 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'm a little bit shaken, but not half so bad as the Krotons, I can assure you. What're you doing here? 
THARA: Look at the machine! 
VANA: It's working, Thara! Look, it's working. 
ZOE: What made you think of pouring acid on it? 
BETA: Well, we reckoned if the Doctor thought it worthwhile experimenting with a few drops, we'd see what a few gallons would do. 
DOCTOR: Well done! 
ZOE: But how did you know the machine would dissolve? 
DOCTOR: Hmm? Well, the machine was eighty percent tellurium, Zoe, and tellurium is soluble in sulphuric acid. 
ZOE: But the machine wasn't pure tellurium. 
DOCTOR: No, well, the acid wasn't pure sulphuric acid, but it worked didn't it? Come along. Let's get away. I don't like goodbyes. 
(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie sneak up the stairs.) 
VANA: It's finished now, isn't it? 
THARA: Yes, it is finished. The end of the Krotons. Free at last! 
VANA: We still have Eelek to deal with. 
THARA: That will be my pleasure. I shall take over from my father as leader of the Gonds, whatever Eelek thinks. 
BETA: And we can develop our own science. The Doctor can help. Doctor? 
THARA: They've gone. 
BETA: But I wanted to ask his advice. There's so much to be done. 
THARA: We'll have to find our own answers now, Beta. 
(At the base of the cliff in the wastelands, the Tardis dematerialises.)

Stockholm Washington personnel transportation. Stockholm sending now. Washington receiving now. Dispatch completed. Non-arrival shipment of synthetic protein New York to Moscow. Moonbase clearance awaited. 
KELLY: Brent? 
BRENT: Yes, Miss Kelly? 
KELLY: Why is there a delay at Moon Control? 
BRENT: There's some mix up with the Moscow shipment. It seems to have landed up in Canberra. 
KELLY: Fewsham again, I suppose? Take Moscow out of phase while they sort it out. 
BRENT: Moscow pending. Moonbase clear. 
COMPUTER: Toronto Calcutta shipment activated. Toronto sending now. Calcutta receiving now. Dispatch completed.

BRENT: Canberra Moscow, go ahead please. 
COMPUTER: Canberra sending now. Moscow receiving now. Dispatch completed. 
(A man beams into a teleport cubicle and there is a chime. He strides across the floor swinging his briefcase.) 
OSGOOD: Good morning, Gia. 
KELLY: Morning. Just as well you've arrived. 
OSGOOD: Why, what's up? 
KELLY: The sooner you take over from Fewsham on Moon Control, the better. 
OSGOOD: Oh, not again! 
KELLY: All T-Mat consignments are five minutes behind schedule. 
OSGOOD: What? 
KELLY: Fewsham routed a large Moscow consignment through to Canberra. 
OSGOOD: Oh, he's a lunatic. 
KELLY: You should never have recommended him for an Assistant Controller's job in the first place. 
OSGOOD: Yes, I know now, but I thought he deserved a break. 
KELLY: Sentimental. He'll do something really disastrous one day and you'll have to answer for it. 
OSGOOD: So, I'll go and work in a synthetics factory. 
KELLY: It's your career. 
OSGOOD: So it is. Hey, have you got a T-Mat cubicle ready for me? 
KELLY: Yes. Number six. 
OSGOOD: See you later. 
(Osgood steps into another cubicle.) 
KELLY: Prepare lunar cubicle number six for transport to Moon Control. 
BRENT: Ready and waiting. 
(Osgood blows Kelly a kiss.) 
KELLY: Activate. 
(Osgood vanishes.) 
BRENT: It's lucky he got here before your man arrived. 
KELLY: Yes, he's late. Keep a public T-Mat cubicle open for him. 
BRENT: Right. Local cubicle two holding open. 
KELLY: Report Moonbase situation please. 
COMPUTER: Moonbase clear. Routine shipments transferring on automatic control. Local arrival cubicle two activating. 
(A silver-haired man steps out.) 
RADNOR: Morning, Brent. 
BRENT: Morning, sir. 
RADNOR: Good morning, Gia. All functioning well? 
KELLY: Of course, Commander Radnor. 
RADNOR: In your case, Miss Kelly, efficiency and charm go hand in hand. 
KELLY: I try to keep things running smoothly. 
RADNOR: Nothing ever goes wrong while you're on duty. 
KELLY: I don't allow it. 
(Radnor goes into his office.)

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

OSGOOD: You may have been on duty all night, Fewsham, but that's no excuse for this kind of slip-up! 
FEWSHAM: They weren't a major hold ups, just a few minutes. 
OSGOOD: Kelly was going mad back on Earth Control. 
FEWSHAM: She would. 
OSGOOD: Look, I'm sorry, Fewsham, but it's my head in the noose as well, you know. 
FEWSHAM: I know, I'm sorry. 
OSGOOD: Oh, all right. All right, go on. You'd better get back to Earth. 
(Fewsham goes to a cubicle, but an alarm sounds.) 
OSGOOD: Now what? 
FEWSHAM: The outer door airlocks. 
OSGOOD: Who's there? 
FEWSHAM: No one. 
OSGOOD: Then how come the airlocks are in use? 
(A man screams just outside the control room. Osgood and Fewsham open the doors and he falls into their arms.) 
OSGOOD: Phipps! What is it, man? What's happened? Come on, man! 
(Another scream and two more men run in.) 
LOCKE: Close the doors, we've got to keep 
(But what is in the corridor makes them freeze in fear.) 
OSGOOD: Don't move, anybody. Don't do anything. Harvey, don't! 
(The light of a weapon kills Harvey.)

[T-Mat Earth Control]

(The Delay light is blinking.) 
BRENT: Not again. 
KELLY: The second Moscow consignment? 
BRENT: Yes. They'll think we're deliberately sabotaging their stuff if this goes on. 
KELLY: T-Mat reception, Earth to Moon. Controller Kelly calling. Switch your communication links to video. 
(The video screen is blank.) 
KELLY: Osgood's gone too far this time. There'll be trouble. 
[T Mat Moonbase Control]

OSGOOD: No! I refuse! 
(The unseen visitor speaks with a harsh, hissing voice.) 
SLAAR: You would be wise to co-operate at once, otherwise you will be destroyed. 
OSGOOD: Well I, I suppose that leaves me no alternative. 
PHIPPS: Don't do it, sir. 
SLAAR: Silence. 
OSGOOD: There's a certain element of risk. 
SLAAR: You are wasting time. 
(Osgood operates some switches under the video screen. Smoke starts pouring out of the sides.) 
SLAAR: What is happening? 
OSGOOD: I'm afraid there has been a fault. The circuit's overloaded. Very unfortunate. 
SLAAR: You have deliberately sabotaged this apparatus. Kill him. 
(Osgood turns and gets shot with the alien weapon.)

[T Mat Earth Control]

RADNOR: I thought the system was infallible? 
KELLY: It won't be anything serious. 
RADNOR: I'm glad you think so. 
KELLY: Brent, is there any obvious damage? 
BRENT: No damage reported. All links stable. 
RADNOR: That's only local, surely. 
KELLY: It's only one stage of the checking process. Report on Intercity T-Mat breakdown. 
COMPUTER: Complete power phase blank. 
KELLY: State of materialisation pulse generator? 
COMPUTER: Overloaded in power surge. No damage this end. 
KELLY: Check with Moonbase. 
COMPUTER: Primary video link dead. 
KELLY: Cause? 
COMPUTER: Being investigated. 
RADNOR: Are you sure it isn't serious? 
KELLY: My staff are running a thorough and immediate check. Until I have their report, I can't answer. 
RADNOR: Then they'd better hurry. I want that report. Soon.

[Tardis]

(The Tardis is making materialisation sounds.) 
ZOE: Doctor, if we've landed, where are we? 
DOCTOR: That is what I'm trying to find out, Zoe. 
(The scanner picks up - ) 
ZOE: A rocket? 
JAMIE: Hey, we're just hanging in space. 
DOCTOR: We can't be. 
ZOE: Well, let's try and find a star we know. 
(The scanner image swings round to a CCCP space suit.) 
DOCTOR: Ah there we are. What in heavens name? 
JAMIE: Hey, what's he up to? 
ZOE: He's trying to climb aboard. 
DOCTOR: Just a minute, just a minute. Oh this control is. There we are. Now that, that's an ion-jet rocket of the twenty first century, but, this helmet, if I can. There we are. That's not nearly so sophisticated. It's certainly not later than 1960. 
JAMIE: Well, those letters on his helmet? 
ZOE: C C C P. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
DOCTOR: Of course! 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: Just a minute. 
(The Doctor gets the scanner to turn in the opposite direction, and reveals an old document with backwards writing on it.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think that explains it. 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, what is it? 
DOCTOR: Hmm? Well it's a flying machine, designed by a gentleman by the name of Leonardo Da Vinci in about 1500. 
JAMIE: Well, what's it doing up here? 
ZOE: Doctor, where are we? 
JAMIE: Aye. 
DOCTOR: We're in a museum! 
JAMIE: A what? 
DOCTOR: A space museum! Look, there you are. 
(Wright Brothers airplane, capsule with an astronaut taking a tethered space walk, Montgolfier's balloon) 
DOCTOR: A balloon. 
(A Spitfire, a HOTOL style American Airlines plane.) 
DOCTOR: That's a transport plane. And, now those initials, they stand for Russia. That's Gagarin, the first Earthman in space. Look. 
(A rocket launch, TravelMat Relay over an image of the Moon.) 
DOCTOR: Come on. Let's have a look round, shall we? 
(Jamie and Zoe Leave the Tardis. The Doctor turns back for his jacket.) 
DOCTOR: Just a minute. Wait for me.

[Space museum]

(Exhibits include the Astral map from the Web Planet.) 
JAMIE: Hey, quite a place, isn't it? 
DOCTOR: Oh, my word. 
JAMIE: Hey, look at the size of this one, Doc. 
DOCTOR: Yes. My word, Jamie, look at that. 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, look! 
DOCTOR: Very large. 
ZOE: Doctor, look. 
(The rocket model they first saw on the scanner. 
JAMIE: Hey, look at that. 
(Zoe presses a button on a panel.) 
DOCTOR: Now, Zoe. 
(There is a chime.) 
JAMIE: What's that? 
(A screen drops down on the wall behind them, and an information video plays.) 
MAN [OC]: Travel Mat is the ultimate form of travel. Control centre of the present system is the Moon, serving receptions at all major cities on the Earth. Travel Mat provides an instantaneous means of public travel, transports raw materials and vital food supplies to all parts of the world. 
JAMIE: Travel Mat? It sounds like a flying carpet. 
DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie, I'm trying to listen. 
MAN [OC]: Travel Mat supersedes all conventional forms of transport. Using the principle of dematerialisation at the point of departure, and rematerialisation at the point of arrival in special cubicles, departure and arrival are almost instantaneous. 
ZOE: Faster than light. 
MAN [OC]: Although the system is still in its early stages, it completely automated and foolproof against power failure. 
JAMIE: Aye, well, we have our own system, thank you, only it isn't foolproof. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, I think that's just a tiny bit 
(The Doctor turns and raises his hands in surrender to the weapon pointed at him. Jamie and Zoe do likewise.)

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

SLAAR: You saw what happened to your superior. You would do well to co-operate. 
FEWSHAM: Killing him didn't do you any good. 
SLAAR: But you will do as I ask. 
FEWSHAM: There is nothing I can do! 
SLAAR: You do not want to die? 
FEWSHAM: Look, I'm not that good enough a technician. It needs an expert. 
SLAAR: But you are second in command here. 
FEWSHAM: Yes, but 
SLAAR: Then you must have certain abilities. You must know what needs to be done. 
FEWSHAM: In theory, yes. 
SLAAR: Then you will do it. 
PHIPPS: He'll only make it worse. 
SLAAR: What is their status here? 
FEWSHAM: Maintenance. Second class technicians. 
LOCKE: There's only one person who can really put things to rights, and she's at Earth Control. 
PHIPPS: Without her, it just can't be done. 
SLAAR: Who is this specialist? 
FEWSHAM: Miss Kelly, technical coordinator. But there's no way to reach her. T-Mat is not working. 
SLAAR: But you have a video link. 
FEWSHAM: Yes, but Osgood wrecked that too. 
SLAAR: So, there is no means to communicate with Earth? 
PHIPPS: No, you've cut us off completely. 
SLAAR: In that case, you are useless. You will all be destroyed. 
FEWSHAM: No, there's the emergency T-Mat link! It only operates from here to Earth. 
SLAAR: Then you will activate the apparatus. At once. 
(Fewsham hurries to the controls.) 
FEWSHAM: It's damaged, too! 
SLAAR: These technicians will help you repair it. 
PHIPPS: We won't help you. Neither will he. 
SLAAR: Then he will die. You will start work at once. There will be a guard at the door. When I return you will have the T-mat link ready for operation. 
(Slaar, who we have not yet seen, leaves.) 
PHIPPS: Don't be such a fool, Fewsham. If we repair the emergency link these creatures can travel to Earth! 
FEWSHAM: What about us? 
PHIPPS: Do you think that will make any difference in the end? As soon as he gets what he wants out of us, we'll mean nothing to him. 
FEWSHAM: If we co-operate there's still a chance. 
PHIPPS: Osgood didn't take it. 
FEWSHAM: You saw! Do you think I want to die like that? I want to live!

[T Mat Earth Control]

KELLY: Brent, is there anything at all, any trace of a reason? 
BRENT: Every link has been double-checked. This end is functioning normally. 
KELLY: Then it must be Moonbase. 
BRENT: We've no way of checking their apparatus from this end, and they don't answer our call. 
KELLY: Where's Commander Radnor? 
BRENT: Not back from the Intercity Council meeting yet. 
KELLY: He'll expect a full report. 
BRENT: Well, there it is. We've even checked the computer. 
(Brent gives Kelly a piece of paper and leaves.) 
RADNOR: Have you located the cause of the breakdown? 
KELLY: This end is absolutely clear. 
RADNOR: That isn't what I want to know. 
KELLY: We cannot trace the fault. 
RADNOR: Miss Kelly! I have senior government officials hounding me. They expect a more informative answer, and so do I. 
KELLY: There isn't one. The trouble is at Moonbase. 
RADNOR: Why can't you deal with it? 
KELLY: We can't get there. 
BRENT: We can't even talk to them. 
RADNOR: Do you mean to tell me that there's no other way of contacting them? 
BRENT: No. 
KELLY: Only by rocket. 
RADNOR: That could be our only answer. 
BRENT: But the only place you'll find a rocket is in a museum. 
RADNOR: Exactly. 
KELLY: And even if there was one that could be made operational, there's no-one that could control such a project. 
RADNOR: You're wrong. There is just one man, one man alone who can help us now.

[Space museum]

(The weapon is held by an elderly man with a quilted body-warmer over his clothes.) 
ELDRED: For the last time, who are you and what are you doing in my private workshop? 
DOCTOR: Now just listen, there really is no need for all these histrionics. We are perfectly harmless. 
ELDRED: How did you even get in here? 
DOCTOR: Oh well, the usual way. We just materialised. 
ELDRED: The T-Mat cubicle always gives automatic warnings, but it didn't this time. 
ZOE: Well that's not our fault, is it? 
ELDRED: Why did you come? 
DOCTOR: Well, this is a museum. 
ELDRED: The museum is (sees the Tardis) What on Earth's that? It's a twentieth century Police Box, isn't it? 
DOCTOR: Well, yes, in a way. 
ELDRED: Well, how did a thing like that get in my museum? 
ZOE: Oh, well you could say it was a form of space ship. 
DOCTOR: Zoe, I think we do owe this gentleman an apology. We really are most interested in the museum, Mister? 
ELDRED: Eldred, Professor Eldred. Look, the museum is closed to the general public. You've obviously made a mistake. Perhaps you'd be good enough to leave. 
JAMIE: Are you in charge of this place? 
ELDRED: I own it. That is why I have the right to ask you to leave. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but there's no need to threaten us, you know. 
ELDRED: Trespassers are not welcome. Will you please go! 
ZOE: We're not trespassers. We're very interested. 
ELDRED: Interested? In Professor Eldred and his antiquated machines? Come for a good laugh, I suppose, like the rest of them. 
DOCTOR: Laugh? You mean people laugh at all this? Why, it's a magnificent exhibition. 
ELDRED: We've had enough souvenir hunters, too! 
JAMIE: Now, we're not thieves, you know. 
DOCTOR: No, of course not. We haven't come to take anything. We genuinely are interested in space travel. Why, especially a thing like this. This is superb. 
ELDRED: Yes, magnificent. It was to have been the vehicle to take man beyond the moon. T-Mat put an end to all that. 
DOCTOR: You mean this model's been abandoned? But it's speed and stability concept alone, it's a tremendous advance in rocket design. 
ELDRED: Exactly! Exactly! Here, let me show it to you. Let me show it to you. 
(Eldred puts down his gun and helps the Doctor with the ion jet rocket model.) 
DOCTOR: I'll give you an hand, here we are. Oh yes, this is superb. My word. 
ELDRED: And the secret, the real breakthrough, was a compact generator of enormous power. 
DOCTOR: I see. And these must be the secondary electrode accelerators. 
ELDRED: Yes. You see it beat the problem of the neutral caesium ions. And incidentally, it magnified the g-thrust to fantastic proportions! 
DOCTOR: That was awkward. What did you do about that? 
ELDRED: Well, I'll show you. Come with me, I'll show you. Look. 
(Eldred and the Doctor go to the back of the room.) 
DOCTOR: What have we go here? Ah, blueprints! 
JAMIE: Look at them, like a couple of kids. 
ZOE: Yes. You can tell he's almost in love with that rocket. 
JAMIE: Shush! 
ELDRED: That's not surprising. I designed it. I've been in rocketry all my life. My father engineered the first lunar passenger module, and I travelled on the last trip back to Earth. Before it all finished. 
ZOE: Before all what finished? 
ELDRED: Space travel. 
ZOE: But if the rocket was so good, why did you stop at the moon? 
JAMIE: Aye, why end there? 
ELDRED: Because of T-Mat. T-Mat, the ultimate in travel. With about as much sense of adventure as a synthetic carbohydrates factory. 
DOCTOR: But surely rockets would still be useful as an auxiliary means of transport, wouldn't they? Besides, how would man get beyond the moon? 
ELDRED: Nobody cares any more about exploring space. Life made. Well, it was made too easy by T-Mat. 
DOCTOR: I see. So you lost government backing? 
ELDRED: The project was abandoned, except by me.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

FEWSHAM: You've got to help me. If we don't repair it, we'll all be killed. 
LOCKE: Maybe we could repair it and T-Mat back to London. 
FEWSHAM: With that thing guarding the door? I'm going to keep on trying. 
LOCKE: Maybe there is something we can do. 
PHIPPS: What? 
FEWSHAM: I knew you'd see reason. 
(Locke goes to the panel Osgood sabotaged.) 
FEWSHAM: What are you doing? 
LOCKE: The video link with Earth. Yes, it's not so badly damaged as the T-Mat. 
FEWSHAM: We were told to repair the T-Mat link, not the video. 
PHIPPS: Let's have a look. If we can't escape ourselves, maybe we can get a message through by video. 
FEWSHAM: Look, the guard will see what we're doing. He'll kill us! 
LOCKE: You play your game, we'll play ours.

[Space museum]

ELDRED: No more money, no more facilities. A life's work abandoned just like that. All because of T-Mat. 
DOCTOR: Well, I can understand your bitterness. Very short-sighted of the government to put all their eggs in one basket. 
ELDRED: You still haven't told me who you are and what you're doing here. 
(Beep!) 
DOCTOR: Well. 
ELDRED: That's the main-door alarm! What's going on? 
(Radnor and Kelly enter.) 
RADNOR: Professor Daniel Eldred. Well, well, well. 
ELDRED: Radnor. Come to see how your spies are getting on? 
RADNOR: I'm sorry? I don't think we've met. My name's Radnor. This is Miss Kelly. 
DOCTOR: Oh, how do you do. This is Zoe, and Jamie, and I'm the Doctor. 
ZOE: Hello. 
JAMIE: Hello. 
ELDRED: Oh, Radnor, don't pretend that you don't know them. 
RADNOR: I can assure you I've never met them before in my life. 
ELDRED: I see. I find three strangers prowling around my museum, and by the merest co-incidence you turn up on their very heels. 
RADNOR: I can assure you I merely wanted a chat with a very old friend. 
ELDRED: Why? You've done without a chat for a good many years. 
RADNOR: Old times. Friendships don't die. 
ELDRED: Our friendship ended the day that you walked out of my laboratory and joined the government administration on T-Mat! 
RADNOR: Different men, different careers, Daniel. 
ELDRED: Yes, but you happened to know which career was going to be financed by government funds. 
RADNOR: But you could have come over with me. We asked you to join us. 
ELDRED: Yes, and worked as Miss Kelly's assistant perhaps? 
KELLY: You know I respect your work, Professor Eldred. We would have welcomed you on T-Mat. 
ELDRED: I prefer rockets, obsolete as they are. 
RADNOR: Not so obsolete as all that, Daniel, eh? 
ELDRED: What? 
RADNOR: We don't miss very much, you know. 
ELDRED: So you've been spying on me. 
RADNOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. We stopped that a long time ago. 
ELDRED: I should think so. What's wrong with running a private museum? 
RADNOR: Nothing, but you're doing rather more than that, aren't you, Daniel. 
ELDRED: All right, what if I am? It's a free country, isn't it? What's wrong with having a hobby? 
RADNOR: Rather more than a hobby, preparing an ion rocket for an unauthorised journey into space. 
ELDRED: All right, so you know. What do you intend to do? 
RADNOR: My dear fellow, help you, of course. 
ELDRED: What? 
RADNOR: You can make your trip with full government backing, as long as it's to the moon. 
ELDRED: Why the moon? 
KELLY: There's a minor fault developed at T-Mat control at Moonbase. 
RADNOR: And we have to put it right, quickly. 
ELDRED: I thought T-Mat was infallible. 
KELLY: It will be, eventually, however we have no way of reaching the moon. 
ELDRED: Except by out of date rocket. Oh, that's perfect! So you need me after all. 
RADNOR: I thought you'd be taken with the idea, Daniel. And a large sum of government funds wouldn't come amiss, would they? Now, how soon can you be ready to (pause) blast off. Well, come on, it's urgent! Can you give me an approximate ETD? 
ELDRED: I could. 
RADNOR: Good! 
ELDRED: But I won't! 
RADNOR: Why? There are no strings. 
ELDRED: I don't have to give you reasons. I'm just telling you that I refuse.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

PHIPPS: Right, that should do it. 
LOCKE: I'll switch on the power. 
FEWSHAM: You fools. When they find out, we'll all be killed. 
LOCKE: Moonbase to T-Mat Reception Earth. Moonbase to Earth. Emergency. Emergency.

[Space museum]

RADNOR: You can't refuse, man. There's more at stake here than an out of date rocket programme. 
COMPUTER: Commander Radnor. 
RADNOR: Excuse me. Radnor. 
COMPUTER: Emergency message from Moonbase linking through now. 
LOCKE [on monitor]: Commander Radnor, Miss Kelly. We are in desperate trouble. Osgood is dead and we're 
(Transmission ends.) 
RADNOR: Locke! Locke!

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

(A green claw rips the video link to pieces. The biped wears a helmet with large glass pieces in front of its eyes. Its skin is scaly.) 
SLAAR: Guard! 
(Enter an Ice Warrior.) 
SLAAR: Kill him! 
(The Warrior obeys.)

Episode Two

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

(Phipps runs for the door.) 
SLAAR: Stop him. 
(The Warrior fires too late. Phipps is off down the corridor.) 
SLAAR: Hunt that man. He must not escape. 
(The Warrior leaves.) 
SLAAR: You allowed them to send a message back to Earth. 
FEWSHAM: They tricked me! I tried to stop them. 
SLAAR: No matter. He will be found and killed. 
FEWSHAM: What about me? 
SLAAR: Have you repaired the emergency T-Mat link? 
FEWSHAM: Not yet. It isn't easy. 
SLAAR: But it is possible? 
FEWSHAM: Yes, only give me time. 
SLAAR: Very well, but now you know what will happen if you fail. You will die.

[Space museum]

RADNOR: Daniel, don't you see this goes far beyond a petty quarrel over rockets and T-Mat! Those men at Moonbase are in serious trouble and we must help them. 
ELDRED: You'll have to find some other way. 
KELLY: With T-Mat dead there is no other way. Your rocket is our only hope of reaching the moon. 
DOCTOR: Professor, listen to them. 
ELDRED: I'm listening. 
DOCTOR: In a way this is a triumph for your rocket. 
ELDRED: Is it? 
RADNOR: Of course it is. The government recognises the fact. 
ELDRED: Then the government is going to be disappointed. 
RADNOR: I don't understand you. 
ELDRED: Oh, I'd better be frank with you. 
RADNOR: Yes, I think you'd better. 
ELDRED: I must admit I played with the idea of making a space flight. I even prepared a rocket. 
KELLY: Well then? 
ELDRED: It was just a dream, an illusion for a disappointed man. 
KELLY: You mean there's nothing? 
ELDRED: Oh, the rocket's there, partially prepared. 
RADNOR: Good! 
ELDRED: As for an actual lift off 
RADNOR: We can do it, Daniel. I know we can. 
ELDRED: It takes more than enthusiasm to get a rocket off the ground. 
RADNOR: You've only to ask for what you want. Funds, men, equipment. 
ELDRED: It needs the one thing that you have not got. Time. 
KELLY: A crash programme with the best available technicians. 
ELDRED: It's nowhere near ready, woman! Most of the equipment is still unchecked. 
RADNOR: A computer can be programmed for that. 
ELDRED: It would still be impossibly dangerous. 
RADNOR: Daniel, it was you who created this rocket. It was your driving force and enthusiasm that got it off the drawing board. With you in control, we can't fail to succeed. 
ELDRED: That was a long time past. Now my heart couldn't take the strain of the G-force. 
KELLY: That doesn't mean your experience and knowledge are useless. We need your guidance. 
ELDRED: No. I told you it's a dream. I can never go to the moon and neither can rocket ZA685. 
JAMIE: Could we not help them? We could use the Tardis. 
ZOE: What, for a trip to the moon? 
JAMIE: Aye. 
ZOE: We'd probably overshoot by a few million years. 
DOCTOR: Yes, or by a few million miles. I'm afraid the Tardis is not suited to short-range travel. 
ZOE: Still, I think we should help them if we can. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
DOCTOR: Yes. I think I could get your rocket to the moon. 
ELDRED: You? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I have considerable experience in space travel, and so have my two companions. 
RADNOR: Doctor, that's splendid. Thank you. 
ELDRED: But the rocket is not ready! 
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps you're overestimating the difficulties. How much more work is required on your rocket? 
ELDRED: It needs fuelling, and a complete computerised check-up. 
RADNOR: Well, I can order that. 
ELDRED: No! I will not allow it! The risk is too great. No! 
RADNOR: If there was some other way, believe me I wouldn't even consider such a risk. 
ELDRED: No! 
KELLY: There's always the outside chance that the fault in T-Mat will clear itself. 
COMPUTER: Commander Radnor. Urgent. 
RADNOR: Excuse me. 
RADNOR: Radnor. Go ahead. 
COMPUTER: T-Mat receptions New York, Moscow, Tokyo express great concern over continued hold-up. Medical shipments and food supplies awaiting transit to Asiatic centres. Position desperate, Calcutta. Instructions awaited. 
RADNOR: That's your answer. 
DOCTOR: Well, we're willing to help, as I've said. 
ELDRED: You don't know what you're doing. It's suicide. 
RADNOR: Listen, if this fault lasts much longer, there's going to be worldwide chaos, and world population is at stake. 
ELDRED: Infallible T-Mat putting the world in jeopardy? 
RADNOR: All right, I admit it. 
ELDRED: And now you want this man to risk his life to get you out of trouble. 
RADNOR: No, not me, but thousands of people all over the world who will die if we don't take this risk. I'm sorry, but I've got no alternative. Miss Kelly? 
KELLY: Sir? 
RADNOR: I want all technical personnel working on this. I want that rocket prepared for launching. 
KELLY: Yes, Commander. 
(Kelly leaves.) 
RADNOR: We'd be grateful for your help. 
ELDRED: If that rocket is going to reach the moon safely, you'll need more than help. You'll need a miracle.

[Moonbase corridor]

(The Ice Warrior meets up with another at the junction.) 
WARRIOR: Continue the search. He must not escape. 
(Phipps is hiding behind machinery in the Solar Energy Store Room. A Warrior enters, looks around, fails to see him and leaves. When the corridor is clear again, Phipps closes the door and takes a Solar Amplifier out of its box.)

[Space museum]

(Everyone is writing on clipboards.) 
KELLY: Commander? 
RADNOR: Yes, Miss Kelly? 
KELLY: Do you think it's wise letting these people crew the rocket? 
RADNOR: Wise? No, of course it's not wise, but what's the alternative? We gave up training astronauts years ago. 
KELLY: But who are they? 
RADNOR: Some of Eldred's crazy friends, I imagine. But the man who calls himself the Doctor certainly knows his space travel. 
KELLY: How can you be sure? 
RADNOR: Well, you wanted the briefing, but he and the girl know more about space flight than Eldred. 
KELLY: What about the boy? 
RADNOR: Yes, I'm not sure about him. Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes? 
RADNOR: Tell me, are all three of you planning to crew this rocket? 
JAMIE: Oh aye. I can be useful too, you know. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, I hadn't thought about you. 
JAMIE: Hey, you're not leaving me behind and that's final. 
ELDRED: There can be no excess weight on this trip. 
JAMIE: Well, how much many this rocket thing hold? 
ELDRED: Well it was designed for a three man crew. 
JAMIE: Ah. Well then, I'm going. 
KELLY: Commander? 
RADNOR: Yes, Miss. 
KELLY: The chemical fuel reserve stocks at launching site are barely adequate for a moon journey and return. 
RADNOR: What about other sources of supply? 
KELLY: New York and Moscow. Transit impossible due to T-Mat malfunction. 
DOCTOR: But surely it's only a question of getting to the moon. We shall come back by T-Mat, won't we? 
RADNOR: Possibly. Depends what's wrong with it. 
ELDRED: There is another source of supply. 
RADNOR: Oh, what's that? 
ELDRED: The fuel dump on the moon. There's a refuelling system connected to the landing bay. 
RADNOR: But surely that equipment hasn't been used for years. 
ELDRED: Neither has the radio homing beam, and if that doesn't work you'll never make a landing at all. 
JAMIE: Oh, in that case we needn't worry about getting back. 
ELDRED: Well, all the equipment has been completely automated and solar powered. Designed all myself. No reason why it shouldn't work. 
DOCTOR: I'm sure it will. 
ELDRED: Are you sure you remember all that I told you at the briefing? 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, and even if I don't, Zoe has total recall. 
ELDRED: Well, just in case, I've written it all down here. 
DOCTOR: There's no need, we. 
ELDRED: And there's a map of Moonbase, too. Now, you know how to operate the homing beam? 
DOCTOR: Now don't worry about a thing. Your rocket is going to be in good hands. 
JAMIE: Ahem. 
DOCTOR: That's quite enough, Jamie. 
ELDRED: And remember you've only got enough food and water for three days. 
DOCTOR: Yes, well we've taken (conversation carries on in background) 
KELLY: Commander? 
RADNOR: Yes, Miss Kelly? 
KELLY: I think I should go as crew on the rocket. 
RADNOR: Don't be ridiculous. You're too valuable here. 
KELLY: But how can T-Mat be repaired if I'm not there? 
RADNOR: Well, what about the other technicians already there? 
KELLY: Osgood's dead. 
RADNOR: Yes, well, what about Fewsham? Phipps? 
KELLY: Oh, he's incapable of repairing it. I think I should go. 
RADNOR: No! You're the only one who really understands T-Mat. I can't have you risking your life. 
KELLY: And yet you're perfectly prepared to allow them to risk theirs. 
DOCTOR: Now don't worry, Miss Kelly. We're going to be perfectly all right. 
KELLY: But how can you be sure? You don't even know what the trouble is up there.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

(Fewsham is still working on the control panel. Two Warriors stand guard.) 
SLAAR: The emergency link with Earth, is it ready yet? 
FEWSHAM: I've nearly finished. 
SLAAR: Do not make any mistakes. 
FEWSHAM: I am not an expert. 
SLAAR: But you will do it. 
FEWSHAM: Yes! But I don't see what good just this emergency link can be. Even if you had a gigantic army of warriors, you couldn't send them all to conquer Earth. 
SLAAR: We do not need an army. Earth will be ours for the taking, very soon. 
(In the Solar Energy Store Room, Phipps looks around for something, then finds an infra-red lamp. He plugs it into the Solar Amplifier then hunts for the Solar Power Line. It is hidden behind some old canisters.)

[Rocket]

ELDRED [on monitor]: Ignition reserve power. 
ZOE [OC]: Fully charged. 
KELLY [on monitor]: Internal atmosphere settings? 
DOCTOR [OC]: All normal. 
ELDRED [on monitor]: Trajectory bearings, orbital lock. 
ZOE [OC]: Pre-set registering normal functions.

[Mission control]

(A few tables and microphones in a room at the museum.) 
KELLY: Lift off activation check complete. All readings alpha green. 
RADNOR: Well done. In record time and not a thing wrong. 
ELDRED: So far. 
RADNOR: Doctor? 
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes? 
RADNOR: Final check on procedure after you land. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Oh yes, I know. We're to re-establish video link with the Earth. 
RADNOR: That's right. When we can see what's wrong, you can do the rest under Miss Kelly's supervision. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Right. We're ready when you are. 
KELLY: Link programme to telemeter guidance. KELLY: Three minutes. Countdown will begin at T minus sixty seconds. 
RADNOR: This is it. 
(ZA685 stands alone on its launch pad. No gantry, no feeder lines, nothing.) 
KELLY: All functions are on computer controlled pre-set. Clear launching site.

[Rocket]

(The crew capsule is suitably cramped.) 
ZOE: Three minutes seems an awfully long time. 
DOCTOR: Yes. You remember your take off briefing, Jamie? 
JAMIE: Aye, he's told me all about this G-force stuff. Now I know. 
ZOE: You don't know about it until you've experienced it. 
JAMIE: Look Zoe, I'll have you know that the Doctor and I have 
KELLY [OC]: T minus sixty seconds from now. 
DOCTOR: There's one minute to go. Now hold tight, everyone. 
ZOE: Well, I'm all right, Doctor. How about you, Jamie? 
JAMIE: (scared) Look, I keep telling you, I'm fine. 
KELLY [OC]: T minus fifty.

[Mission control]

ELDRED: Make sure telemeter guidance is operative! 
RADNOR: Don't worry, everything's been checked and rechecked. 
KELLY: T minus forty. Technicians report. 
BRENT [OC]: All areas clear. 
ELDRED: Check all systems. 
KELLY: We have. 
ELDRED: We must make sure. 
KELLY: T minus thirty. Twenty six.

[Rocket]

KELLY [OC]: Twenty two. Eighteen. Fourteen. Twelve. Ten.

[Mission control]

KELLY: Ten, nine, eight, Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. We have lift off. 
(Archive footage of a Saturn V heading for the stratosphere.) 
RADNOR: I never thought I'd see that again. A rocket rising in flight. 
ELDRED: Beautiful! Let's see how they are. The link is dead! 
KELLY: What? Something must have gone wrong on lift off. 
RADNOR: Try the shadow channel. 
KELLY: Nothing. 
RADNOR: Do you mean to say we're out of touch completely? 
ELDRED: What about radio link? 
KELLY: Earth control to rocket. How do you read me? Over. 
ELDRED: Nothing but static. 
RADNOR: It's only a minor fault, surely.

[Rocket]

(Weightless but still strapped into their seats.) 
KELLY [OC]: Earth control to rocket. How do you read me? Earth control to rocket. 
ZOE: Don't release your safety straps until I switch over to automatic gravity control, otherwise you'll float away. 
KELLY [OC]: Earth control to rocket, how do you read me? 
ZOE: Oh, wait a minute! Switching to automatic gravity control now.

[Mission control]

ELDRED: Try again. 
KELLY: Earth control to rocket. 
ZOE [OC]: Rocket to Earth Control. Wait a minute, can't you? We've only just recovered from take-off. 
ELDRED: Is everything all right? We seem to have lost our video monitor link. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes, I think there must be a fault in one of the circuits. 
ELDRED: Doctor? Doctor?

[Rocket]

(Smoke is coming from a panel.) 
ZOE: What is it? 
DOCTOR: Well, one of the circuits has burnt out, Zoe. I'll switch to a secondary one. 
JAMIE: Oh, no. This is worse than the Tardis.

[Mission control]

ELDRED: Do you read me, Doctor? 
KELLY: Sounds as though the entire communications circuitry has blown out. 
ELDRED: Yes, let's hope that's all that's happened. 
RADNOR: Keep trying, Miss Kelly.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

FEWSHAM: It's done. The emergency link will work now. 
SLAAR: Excellent! 
FEWSHAM: What are you going to do? 
SLAAR: Do not ask questions. Activate the link. On receive only. 
FEWSHAM: Receive? But aren't you going to send anybody 
SLAAR: Activate the link on receive at once!

[Mission control]

KELLY: And you've double checked everything? 
BRENT [on monitor]: Yes. The fault is definitely at Moonbase. 
RADNOR: Is it possible for you to effect repairs over video? 
KELLY: Provided the fault is not too major. 
ELDRED: And provided they actually get there in the rocket. 
RADNOR: They'll get there. 
ELDRED: Why? How do you know? You can't even be sure the rocket's still in one piece. 
BRENT [on monitor]: Miss Kelly! 
KELLY: What is it, Brent? 
BRENT [on monitor]: We've got through. The emergency T-Mat link to Moon Control is activating. 
KELLY: Is someone coming through? 
BRENT [on monitor]: No, it's on send. 
KELLY: Moonbase must have managed to make a temporary repair. 
RADNOR: It seems odd. 
KELLY: That's all we need. Brent, have a full emergency kit waiting. I'll join you as soon as possible. 
BRENT [on monitor]: Yes, Miss Kelly. Crew are standing by. 
RADNOR: Where do you think you're going? 
KELLY: Well, if we can send, it's the only thing I can do. 
RADNOR: You've no idea what conditions are like up there. 
KELLY: I know all too well what they're like down here. And it's my job to put things right. 
RADNOR: Miss Kelly! You cannot assume that responsibility without authorisation. 
KELLY: Commander, you've stopped me once. Please don't try it again, otherwise I shall have to go above your head. 
(Kelly leaves.) 
ELDRED: She's after your job, Julian. 
RADNOR: Miss Kelly! She's a fool. If we lose her, nothing can save us.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

(In the store room, Phipps has got three infra red lamps set up, pointing at the middle of the room, and plugged into the amplifier. He plugs that into the solar power line.) 
(Meanwhile, in the main control room, Fewsham staring at the T Mat cubicle and waiting. Kelly and two technicians appear.) 
FEWSHAM: Thank heavens you've come. 
KELLY: What happened? 
FEWSHAM: Osgood. It must have been space madness. He just went berserk, raving mad. It was terrifying. 
KELLY: Osgood? But he'd be the last man I'd have thought 
FEWSHAM: So did we. 
KELLY: Where are the others? 
FEWSHAM: When Osgood fused the controls, Locke tried to stop him. Osgood killed him. 
KELLY: This is fantastic! What about Phipps? 
FEWSHAM: Well, he was injured too. I've put him under sedation. 
KELLY: And you? 
FEWSHAM: There's nothing wrong with me. 
KELLY: You look frightened. 
FEWSHAM: If you'd seen Osgood die, wouldn't you be? 
KELLY: How did he die? 
FEWSHAM: His body's outside. He just went out. 
KELLY: Without a pressure suit? I see. Open all control sections and computer links. Fewsham, what are you doing? 
FEWSHAM: I thought I'd best switch off the emergency link. With the trouble we've got it could easily burn itself out. 
KELLY: Sensible. Anyway, it'll prevent Commander Radnor sending up a security guard to drag me back to Reception Earth. 
(Out of sight of the humans, Slaar gives his Warrior the usual order.) 
SLAAR: The other human is still free. Find him. He must not interfere with our plans.

[Solar Energy Store Room]

(Phipps has found a transmitter unit, and unplugs the infra-red array to power it.) 
PHIPPS: Hello, Earth Control this is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. How do you read me? Hello Earth Control, this is Moonbase. Emergency. Can you hear me? 
(Phipps takes the back off the transmitter unit.)

[Rocket]

ZOE: It's no use. No contact at all. Every circuit's dead. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear, this is most unfortunate. 
JAMIE: Aye, well don't try them again. You may blow the whole rocket up next time. 
ZOE: Well, there's no use worrying about the radio now. We're nearly at the end of the journey. 
DOCTOR: Well I had hoped we could stay in contact with Earth. 
ZOE: We don't need them. All we have to do is activate the Moon homing beam. 
JAMIE: Well, how do you do that? I thought we weren't in contact with anyone on the Moon? 
ZOE: Well, it's quite simple, Jamie. It's an automatic device. We send out code radio signals which triggers the homing beacon into action. We automatically lock onto it until we reach the point in orbit where we fire retro-rockets to land. 
JAMIE: Oh. Ah, but if they've all been cut off, how can they activate? 
DOCTOR: It works off a different power source, Jamie. Solar power. It's independent of the T-Mat system. 
JAMIE: Aye well, I just hope it works, that's all. 
ZOE: Well, if it doesn't we're going to have trouble docking at Moon Control airlock. It could be quite a crash. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: Well, lets try, shall we? I think we're near enough. There, that's our activating signal. 
ZOE: That's it. As long as that note is steady, we're home and dry, no trouble at all.

[Solar Energy Store Room]

(The homing beam light has lit up on the wall.) 
PHIPPS: Hello Earth Control, this is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. Can you hear me? Hello Earth Control, this is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. Can you hear me? 
(A Warrior in the corridor hears Phipps raise his voice.) 
PHIPPS: Hello Earth Control. This is Moonbase. Emergency! Can you hear me? Hello Earth Control. This is Moonbase. Can you hear me? 
(The Warrior enters.) 
PHIPPS: Hello Earth Control. 
(Phipps hears the Warrior behind him and quickly swaps the transmitter power for the infra red array. The room is filled with the light, and when Phipps switches off again, the Ice Warrior is just a dirty patch on the floor. Phipps plugs the transmitter back in.) 
PHIPPS: Hello Earth Control. This is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. Can you hear me? 
(The light on the rocket homing beam indicator has gone out.)

[Rocket]

ZOE: The homing beam, it's cut out! 
DOCTOR: I know, I know. I'm trying to re-activate it. 
JAMIE: What's gone wrong? I thought you said it was infallible? 
DOCTOR: Well, the solar power source must have been damaged, Jamie. 
JAMIE: You said we'd have trouble if that didn't work! 
DOCTOR: Yes. Without the beam it'll be impossible to land safely. 
JAMIE: You mean we'll crash? 
ZOE: Well, either that or drift on endlessly through space.

Episode Three

[Solar Power Store Room]

PHIPPS: Hello Earth Control. This is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. Can you hear me?

[Rocket]

ZOE: At our present rate of drift and allowing for the usual gravitational influences, we'll be drawn into the heart of the sun in approximately five months and ten days. 
JAMIE: No need to worry about that, then. 
ZOE: What do you mean? 
JAMIE: We've only got enough food and water for three days, remember? (The Doctor hears something over his headset.) 
DOCTOR: Just a minute. I think I'm getting something. 
PHIPPS [OC]: Hello Earth Control, this is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. Can you hear me? 
DOCTOR: Hello, Moonbase. Can you hear me?

[Solar Energy Store Room]

PHIPPS: Yes! Yes, I can hear you load and clear. What part of Earth are you speaking from? 
DOCTOR [OC]: We're not on the Earth. We're in a rocket orbiting the moon. 
PHIPPS: A rocket? But that's impossible!

[Rocket]

DOCTOR: Well I can assure you it's not impossible. What is your emergency? What's happening on Moonbase? 
PHIPPS [OC]: We've been invaded. Aliens have taken over.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

KELLY: Put that cover back on. Right, let's test it now. 
FEWSHAM: Do you really think it will work? 
KELLY: No reason why not. We've replaced the overloaded circuits. It should be all right. Turn on the power. Hold it. 
(Kelly adjusts something near the monitor.) 
KELLY: Try again. We'll T-Mat back to Earth and report to Commander Radnor. 
SLAAR: Stop! You will remain here. 
(Ice Warriors hem them in.) 
FEWSHAM: Don't move! Do exactly as they say! 
(A technician runs for the T-Mat cubicle and gets killed. The other tackles a warrior and also dies.) 
SLAAR: You will remain here.

[T Mat Earth Control]

RADNOR: Brent, has contact be re-established with Moonbase yet? 
BRENT: No, sir. As soon as Miss Kelly was transmitted the emergency link switched off again. 
ELDRED: And you've no idea what's happened? 
BRENT: Oh, I'm sure Miss Kelly will sort things out all right. 
RADNOR: I wish I had your optimism.

[Rocket]

DOCTOR: How much longer, Zoe? 
ZOE: Well, our orbit will bring us back into his range in approximately forty three seconds. 
DOCTOR: Let's hope he can still transmit. 
ZOE: Well, his signal was quite strong when we were orbiting his side of the moon. There's no reason for it to fade. 
DOCTOR: It's not his equipment I'm worried about, it's his survival. 
ZOE: Doctor, these aliens he described. 
DOCTOR: How much did you hear? 
ZOE: Bipeds, reptilian, armed with some kind of sonic device. 
JAMIE: Yes, Ice Warriors. 
ZOE: What? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Jamie and I have met them before. They come from the planet Mars. 
ZOE: Well, what do they want? 
DOCTOR: Mars is a dying planet. I imagine they're trying to find a new home. 
ZOE: Why the Moon? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I think that that's just a stepping stone. 
ZOE: What did you they were? Ice Warriors? 
JAMIE: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Well Mars, as you know, is a cold planet. They've adapted to that. It's heat they can't stand. 
ZOE: We should just about be coming into range now. 
DOCTOR: Hello Moonbase, hello Moonbase. Can you read me? 
PHIPPS [OC]: Yes, I read you loud and clear. 
DOCTOR: Oh thank heavens for that. Now listen. We need your help to make a landing. 
PHIPPS [OC]: But you mustn't land. You must warn Earth about what's happened here. 
DOCTOR: We can't do that. We've lost radio contact with the Earth. 
PHIPPS [OC]: Well then, go back and warn them. 
DOCTOR: We can't do that either. We haven't got enough fuel. We need to get to the fuel dump on the moon. 
PHIPPS [OC]: But they'll kill you! 
DOCTOR: Oh well, we'll just have to take that risk. Now, where are you Mister, er, what's? 
PHIPPS [OC]: Phipps. I'm in the Solar Energy Store. Now, what do you want me to do? 
ZOE: Doctor, if we could adapt our homing equipment to his radio signal, we could beam in on that. 
DOCTOR: Did you hear that? We want you to keep your transmitter going. 
PHIPPS [OC]: All right, I'll try, but I've no idea how long this transmitter can last. 
(The Doctor fastens some wires together.) 
DOCTOR: There, I think that's done it. Now then, let's see if we can pick up his signal. 
(Beep beep beep.) 
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, there we are. Now, Zoe, what about the approach trajectory? 
ZOE: Yes, here. 
DOCTOR: Ah good. Oh yes. Oh, I don't think I could have done better myself. 
ZOE: We need to fire the retro-rockets in seventeen point five seconds. 
DOCTOR: What? Well, landing positions, everyone. 
(They turn their seats around.) 
ZOE: Two seconds, one, now. 
(The Doctor flicks the Retro Rockets switch and the craft turns to head tail first for the moon.) 
ZOE: Let's hope there's enough fuel left to cushion down on. 
JAMIE: Aye, and let's hope that radio beam thing doesn't conk out before we get there. 
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Jamie. I'm sure we're going to be all right.

[Solar Energy Store Room]

PHIPPS: Hello Moon rocket. Can you hear me? 
DOCTOR [OC]: Hello Moonbase. Yes, we can. We are coming in on your signal now. Whatever you do, keep transmitting. 
(One of the diodes on top of the transmitter goes out. Of course.)

[Rocket]

DOCTOR: The signal! It's stopped! 
ZOE: Can you get us back into orbit? 
DOCTOR: No! No, I shall have to get us down as best I can. 
ZOE: But if we crash into a mountain range, we'll be smashed to pieces! 
(Phipps replaces the failed diode.) 
ZOE: It's working again. Doctor, can you lock back onto it? 
DOCTOR: Well, I'll try. Yes, yes, there it is. Oh, my word. I think we're going to be all right. 
(The entire craft comes down vertically onto the Moonbase pad with something of a bump.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'm sorry about the landing. Is everyone all right? 
JAMIE: Aye, well, we're down, that's that main thing. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZOE: Now what do we do? 
DOCTOR: Well, the first we must do is to refuel. You can see to that, Zoe, can't you. 
ZOE: Yes, but what are you going to do? 
DOCTOR: Well I must go in search of Mister Phipps. 
ZOE: But what about the Ice Warriors? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I've met them before. 
ZOE: But Doctor, you can't just go 
DOCTOR: Well I've got to rescue Mister Phipps, now haven't I? Now where did I put that map of. Ah. Here we are. Now then, the Solar Power room is. Here we are. Oh yes. Oh yes, that seems to be quite a simple route. 
JAMIE: Right, I'll come with you. 
DOCTOR: No. You'll stay here and look after Zoe. Now don't worry, you're going to be quite all right. 
JAMIE: Ah. 
DOCTOR: Good luck. 
ZOE: And to you. 
JAMIE: And to you. 
(The Doctor leaves the capsule.) 
JAMIE: Well, how do we refuel? 
ZOE: Oh, well, that's simple. It'll connect automatically from here. Now you watch this dial, and when it reads full, switch it off. Now do you think you can remember that? 
JAMIE: Of course I can. 
ZOE: Good. I want to have a look at the rocket motors. 
JAMIE: Why, what's the matter? 
ZOE: Well I didn't much like the way we landed. It could have caused some damage. 
JAMIE: Well, I know it was a bit rough, but surely it wasn't as bad as all that? 
(Jamie helps her down a service ladder.) 
ZOE: Well, it's not the landing that matters now, it's the take-off.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

(Fewsham is pressing buttons next to city names.) 
FEWSHAM: Tokyo. London. Canberra. That's the lot. The whole system's completely operational again. 
SLAAR: We can now send to any city in the world? 
FEWSHAM: Yes, anywhere there's a T-Mat centre. 
KELLY: Fewsham, do you realise what you're doing? 
FEWSHAM: I'm trying to save our lives. 
KELLY: And what about the people on Earth? 
FEWSHAM: We're in no position to argue. 
KELLY: Why do you want control of T-Mat? If you're going to invade the Earth, you'll be fighting the armed forces of the entire world. You'll never succeed. There'll be too much resistance. 
SLAAR: There will be no resistance. 
FEWSHAM: What about us? What'll happen to us? 
SLAAR: You will remain alive as long as you are useful. 
KELLY: You'll never get any help from me. 
SLAAR: When the time comes you will do exactly what you are told, or die.

[Solar Energy Store Room]

(The Doctor sneaks down corridors, following his map. He taps on the store room door and enters.) 
DOCTOR: Hello? 
(Phipps comes out from behind a box, wrench in hand.) 
PHIPPS: Who are you? 
DOCTOR: Oh! Oh, Mister Phipps, I presume? 
PHIPPS: Yes, but where'd you come from? 
DOCTOR: From the rocket. We were talking on the radio. 
PHIPPS: Thank heavens you made it. Are the others here too? 
DOCTOR: No, they're still in the rocket. How many of the Ice Warriors are there? 
PHIPPS: These creatures, you mean? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
PHIPPS: Well, there aren't many, but they're deadly. 
DOCTOR: Oh, they have their weak points. 
PHIPPS: Look, they've killed everybody here. All except Fewsham. He's helping them. 
DOCTOR: I see. Well, there's only one thing for it. We shall have to destroy T-Mat. 
PHIPPS: What!

[Rocket]

JAMIE: Are you all right, Doctor? 
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes. Have you refuelled the rocket, Jamie? 
JAMIE: Yes, we've just finished and Zoe's checking the rocket motors. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Oh good. I have found Mister Phipps. 
JAMIE: How is he? 
DOCTOR [OC]: Oh, he's quite all right but 
JAMIE: Aye, and you're bringing him back now? 
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes, eventually, Jamie, but I've got to put T-Mat out of action first. 
JAMIE: But, but, but Doctor, what about the Ice Warriors? 
DOCTOR [OC]: Now, don't worry. Jamie. You and Zoe prepare the rocket for take off and wait for us. Goodbye. 
JAMIE: But Doctor. Doctor. Hey! Och. 
(Zoe climbs up into the capsule.) 
JAMIE: That was the Doctor. He's found Phipps and he wants us to prepare the rocket for take off while they put T-Mat out of action. 
ZOE: But he can't! 
JAMIE: Why? 
ZOE: I've just checked the main power drive and the rocket's motors are completely useless. 
JAMIE: What? 
ZOE: The only way back to Earth is by T-Mat. 
JAMIE: Oh! 
ZOE: Doctor? Doctor, can you hear me? This is Zoe. Doctor! Oh he must have switched off! 
JAMIE: Oh, now what do we do? 
ZOE: We'll go and find him. Come on.

[Moonbase corridor]

DOCTOR: Where is this leading to? 
PHIPPS: Control Headquarters. Through this way. 
(Round a corner they see a Warrior with Kelly in its painful grasp.) 
DOCTOR: It's an Ice Warrior. It's got Miss Kelly. But how? 
(The Warrior aims its weapon at them.) 
DOCTOR: Run! 
(Phipps and the Doctor run different ways. Kelly gets free of the Warrior and runs after Phipps. The Doctor reappears and tackles the Warrior before leading it off on a diversion through various corridors. Just as he thinks he has lost it, two more are in front of him. He runs back through an area of mirrored panels that cast lots of reflections until he is trapped in front of a locked door.) 
DOCTOR: Stop! 
WARRIOR: You must be destroyed. 
DOCTOR: You've got no orders to kill me. Your leader will want to speak to me! 
WARRIOR: Humans are our enemies! 
DOCTOR: But I can be useful to you, like Fewsham. Your leader will be angry if you kill me. I'm a genius. 
WARRIOR: Genius? You will come with me. 
(Meanwhile, Jamie and Zoe don't have the benefit of a map.) 
JAMIE: Now which way? 
ZOE: I don't know. I'm lost. 
JAMIE: I thought you knew the way. 
ZOE: So did I. Let's try this way. 
JAMIE: Women! 
(They come to another junction.) 
JAMIE: Oh, no. We could wander around here all day. 
ZOE: Listen! Quick, here! 
(They hide behind a stanchion as a Warrior comes past.) 
ZOE: What was that thing? 
JAMIE: An Ice Warrior. You see, we were right. 
(The Warrior turns.) 
JAMIE: Quick, run. 
(Jamie and Zoe run down another corridor and hide again.) 
ZOE: Get back. Don't move. 
(The Warrior looks down the corridor then takes another one.) 
JAMIE: Now what do we do? 
ZOE: Keep looking for the Doctor and keep your eyes open for the solar energy room. Come on. 
JAMIE: Solar energy.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

FEWSHAM: I wish you'd tell me what you want me to do. 
SLAAR: You will shortly dispatch a cargo to certain cities on Earth. They will include Ottawa, Oslo, Stockholm, Hamburg. 
FEWSHAM: Cargo? What sort of cargo? 
(The Warriors enter with the Doctor.) 
WARRIOR: The prisoner Kelly has escaped. This human was in the corridors. 
SLAAR: Who are you? Where are you from? 
DOCTOR: I might ask you the same question. 
SLAAR: You will find the human Kelly and bring her back here. Who is this man? 
(The Warriors leave.) 
FEWSHAM: He's not one of the crew. I don't know him. He must have just arrived here. 
SLAAR: Impossible. We control T-Mat. How did you get here? 
DOCTOR: Our resources are not limited to T-Mat, you know. 
SLAAR: You arrived here by other means, by spacecraft? 
FEWSHAM: Rockets haven't been used for years. 
SLAAR: Then you are lying. You have been concealed here all the time. 
DOCTOR: But you can't be sure of that, can you? The people of the Earth may be preparing a whole fleet of rockets to defend themselves with. 
SLAAR: No. Earth relies entirely on T-Mat. There is no defence against our plans. 
DOCTOR: And what are your plans? Invasion by T-Mat? There are too few of you to conquer all the peoples of the Earth. 
(Two Warriors carry an opaque container between them.) 
WARRIOR: The Grand Marshall has ordered all the seeds to be prepared. You are to receive your instructions. 
SLAAR: Then guard the humans. If they try to escape, kill them. 
(Slaar leaves. The Warriors busy themselves with the container, so the Doctor speaks quietly to Fewsham.) 
DOCTOR: Why are you helping them? 
FEWSHAM: I've seen what they can do. 
DOCTOR: Do you know what is in that container? 
FEWSHAM: All I know is they want me to send something to Earth by T-Mat. I suppose that's what's in it. 
DOCTOR: Then I shall have to have a look inside, and you are going to help me.

[Solar Energy Store Room]

ZOE: The Doctor's been captured? But couldn't you help him? 
PHIPPS: I'm sorry. There was nothing we could do. 
KELLY: We had a job to reach here ourselves. 
JAMIE: Aye, so did we. 
ZOE: Are you sure the Ice Warriors don't know about this place? 
PHIPPS: Well, one of them did find it, but I managed to deal with him. 
ZOE: How? 
PHIPPS: Well, I fixed up a kind of booby trap to the solar energy power line. 
JAMIE: Ah. 
KELLY: By the look of those things I'd have though they were invulnerable. 
ZOE: No. The Doctor said they can't stand heat. 
JAMIE: Aye, that's right. 
PHIPPS: The heating system of the entire base is controlled from the Centre. Now if we could reach those controls and turn up the heating. 
ZOE: But how can we get there? There are Ice Warriors patrolling those corridors. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
PHIPPS: Yes I know. The maintenance tunnels. Over here. 
(A grill in the wall.) 
JAMIE: Hey, if we could get through here, then turn the heating up, knock the Warriors out, we could rescue the Doctor. 
KELLY: And T-Mat ourselves back to Earth. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
ZOE: But I thought T-Mat had broken down? 
KELLY: Not anymore. I repaired it. How can we get this cover off? 
PHIPPS: This part of the base hasn't been used for ages. It's rusted solid. It'll take some time. 
JAMIE: Aye, well, the Doctor may not have much time.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

DOCTOR: (sotto) All right, Fewsham. Now. 
FEWSHAM: I can't! They'll kill us both! 
DOCTOR: You have got to help me. 
FEWSHAM: I said I can't. 
DOCTOR: Very well, I shall do it by myself. If I'm caught, which is most likely, we will both get killed. 
FEWSHAM: All right. 
(Fewsham walks past a Warrior.) 
WARRIOR: Do not move! 
FEWSHAM: I was ordered to prepare the controls for transmission. I've have got to check that everything is in order. 
WARRIOR: Return to where you were. 
(The Doctor sneaks over to the container.) 
FEWSHAM: But this is most important! 
WARRIOR: If you are trying to escape, I shall destroy you. 
FEWSHAM: I'm not trying to escape. 
WARRIOR: Go back to where you were. 
FEWSHAM: All right, all right. 
(The Warrior sees the Doctor at the container. We hear it slam shut as the Doctor turns and raises his hands.) 
SLAAR: Wait! Open it. I said open it! 
(The container is full of six inch spheres.) 
DOCTOR: What are these things? (he picks one up) They look like seed pods. 
(The pod suddenly expands, goes pop and the Doctor coughs on the tiny particles it releases. He collapses.) 
FEWSHAM: What is it? What's happened to him? Is he dead?

[Solar Energy Store Room]

(Phipps and Jamie work at opening the grill to the maintenance tunnels. Zoe listens at the door.) 
JAMIE: That's it! 
ZOE: I think I heard something. 
KELLY: Be careful! 
(Zoe opens the door and looks out to see a Warrior in the corridor.) 
ZOE: There's one coming. I don't think he saw me. 
JAMIE: We won't take any chances. 
(Jamie jams a metal bar across the sliding door.) 
JAMIE: That should hold it. 
ZOE: Get back! 
(Everyone hides.) 
PHIPPS: Don't move. 
JAMIE: The booby trap thing, does it still work? 
PHIPPS: It'll have to be reconnected. 
JAMIE: Well, come on. 
PHIPPS: Miss Kelly. 
(Kelly plugs the infra red lamps back into the extension cable.) 
PHIPPS: Zoe. 
(Zoe hands him the power plug.) 
JAMIE: (hanging on to the door) Hurry up! 
(Phipps plugs the array into the solar-power line.) 
PHIPPS: Right! 
(Jamie lets go of the door handle and the Warrior enters.) 
KELLY: Now! 
(Phipps throws the switch, and a few seconds later there is another dirty mark on the floor.)

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

(A Warrior carries a seed pod towards the T-Mat.) 
SLAAR: You will prepare to activate the cubicle and transmit to London. Obey! 
(Fewsham sits at the controls.)

[T-Mat Earth Control]

COMPUTER: Emergency transport systems now in operation. However situation still extremely critical in most parts of the world. Primitive areas surviving best but all major cities now suffering severe food shortages. 
RADNOR: Without T-Mat, millions are going to die, especially in the cities.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

SLAAR: Activate! 
(The seed pod and its elegant stand vanish.)

[T Mat Earth Control]

(And appear. No one notices until the device chimes.) 
BRENT: Commander Radnor, the T-Mat is working. 
RADNOR: Working? Kelly must have got through! 
ELDRED: Splendid! What is it? 
(Brent opens the cubicle and touches the pod. It swells up.) 
BRENT: It's alive! 
(The pod continues to swell.)

Episode Four

[T Mat Earth Control]

BRENT: The thing's alive! 
(The pod goes pop and spreads its fine contents into the air. Brent gets a lungful of it in the cubicle and collapses.) 
ELDRED: Get away from here. Quick, quick! 
(Everyone else runs away, coughing.) 
RADNOR: He's dead. Keep back. It must be that smoke. Guards! Keep away from here! (the cubicle) 
ELDRED: Use the air conditioning! 
RADNOR: Switch the air conditioning to expel. 
(A technician obeys and the fine smoke or particles are sucked out through the grill.) 
ELDRED: It seems to be clearing. What was that thing? 
RADNOR: Careful, Daniel. 
ELDRED: It's all right. It's harmless enough now. It's shrivelled up. 
RADNOR: Get Brent's body over to the medical wing. Tell them that I want a full autopsy. 
(Technicians carry Brent away.) 
RADNOR: Now what do you make of that? 
ELDRED: Ever seen anything like that thing before? 
RADNOR: No. It looked like some sort of seed pod, but why do you think it exploded like that? 
ELDRED: Some plants reproduce that way. Their pods explode and spread their seeds. 
RADNOR: All this thing spread was some kind of smoke. 
ELDRED: Which has now been dispelled into the air of London.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

(The Ottawa light is flashing. A Warrior brings another pod from the container to the T Mat cubicle.) 
SLAAR: Prepare to dispatch. Dispatch. 
(The Oslo light flashes and another pod is fetched.) 
SLAAR: Hamburg. 
FEWSHAM: Why are we doing this? What are those things? 
SLAAR: Dispatch!

[Solar Energy Store Room]

(Kelly is working on one of the infra red lamps.) 
KELLY: Zoe, would you hold this for a moment? (the bulb) 
ZOE: What is it? 
KELLY: Well, this circuit was overloaded. It blew out when we destroyed that creature. I'm trying to repair it. Okay. 
(Zoe gives the bulb back.) 
ZOE: Well, this one looks all right. 
KELLY: Let's hope it works. 
ZOE: Well, let's hope we don't need it. 
(Zoe checks the maintenance tunnel.) 
ZOE: There's no sign of them. It isn't getting any warmer, is it. 
KELLY: Well they can't have had time to reach the heating controls yet. 
ZOE: And the heating controls are in the main control room, aren't they. 
KELLY: Yes. 
ZOE: And so are the Ice Warriors.

[Maintenance tunnel]

PHIPPS: Are you all right? 
JAMIE: Fine. 
(Phipps and Jamie come to a grill where they can see into the control room and the T Mat cubicle.) 
SLAAR: Paris. Dispatch! 
(Another pod is on its way.) 
JAMIE: What are they up to? 
PHIPPS: I don't know. It looks as though they're sending something by T-Mat. 
JAMIE: Who's that helping them? 
PHIPPS: Fewsham. 
JAMIE: Hey, can you see the Doctor anywhere? 
PHIPPS: No, there's no sign of him. I wonder what it is they're sending?

[T Mat Earth Control]

COMPUTER: The object appeared in reception cubicle T-Mat headquarters. Leading Technician Douglas D Grant in close proximity to the object collapsed and died instantly. Cause of death as yet unknown. Message from New York ends. 
RADNOR: That's another one. How many does that make? 
ELDRED: Sixteen T-Mat reception centres. 
RADNOR: How many deaths? 
ELDRED: Brent here, that man in Berlin, two in New York. But I doubt if those things were sent just to kill one or two people at random. 
RADNOR: What else then? 
ELDRED: Well, I don't know, but 
RADNOR: What? 
ELDRED: I'm wondering if there's any pattern with these cities. London, Ottawa, Oslo, Hamburg, Berlin. 
RADNOR: Yes, they're all major population centres, certainly. 
ELDRED: But is that all they have in common? 
(A printout arrives at the control panel.) 
ELDRED: What is it? 
RADNOR: The autopsy report on Brent. 
ELDRED: Well? 
RADNOR: He died of oxygen starvation. 
ELDRED: Oxygen starvation takes at least three or four minutes. He died instantly. 
RADNOR: Exactly. And according to this the medical unit can't believe it either. 
ELDRED: Obviously what killed him was that smoke-like substance which was emitted when the pods exploded, which was expelled into the outside atmosphere. Let's hope that diluted with air it loses it's toxic quality, otherwise 
(The pod's particles drift like mist in the wind, but where they touch the ground they quickly 'foam' up into bubbles which then burst and release more particles.)

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

SLAAR: Zurich. Dispatch! 
FEWSHAM: Is that the last? 
SLAAR: It may be necessary to send further seeds later. 
FEWSHAM: What about him? 
SLAAR: Is he still alive? 
(The Doctor is still out cold face down on the floor. Patrick Troughton is on holiday this week.) 
FEWSHAM: Yes, he's still breathing. 
SLAAR: That is unusual. Most humans would be dead. Take him to the T-Mat cubicle. 
FEWSHAM: What for? 
SLAAR: Do as I say.

[Maintenance tunnel]

JAMIE: What are they going to do? 
PHIPPS: Shush!

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

SLAAR: Dispose of him. 
FEWSHAM: What do you mean? 
SLAAR: You will adjust the T-Mat controls and suspend him in space between the moon and Earth.

[Maintenance tunnel]

JAMIE: We've got to try and save him. 
PHIPPS: Back of the cubicle. Over here, quick.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

FEWSHAM: But you can't just ask me to kill a man just like that. 
SLAAR: You dispatched the seeds. In so doing you destroyed your entire species. 
FEWSHAM: Oh, no! 
SLAAR: What is the death of one man compared to that? 
FEWSHAM: What was in those things? 
SLAAR: No more questions. Operate the controls. 
FEWSHAM: I can't. I can't! 
SLAAR: Prefer to die. 
FEWSHAM: T-Mat is only programmed to send to other centres. I shall have to reprogramme the circuit. 
SLAAR: Then do so at once.

[Maintenance tunnel]

JAMIE: Are you sure this is the back of the right cubicle? 
PHIPPS: It'd better be.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

SLAAR: Well? 
FEWSHAM: Please. Please don't make me. 
SLAAR: Complete it!

[Maintenance tunnel]

(Phipps and Jamie remove a grill.) 
PHIPPS: Right. 
JAMIE: Oh no! 
(There is a second grill.) 
PHIPPS: Oh, it's only the interior casing. It comes away easily. 
JAMIE: Oh.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

SLAAR: Is the circuit prepared yet? 
FEWSHAM: Yes, almost. Almost. 
SLAAR: You are wasting time. Operate. 
FEWSHAM: No! 
SLAAR: At once! 
(Fewsham reaches for a switch. The T-Mat cubicle is empty.) 
FEWSHAM: You've killed him. You've killed him! You've killed him! 
SLAAR: Prepare to dispatch to London. Do as I say! 
(Slaar goes over to a Warrior.) 
SLAAR: The time has come for your mission. You understand what you must do? 
WARRIOR: I understand. 
SLAAR: You must succeed at all costs. 
(The Warrior goes into a cubicle.) 
SLAAR: Transmit to London. 
FEWSHAM: I need time. I must reprogramme.

[Maintenance tunnel]

PHIPPS: Can you manage the Doctor by yourself? 
JAMIE: Yes. 
PHIPPS: Can you remember the way back? 
JAMIE: Oh, I think so. 
PHIPPS: I'll try and get to the heating controls. 
JAMIE: Good. 
(Phipps makes his way up an access ladder and around the back of the control room. From another grill he can see the heating controls on the wall opposite, looking like a ship's wheel. He tries to get through an access plate but his shoulders are too wide.)

[T Mat Earth Control]

(Back on Earth, the spores are spreading and reproducing rapidly, covering the ground with a mass of foam.) 
COMPUTER: Reports now received on cause of death of T-Mat reception technicians in New York and Berlin. In all cases victims died of oxygen starvation. 
RADNOR: Discontinue report. 
ELDRED: Wait a minute. There's something else. 
RADNOR: All right. Continue report. 
COMPUTER: Information coming in on appearance of vegetable blight now attacking parks and gardens in the metropolises. Many areas 
(The Warrior bursts out of the T-Mat cubicle. Technicians flee as it moves towards them.) 
COMPUTER: Unidentified menace. Foam appears to be byproduct of large fungi which grow and burst, spreading their spores over large areas. Rate of growth of fungi such that acres of ground are covered minutes. Estimated that strong south westerly winds could spread this disease over large areas of Europe and Asia. 
RADNOR: Guards! 
COMPUTER: Destroying second crop cereals. 
(A guard rushes in, firing. The Warrior uses its own weapon on him then walks out into the corridor where there is more gunfire. Radnor picks up the dead guard's gun and goes into the corridor. The Warrior's weapon can be heard. Radnor returns.) 
RADNOR: The guards. It's killed them. It's killed them all!

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

SLAAR: I shall return shortly. You will remain here. (to another Warrior) The humans that escaped, have they been found? 
WARRIOR: We are searching for them. 
SLAAR: Intensify the search. They must be found and destroyed. Guard him.

[Solar Energy Store Room]

(The Doctor is lying on a table, his face turned away from us.) 
ZOE: How is he? 
KELLY: I think the water helped him. 
JAMIE: Aye, well, we'd better get back there. We've still got to get those heating control things. 
PHIPPS: It's no good, Jamie, we'll never make it. 
JAMIE: Why not? 
PHIPPS: Because the ventilator's too small and there's no other way. 
JAMIE: Well, maybe I could get through. 
PHIPPS: Look, it's impossible. 
ZOE: How big is this grill? 
PHIPPS: About so big. 
(Zoe steps between his hands.) 
ZOE: Well I could get through. 
JAMIE: No, Zoe. You're not going. 
ZOE: Look, I'm smaller than you and I'll probably be a lot quieter too. 
JAMIE: Look, it's too dangerous anyway. 
ZOE: Well, what other alternative is there? 
JAMIE: Well. 
KELLY: She's right. It's the logical thing to do. 
ZOE: Thank you. Well come on, show me the way.

[T Mat Earth Control]

(The Warrior walks through the exploding pods outside.) 
ELDRED: He can't just have vanished. 
RADNOR: I can assure you that the security guards have lost all trace of it. 
ELDRED: I wonder what its purpose was? 
RADNOR: Purpose? What are you talking about? 
ELDRED: Well, can't you see it's all part of the same plan. First the seed pods and now this creature. I tell you it came here for some purpose, and heaven help anyone who gets in its way. 
(Some defence technicians are spraying the foam, trying to kill it. They get covered in it but are wearing breathing apparatus. The Warrior advances. It kills one and the others flee.) 
ELDRED: Any trace yet of the alien creature? 
COMPUTER: Reports from security negative. 
RADNOR: There you are, what did I tell you. 
COMPUTER: Security reports cordon round T-Mat complex unbroken. 
ELDRED: At least we know it's still in the area. 
COMPUTER: Correction. Urgent message. Bodies of three technicians found in T-Mat grounds.

[Maintenance tunnel]

ZOE: Which way now? 
PHIPPS: I'm not sure. 
ZOE: But you must remember. You've already been this way once with Jamie. 
PHIPPS: Yes, I know, but I can't remember this time. 
ZOE: But surely 
PHIPPS: Look, I can't remember! All the tunnels look the same. 
ZOE: Are you all right? 
PHIPPS: Oh yes, I'm fine. I've seen most of my friends killed. I'm being hunted by monsters. 
ZOE: If you go on shouting like that, you'll be caught by them and so will I. 
PHIPPS: I'm sorry. I don't know what's the matter with me. 
ZOE: It's nervous exhaustion and a slight touch of claustrophobia. Just sit down and we'll have a rest.

[T Mat Earth Control]

ELDRED: I tell you that creature came here for some purpose. It must be making for somewhere. Somewhere in this area. 
COMPUTER: Urgent message. Contact made with security guard observing the alien. 
RADNOR: Relay report direct. 
GUARD [OC]: Report to Central control.

[T Mat Earth Control grounds]

GUARD: Report to Central control. The creature is entering the east compound area. 
(The Warrior sees the guard who making the report. He starts to run, but is too late.) 
RADNOR [OC]: What's happened? Report.

[T Mat Earth Control]

RADNOR: What's happened? Report! 
COMPUTER: Security guard's ceased transmission. 
RADNOR: Tell Security I want a armed patrol sent to the east command area without fail. Immediately. And relay any findings to me here direct. Top priority. 
ELDRED: You're only going to lose more security guards. 
RADNOR: Well, I can't let that creature roam loose, can I? 
ELDRED: Can we stop it? Do you know how we can stop it? You know that bullets will do no good. We've seen that for ourselves. In all these cities that. Wait a moment. Yes! Oslo, Ottawa, Berlin, Hamburg, London, Paris, New York! These are the places where the pods have arrived. 
RADNOR: Well, so what? 
ELDRED: Well, don't you see? They're all cold climates. All northern hemisphere. In all of those cities it's winter, as it is here. 
RADNOR: So? 
ELDRED: Why haven't the pods arrived in any warm areas? 
COMPUTER: Urgent message. Subject, continued breakdown of T-Mat and cessation of all world transport and distribution. Total breakdown of social order predicted. Emergency measures proving inadequate. 
RADNOR: Discontinue report. 
COMPUTER: Incoming data will be recorded. 
ELDRED: Well, the emergency measures may still save a few people. 
RADNOR: Well, what's the good of that? With the dislocation of food supplies, we could lose millions. 
ELDRED: We may lose most of the world's population before they've finished with us. 
RADNOR: They? 
ELDRED: This creature. It's only the first. We're going to be invaded!

[Solar Energy Store Room]

KELLY: Any sign of them? 
JAMIE: No. 
KELLY: They've been gone ages. They can't have reached the heating controls yet. The temperature seems the same. 
JAMIE: Look, I'm going down there. 
KELLY: No, our job is to act as a rearguard in case something goes wrong. 
JAMIE: Look, a lot of good we are. 
KELLY: Well, we're not entirely helpless. 
JAMIE: You've got that thing working again? 
KELLY: I think so, but we can hardly test it. 
JAMIE: Oh look, where are they? What's keeping them?

[Maintenance tunnel]

ZOE: I think we ought to go on. 
PHIPPS: All right. 
ZOE: Look, can you remember the way now? 
PHIPPS: No, it's no good. 
ZOE: We could work it out. 
PHIPPS: How? 
ZOE: Well, presumably these maintenance tunnels run parallel to the corridors. 
PHIPPS: Well, yes they do, but. 
ZOE: Well, I've seen a map of the corridors. The Doctor had one in the rocket. 
PHIPPS: But you can't possibly remember 
ZOE: Yes I can, I think. Now there's a main corridor here, the two junctions here. We went left, right, left. It must be that one. 
PHIPPS: But you and Jamie got lost on the way to the solar energy storeroom. 
ZOE: Well, only temporarily, I found the way eventually. 
PHIPPS: Well, you'd better be right this time. 
ZOE: Oh come on! 
(A little later, Zoe and Phipps are looking into the Control room.) 
ZOE: Oh, how long is it going to stand there? 
PHIPPS: I don't know. But I daren't move the grille until it goes.

[Solar Energy Store Room]

JAMIE: Look, I'd better see what's happened to them. 
KELLY: All right, but 
JAMIE: What? 
KELLY: Shush. Quick, the door! 
JAMIE: Too late! 
(As Warrior enters.) 
JAMIE: (silent) Now! 
(Kelly turns on the solar power line but nothing happens.) 
JAMIE: (silent) Come on. 
(The Warrior turns to leave then returns.) 
JAMIE: (silent) Keep back. 
(The Warrior goes over to the Doctor, still lying on the table.)

[Maintenance tunnel]  

PHIPPS: He's moving. 
ZOE: Quick, move the grille!

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

FEWSHAM: How much longer must I wait here? 
WARRIOR: Do not ask questions! 
FEWSHAM: I need food, rest. I haven't had any sleep for hours. 
(Fewsham spots Zoe and Phipps peering out of the grille.) 
WARRIOR: What are you doing? 
FEWSHAM: I must fix the cubicle. 
WARRIOR: But you said T-Mat was functioning properly. 
FEWSHAM: I know, but there's something I've forgotten. 
(The Warrior follows Fewsham, with its back to the grille.)

[Maintenance tunnel]

PHIPPS: Quick! Now the heating controls are over there. Turn the main wheel to full.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

(Zoe sneaks around the wall, in front of a brightly lit screen, to the heating wheel. But it is stiff, she can't move it at first. Finally she moves it 180 degrees right and starts to creep back as the temperature climbs rapidly. The Warrior spots her.) 
PHIPPS: Look out, Zoe! 
(The Warrior kills Phipps. Zoe stands in front of the bright panel.) 
ZOE: Well, help me, can't you? Help me! 
(The Warrior walks towards Zoe.)

Episode Five

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

(Fewsham finally acts, and tries to deflect the Warrior's aim away from Zoe. It knocks him away as Zoe stands frozen in fear. The temperature is climbing up to forty degrees C, and the Warrior suddenly puts its claws to its head and collapses. Zoe runs over to Fewsham.) 
ZOE: Are you all right? 
FEWSHAM: Yes, I am. Who are you? What are you doing here? 
ZOE: Oh, never mind that. I thought you were on their side. 
FEWSHAM: Is that what they all think? 
ZOE: Well, you have been helping them, haven't you. 
FEWSHAM: I had no alternative. They'd have killed me. 
ZOE: Well look, where are the other Ice Warriors? 
FEWSHAM: I think they've gone to their ship, but they'll be coming back. We must get out of here. 
ZOE: Oh but how? 
FEWSHAM: Look, I can get you back to Earth. T-Mat is working again. 
ZOE: Oh! Well, I'll get back to the others and tell them the good news.

[Solar Energy Store Room]

(The Warrior is about to leave when the Doctor starts groaning.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, Victoria, Jamie. 
(The Warrior walks past Jamie's hiding place and he smashes down on its weapon with a metal bar. It throws him across the room so Kelly has a go too. She is easily thrown off and it grabs Jamie's wrists.) 
JAMIE: No! 
(The thermometer passes fifty degrees C and the Warrior collapses.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, well done, Jamie. 
KELLY: Are you all right? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. Oh, I'm a bit dizzy. It's so hot in here. 
JAMIE: Aye, lucky for us. Zoe and Phipps turned the heating up just in time. 
DOCTOR: What? Well, where are they now? 
KELLY: They went though the maintenance tunnel to the main control room. 
(Zoe enters through the hatch.) 
DOCTOR: Ah, Zoe! 
ZOE: Oh Doctor! (they hug) Oh, are you all right? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. 
ZOE: Good. 
JAMIE: Where's Phipps? 
ZOE: He's dead. An Ice Warrior killed him. 
KELLY: How did you manage to escape? 
ZOE: That other man helped me. 
KELLY: Fewsham? 
ZOE: Yes. 
KELLY: Well I thought that he was working for them. 
ZOE: He saved my life. 
KELLY: Doesn't sound much like Fewsham. 
ZOE: He attacked a Warrior. He's also got T-Mat working again. 
DOCTOR: Well, do I gather we can get back to Earth then? 
ZOE: Yes, I think so. 
KELLY: Well, let's not waste any more time. 
ZOE: No. Come on.

[T Mat Earth Control]

RADNOR: Well, that's all we need. 
ELDRED: What is it? 
RADNOR: Gregson's here. 
ELDRED: Gregson, eh? 
RADNOR: Sir James Gregson. 
ELDRED: United Nations Plenipotentiary. 
RADNOR: Minister with special responsibility for T-Mat. 
ELDRED: And your boss, in other words! 
RADNOR: Oh, don't. 
(An older man enters and hands his briefcase to Radnor.) 
GREGSON: Radnor, I've read your report. I can't make head nor tail of it. Who's this? 
RADNOR: Professor Eldred, sir. 
ELDRED: How do you do. 
GREGSON: Oh well. 
RADNOR: He's helping me, sir. 
GREGSON: This breakdown of T-Mat. What is the position now? 
RADNOR: Still no contact yet with Moonbase, sir. 
GREGSON: And what are you doing about it? 
RADNOR: We've got people up there. 
GREGSON: How'd you get them there without T-Mat? 
RADNOR: We sent a rocket, sir. Professor Eldred is an expert in rocketry. 
GREGSON: Oh, I see. And what happened to the rocket? 
RADNOR: It's rather difficult to say, sir. We lost radio contact with it soon after take-off. 
GREGSON: Is that all you've done? 
RADNOR: Oh no. No, my Chief Technician, Miss Kelly, has also gone to Moonbase. 
GREGSON: Oh, more rockets. 
RADNOR: No, sir, she went by T-Mat. 
GREGSON: But T-Mat isn't working. 
RADNOR: Well, T-Mat started to function again, sir, so Miss Kelly went to the Moonbase with a repair team. 
GREGSON: So you've had a full report from her? 
RADNOR: Well, no, sir. Soon after take off T-Mat ceased to function again. 
GREGSON: But this is quite ridiculous. T-Mat out of action and then this sudden outbreak of some sort of crop blight. 
RADNOR: Ah, now, you see, sir, we think that's connected 
GREGSON: As for this incredible story about a monster from outer-space 
RADNOR: Well you see, Sir James, I think I owe you an explanation. 
GREGSON: What happened about this creature? Have you any more news? 
ELDRED: No, it seems to have completely disappeared. It was reported here, then it was seen by some workmen in a building here, and the last sighting was by the Weather Control Bureau there. 
(The Warrior walks through the foam to the Weather Control building and forces its way inside. The duty weatherman tries to run but is killed. It then goes to a convenient Weather Control Unit and moves all the levers to 'Dry', then uses its weapon on it, fusing the controls in place.)

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

FEWSHAM: But I had to help them or they would have killed me! 
KELLY: All right, Fewsham. There'll be a full inquiry when we get back to Earth. Tell them. We've no more time to waste here. We must T-Mat back to Earth immediately. 
DOCTOR: But if we're all going, who is going to dispatch us? 
FEWSHAM: Look, there's a way of doing that. Here. This is a time switch. It delays transportation by ten seconds. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. How ingenious. 
FEWSHAM: Now I'll dispatch you, and follow using the time switch. 
DOCTOR: Righto. Jamie, Zoe, come along. I think this could be quite fun, you know. 
JAMIE: Oh. 
(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe get into a cubicle.) 
KELLY: Fewsham, that time switch was down on the maintenance report as being inoperable. 
FEWSHAM: We repaired it. 
(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie vanish.) 
FEWSHAM: In you get, Miss Kelly. Look, I'll use the time switch. You'd better hurry or those Ice Warriors could be back any minute.

[T Mat Earth Control]

DOCTOR: You know, I find T-Mat travel rather disappointing. There's no sensation at all. 
RADNOR: Where have you been? 
DOCTOR: Ah. 
RADNOR: And what have you been up to all this time? 
DOCTOR: Well 
RADNOR: And where's Miss Kelly. 
(Kelly appears in the T-Mat cubicle.) 
RADNOR: Miss Kelly! Miss Kelly, what's happening up there? 
GREGSON: Will somebody kindly tell me what's happening down here? Who are these people? Is T-Mat working again? 
DOCTOR: Please! Let us answer one question at a time. 
ELDRED: Doctor, do you know there's been a alien here? 
JAMIE: An Ice Warrior, here? 
DOCTOR: Jamie, I am not surprised. They have taken over the whole of the Moonbase. 
RADNOR: What about the crew? 
KELLY: All dead except Fewsham. 
RADNOR: You left him there? 
KELLY: Well he said he'd follow using the time switch. 
DOCTOR: He should be back. 
(Kelly goes to the control panel.) 
RADNOR: What's happening? 
KELLY: I thought so. The time switch is out of order. 
DOCTOR: What? But he said he was going to repair it. 
KELLY: He was lying. 
RADNOR: But why? 
KELLY: Well, he's obviously working for them. 
DOCTOR: Then why did he let us escape?

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

(Fewsham is waiting. As soon as he hears Slaar's breathing he pretends to be unconscious across the control desk. Slaar staggers in and goes over to the temperature control. Fewsham follows him. Slaar turns the temperature down to cold.) 
SLAAR: What has happened here? 
FEWSHAM: The others, they got in through the grille and turned up the heating. 
SLAAR: Where are they now? 
FEWSHAM: They went back to Earth by T-Mat. 
SLAAR: Why did you not go with them? 
FEWSHAM: I refused. That's why they attacked me. 
SLAAR: Refused? Why? 
FEWSHAM: What do you think would have happened to me back on Earth? I'd have been executed as a traitor. 
SLAAR: So you hope to live longer by staying here. You value your life. That is good. You will live if you help us when the invasion fleet arrives. 
FEWSHAM: You're going to land on Earth? 
SLAAR: No, our warriors will land here, on the moon. When the seed pods have done their work on Earth it will be time to commence the second stage of our plan.

[T Mat Earth Control]

DOCTOR: But don't you see gentlemen? The invasion of Moonbase, the taking over of T-Mat, the seed pods, the arrival of the Ice Warrior. They're all part of the same plan. 
RADNOR: Plan? What plan? 
GREGSON: These incidents are so unrelated. This fungus everywhere, what's that got to do with it? 
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not sure yet. Have your people been able to make anything of it? 
RADNOR: Well it's indestructible. We've attacked it in every possible way, but without success. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but have you tried to understand it? 
GREGSON: Are you suggesting we should psychoanalyse it, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I'm only suggesting that instead of trying to destroy it, you find out it's composition and purpose.
ELDRED: Well, there's laboratory equipment in my workshop. You could use that. 
DOCTOR: Good. Then we must find a sample. 
RADNOR: Well, no problem about that. The gardens are full of the stuff. 
DOCTOR: Fine. Then there's no time to be lost. 
ELDRED: I'll get some equipment for you. 
RADNOR: Er, Doctor, do be careful. Those pod things are deadly. 
DOCTOR: Don't worry. I've already had experience. I'll be careful.

[T Mat Earth Rest area]

(Zoe and Jamie are sipping drinks while Kelly writes on a clip board.) 
ZOE: But why did Fewsham stay on the moon? 
KELLY: Pretty obvious. He was too afraid to come back here and face an inquiry. 
ZOE: But he wasn't afraid to stay up there with the Ice Warriors. Well, given the choice I know which I'd rather face. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
KELLY: There's no time to worry about Fewsham. We must find a way of getting T-Mat working. 
ZOE: But I thought it was working again now. 
KELLY: It is working. It's still controlled from the moon. We must find a way of controlling it from the Earth. 
ZOE: But is that possible? Don't you need the moon as a relay? 
KELLY: There might be a way. I must talk to Commander Radnor about it. 
(Kelly leaves.) 
JAMIE: Zoe, look, do you think the Doctor knows what he's doing messing about with that foam stuff? 
ZOE: Oh, don't worry, Jamie. He'll be all right. 
JAMIE: Oh, yes. 
(Outside, the Doctor gets a sample of fungus on a spatula and puts it in a large glass container, oblivious to the bubble growing nearby. It bursts, and he leaps up in alarm. Covering his mouth with a large kerchief, he quickly scoops up foam with the container and runs.)

[T Mat Earth Control]

RADNOR: You really think it would work? 
KELLY: Well, it couldn't be as effective as the Moonbase, of course, which handles up to two million microwave channels simultaneously. The satellite would take just a few thousand. 
GREGSON: But that'd be enough for vital food supplies. 
RADNOR: But surely we can't use the normal communications satellites. They're not programmed for T-Mat. 
KELLY: No, we'd have to send up a specially programmed one. 
ZOE: But that would mean using a rocket, wouldn't it? I thought no one used them nowadays. 
KELLY: Not manned rockets, but we do send up satellites for communications. 
RADNOR: How soon can you get one up? 
KELLY: Well I don't know. If it were given top priority.

[Eldred's laboratory]

(Under a microscope cells divide rapidly.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, it's organic. It's alive. Definitely a fungus composition. 
(The Doctor picks up a molecular model.) 
DOCTOR: You're sure that this is correct? 
ELDRED: As far as I can make out, it is. 
DOCTOR: A molecule of five atoms absorbs oxygen. You know, a complete blanket of this would reduce the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere quite drastically. 
ELDRED: According to my calculations, to one twentieth of normal. 
DOCTOR: It would make the atmosphere of the Earth uninhabitable to the human race, but exactly like the atmosphere of Mars. 
(A beaker is foaming out onto the bench.) 
DOCTOR: Look at that. Even without vegetation to feed on, it's still active. 
(A bubble grows.) 
DOCTOR: Oh! 
ELDRED: Look out, Doctor. If that thing explodes in here, the fumes will kill us. Come on, Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Just a minute, there must be some way of 
(The Doctor puts his kerchief over his mouth and starts pouring liquids onto the bubble.) 
ELDRED: Come on, before its too late! 
DOCTOR: Sulphuric acid. Hydrochloric acid. Acetic acid. 
ELDRED: Come on, Doctor! 
(The Doctor tips the contents of a large measuring glass over the bubble, and it starts to shrink.) 
ELDRED: You've done it! Well, what was it? What did you throw on it?

[T Mat Earth Control]

COMPUTER: Extensive search by security forces reveals no trace of alien creature. Message ends. 
JAMIE: So that warrior's still roaming around loose somewhere. 
ZOE: But why did they only send one of them? 
ZOE: Well, perhaps he's got to report back somehow. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Is Commander Radnor there, please? Ah, Zoe! Is Radnor there? 
ZOE: No, he's in conference with Miss Kelly and Sir James Gregson. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. Zoe, it's the most wonderful news. We've found a way of destroying the fungus. 
ZOE: Well, what is it? 
DOCTOR: Water. Ordinary water! 
JAMIE: Eh? 
ZOE: Oh, but Doctor, surely ordinary 
DOCTOR: There's no time to explain now. Apparently there is a Weather Control Bureau somewhere. I want you to get in touch with them. 
ZOE: Well, can't you reach them on the video-phone? 
DOCTOR: Well, no. No, I've tried, but they're not answering or it's broken down or something. 
ZOE: What do you want me to do? 
DOCTOR: Well, get in touch with Commander Radnor and ask him to get hold of the Weather Control Bureau people and to make rain. As much rain as possible over the entire country. 
ZOE: All right, Doctor. I'll tell him. 
DOCTOR: Right. The Professor and I are coming back now. 
ZOE: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Bye. 
(Transmission ends.) 
ZOE: But Doctor, suppose that? Oh! 
JAMIE: Hey, how do we get hold of Commander Radnor? 
ZOE: We'll ask the computer. 
JAMIE: Do you know how it works? 
ZOE: Yes, of course. Put me in touch with Commander Radnor at once. 
COMPUTER: Commander Radnor engaged in top level T-Mat conference with Chief Technician Kelly and Sir James Gregson. 
ZOE: But this is urgent. I must talk to him at once! 
COMPUTER: Commander Radnor not available. 
JAMIE: Oh, now what do we do? 
ZOE: We just have to go to the Weather Bureau ourselves. 
JAMIE: We don't know where it is. 
ZOE: Well, we'll have to try and find it. Come on. 
JAMIE: Oh, Zoe.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

(Two Warriors wheel in a fancy device with a small monitor set into it.) 
SLAAR: There. 
FEWSHAM: What is it? 
SLAAR: Communications unit from our ship. Connect it to the solar batteries. 
FEWSHAM: What's this section for? 
SLAAR: That does not concern you. 
FEWSHAM: I can't connect equipment if I don't know its purpose. 
SLAAR: It transmits a directional beam signal. 
FEWSHAM: A homing device. You'll use it to guide your armada onto the moon? 
SLAAR: You will not ask questions. You will do as you are told!

[Weather Control Bureau]

(Jamie and Zoe pick their way around the side of the building avoiding the foam which is creeping ever nearer to the open main door, and go inside.) 
JAMIE: Hadn't we better close the door? 
ZOE: Why? 
JAMIE: In case that warrior's still prowling around out there. 
(They push the door closed and the foam piles up against it outside. Jamie turns a knob to lock it.) 
JAMIE: That should keep him out. Come on. 
(They go down some steps.) 
JAMIE: Well, where is everybody? 
ZOE: I don't know. Well, let's try and find the main control room. Come on.

[Weather Control Room]

(The weatherman's body is still there.) 
ZOE: So that's why nobody answered the video-phone. 
JAMIE: Hey, and look at that! 
(Jamie tries to move the fused control unit levers.) 
JAMIE: No, it's no good. They're locked in position. 
ZOE: Well, don't you see? It's what the Doctor said. Water. Rain. Well, it all makes sense now. They don't want it to rain on the fungus. 
JAMIE: Well, shush! It's a warrior. Hide! 
(The Warrior's heavy breathing has preceded it again, and Jamie and Zoe are hidden by the time it enters.)

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

(Slaar is talking to his superior on their own monitor. The Grand Marshall has sequins on his helmet.) 
MARSHALL [on monitor]: Are all the preparations complete? 
SLAAR: Yes, Grand Marshall. The seed pods have been dispatched to the cities of the Earth, and the Moonbase is in our hands. 
MARSHALL [on monitor]: Good. Our fleet is approaching the gravitational field of the moon. Is all prepared? 
SLAAR: Everything is ready. I shall guide our ships in on the homing beam signal. 
MARSHALL [on monitor]: Fuel supplies are at marginal level. There must be no misjudgments. 
(Fewsham quietly switches on the video-link.)

[T Mat Earth Control]

(A rocket stands at a gantry.) 
COMPUTER: Final checkout routines under way. 
KELLY: I hope they know what they're doing. It's been years since we sent up a satellite. 
RADNOR: Are you quite sure the communications aspects will function? 
KELLY: Yes. Once that satellite's up, T-Mat will be able to handle two thousand microwave channels. 
(Eldred and the Doctor enter.) 
ELDRED: What's going on? Someone sending up a rocket? 
RADNOR: Look, look! What the devil's happening? 
(The video-link shows the scene on the Moon.) 
KELLY: I don't know. It's, yes, Moon Control. 
DOCTOR: The sound, can you turn it up? 
FEWSHAM [on monitor]: Shouldn't we test the directional beam?

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

SLAAR: It is not necessary. 
FEWSHAM: But it's operating on Moonbase power. I can't guarantee the pulsing rate will be the same. 
SLAAR: Very well. Test it.

[T Mat Earth Control]

DOCTOR: Commander Radnor, can this be recorded? 
RADNOR: Well, yes. 
DOCTOR: Well quickly, man. It's vital! 
RADNOR: The transmission coming in on the video machine is to be recorded. 
COMPUTER: Instructions understood. Transmission will be recorded. 
SLAAR [on monitor]: The device is operating. 
FEWSHAM [on monitor]: Wait a moment.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

FEWSHAM: I must check the connections. 
SLAAR: Why? 
FEWSHAM: If the power fails we won't be able to guide the fleet onto the moon. 
SLAAR: There must be no failures. 
FEWSHAM: I realise the importance of that. If we overshoot the moon, nothing will stop them from going straight into an orbit around the sun. 
SLAAR: They will not overshoot! 
FEWSHAM: Of course not. But since their fuel supplies are at a marginal level, if anything did go wrong, they'd never be able to regain moon orbit. 
SLAAR: This video device is operating. You have betrayed us! 
FEWSHAM: Every word has bee heard on Earth! 
SLAAR: Kill him! 
(A warrior obeys. Earth Control sees Fewsham die, then Slaar has the video camera destroyed too.)

[T Mat Earth Control]

COMPUTER: Countdown about to commence. Minus three minutes. 
DOCTOR: Cancel the launch! 
KELLY: Why? What do you mean? 
DOCTOR: We can use that satellite to mislead the Martian invasion fleet. 
RADNOR: What? 
DOCTOR: Well, don't you see? Poor Fewsham deliberately let us overhear their homing signal. We can imitate that signal with a homing device of our own in the satellite! 
RADNOR: Commander Radnor. Top priority message to satellite launching site. Cancel launch. Repeat, cancel launch! 
COMPUTER: Message understood. 
DOCTOR: If we can deflect their armada, half our battle is won. 
RADNOR: But there's still all that fungus stuff everywhere. 
ELDRED: We've solved that one. Plain ordinary H20. Water! 
RADNOR: Water?! Well, all we need to do then is to make it rain. 
DOCTOR: Well, haven't you already done that? Haven't you been in touch with the Weather Control Bureau? 
RADNOR: You've only just told me. 
DOCTOR: But I sent you a message over an hour ago. Didn't Zoe reach you? 
RADNOR: No. 
KELLY: An hour ago we were in conference. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. Well, perhaps Zoe went to the Weather Control people herself? 
ELDRED: Doctor, the Weather Control Bureau was the last place the warrior was sighted! 
DOCTOR: What? 
RADNOR: I'll have a squad of security guards over there right away. Hadn't you better wait, Doctor? 
(The Doctor has left.) 
RADNOR: Get me Security!

[Outside the Weather Control Bureau]

(Kerchief over his mouth, the Doctor picks his way carefully to the door, which no longer has foam up against it until he gets there, then it is up to his shoulders. Bubbles grow and burst as he hammers on the door.) 
DOCTOR: Zoe! Are you in there? Zoe!

[Weather Control Room]

DOCTOR [OC]: Zoe! Jamie! Let me in! 
(The Warrior turns back from Zoe and Jamie's hiding place to investigate the noise.)

[Outside the Weather Control Bureau]

DOCTOR: Zoe! Jamie! Zoe! 
(The Doctor moves out of the doorway to see a tidal wave of foam and bubbles bearing down.) 
DOCTOR: Oh no! 
(The Doctor slips and disappears under the foam, then gets up to hammer again on the door.) 
DOCTOR: Zoe!

[Weather Control Room]

DOCTOR [OC]: Let me in! Zoe! Jamie!

[Outside the Weather Control Bureau]

DOCTOR: Zoe! Jamie! If you're there, let me in! Oh, no! 
( A huge bubble forms next to him. The Doctor covers his face with the kerchief and presses into the corner of the doorway.)

Episode Six

[Outside the Weather Control Bureau]

DOCTOR: Are you in there, Jamie! 
(With the Warrior heading for the entrance, Jamie and Zoe run from their hiding places.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, open the door!

[Weather Control Bureau]

(Jamie and Zoe catch up with the Warrior near the Solar Energy Room. Jamie mouths instructions at Zoe. Sorry, I don't lip read. Zoe hides and Jamie circles round then leaps out in front of the Warrior.) 
JAMIE: Hey! 
(Jamie runs off. The Warrior fires its weapon but he's already gone. Zoe comes out of hiding and runs down another corridor.)

[Outside the Weather Control Bureau]

DOCTOR: Zoe! Jamie! If you're there, let me in! 
(A bubble forms next to him. Again.) 
DOCTOR: Oh no!

[Weather Control Bureau]

DOCTOR [OC]: Jamie, Zoe, open this door! 
(Zoe gets to the main door and starts to unlock it.) 
DOCTOR [OC]: Jamie? Zoe?

[Weather Control Bureau]

(Finally Zoe heaves the door open, and a flood of foam pours in with the Doctor. They get the door closed again.) 
DOCTOR: Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh my word! 
(Zoe pulls him away from the door.) 
DOCTOR: What? Where are we going? 
(In a dry corridor.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, my word. Oh, that was a dangerous situation! 
ZOE: It still is, Doctor. There's an Ice Warrior in the building. 
DOCTOR: What? What about Jamie? 
ZOE: Well, he drew the warrior off so that I could let you in. 
DOCTOR: Oh. no. We must help him. 
ZOE: Oh no, Doctor, this way. 
DOCTOR: What? 
(Jamie leads the Warrior back into the Control room, but there is nowhere to hide. It fires its weapon at him and he dodges around bits of equipment before going through another doorway and shutting it behind him. The Warrior tries to blast its way out. In a corridor - ) 
JAMIE: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
ZOE: Oh Jamie, where's the Ice Warrior? 
JAMIE: Well, I locked him in the room that we were trapped in. 
(They hear the Warrior's weapon firing.) 
DOCTOR: I don't think he's stayed in there, Jamie. Come on! 
(They return to outside the Solar Energy Room.) 
ZOE: Oh look, we could hide in here. 
JAMIE: We'd just be trapped again. 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie, I think this is just the place. 
JAMIE: Why?

[Solar Energy room]

DOCTOR: Solar energy room. That means that's a radiation door. Now, if I can find the control. 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, hurry! 
DOCTOR: It must be here somewhere. 
JAMIE: What do you mean? 
DOCTOR: Ah, wait a minute. 
JAMIE: Is that the one? 
(Jamie throws a switch on the wall and the room goes dark.) 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie! (switches the lights on again) It must be one of these. 
ZOE: Oh hurry, Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Ah! There we are. It's got 'shut' on it. 
(The door closes in the Warrior's face.) 
ZOE: Oh! 
DOCTOR: Get back! 
(The Warrior fires at the door.) 
JAMIE: He's trying to blast his way in! 
DOCTOR: Well, it should hold for a little while, Jamie. 
ZOE: Well, what do we do now? 
DOCTOR: Well, Commander Radnor's sending some security guards. 
JAMIE: A lot of good they'll do against an Ice Warrior. 
ZOE: Solar energy. When we were on the moon, Phipps made a trap. 
DOCTOR: Solar energy. Reflectors, of course! Well, we ought to be able to rig something up here. 
JAMIE: Aye, well, you'd better be quick about it. That shield thing won't hold much longer. 
(A security team is making its way to the Bureau, clearing its path with water sprays. The Warrior has made a scorch mark on the door but that is all. Security reach the Bureau, open the main door and go inside. The Warrior meets them in a corridor and kills the lead two men while the others go down another corridor. The Doctor has been busy with wires, bulbs and two reflectors. Jamie is getting the last of the foam off the Doctor's jacket.) 
DOCTOR: Is this the sort of thing that Phipps rigged up, Zoe? 
ZOE: Well, sort of. It's not quite the same. His was bigger. 
DOCTOR: I think you'll find that this will be better for 
(They hear gunfire outside.) 
JAMIE: They're still shooting out there. They don't stand a chance, though. 
ZOE: Are you nearly ready, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Open the door. 
(The Doctor holds a reflector in each hand.) 
JAMIE: Are you sure that thing works, now? 
DOCTOR: The only way to find out is to try, Jamie. Now open the door. 
(Jamie opens the door.) 
DOCTOR: It's gone. 
JAMIE: Must be chasing after those guards. 
DOCTOR: Another moment and we could have destroyed him. There's some more HD cable there. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
DOCTOR: You reel it out and I'll make the connections. 
JAMIE: What, this? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, that's it, Jamie. Hurry up. 
(Security are trying to lure the Warrior out of the Bureau.) 
DOCTOR: Zoe, stand by to throw the switch. Jamie, play out the cable. 
JAMIE: Right.

[Weather Control Bureau]

(The Doctor heads off down the corridors with his infra red devices, and finally encounters the Warrior.) 
DOCTOR: Now, Zoe! 
(Zoe switches on and the Ice Warrior melts.) 
DOCTOR: All right, Zoe!

[T-Mat Earth Control]

COMPUTER: No information yet available from Weather Control Bureau. 
RADNOR: Oh, no. I'd better get over there. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: T-Mat control? Commander Radnor? Ah. 
RADNOR: Doctor! 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: This is the Doctor. 
RADNOR: Doctor, are you all right? What's happening over there? 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Yes, well, we've had quite a battle here, but things are all right now. There was a warrior here, but we've dealt with him. 
RADNOR: Excellent! Is there much damage? 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Well, yes, I'm afraid so. I'm going to see how much now. How are you getting along with the signal in the satellite? 
RADNOR: Professor Eldred and Miss Kelly are coping with it now. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Good. I'll be back as soon as I can. 
(Transmission ends.) 
RADNOR: How's it going? 
KELLY: We're ready to test. 
RADNOR: Play back recording of homing beam. 
(The computer obeys.) 
KELLY: Now, that's the Ice-Warriors' homing beam. Let's see if I can produce that exactly. 
(But it's too fast and high pitched. She adjusts it with a screwdriver.) 
RADNOR: Oh, can't you get any closer than that? 
KELLY: I shall, don't worry! 
ELDRED: That's it. 
KELLY: I'll lock it to that frequency. 
ELDRED: Just one thing, Miss Kelly. Now that you've perfected this thing, how do you propose getting it to the launching pad without T-Mat? 
KELLY: It just so happens I found a petrol car in a motor museum. 
ELDRED: Really? What make? 
KELLY: I've no idea, but it's got four wheels and it goes. Get this to the vehicle immediately. 
(A technician takes the homing beam away.) 
ELDRED: Will a car be able to get through the foam? 
RADNOR: Yes. I've arranged for a route to be cleared by hosing the foam. 
ELDRED: Good, good. 
RADNOR: But the only way we'll ever get rid of it permanently is by rain. Lots of rain!

[Weather Control Room]

JAMIE: It's hopeless, Doctor. You'll never get that thing going again. 
DOCTOR: I'm not so sure, Jamie. After all, it's only the controls that are damaged. The workings are all right. If we can bypass the controls. Have you got your knife on you? 
JAMIE: Eh? Aye. 
DOCTOR: Lend it me, will you? 
JAMIE: Be careful with this. 
DOCTOR: That's it, thank you. 
(The Doctor uses the sgian dubh to get inside the workings of the weather control unit.) 
DOCTOR: There we are. Now, what have we got here? Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, well, it's just a question of sorting this lot out, that's all.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

MARSHALL [on monitor]: You should not have killed him. Who will operate T-Mat? 
SLAAR: I have studied the controls. 
MARSHALL [on monitor]: What if the apparatus breaks down? 
SLAAR: I shall send warriors to Earth to bring back technicians. 
MARSHALL [on monitor]: Soon all humans on Earth will be extinct. 
SLAAR: It will take time for the fungus to remove the oxygen from their atmosphere. 
MARSHALL [on monitor]: You must use that time to obtain another human, and do not kill him. 
SLAAR: No, Grand Marshall. 
MARSHALL [on monitor]: You will be prepared to activate the homing beam on our signal? 
SLAAR: All is prepared, Grand Marshall. 
(Transmission ends.) 
SLAAR: I shall return to our ship to finalise invasion plans.

[Weather Control Room]

DOCTOR: Right, now then, Zoe, let's see what happens when we try to connect these two together. (they spark.) No, I don't think so, somehow. What about these two? (no sparks so he twists the ends together) Ah, that's better. I think I've succeeded in re-establishing one of these rain circuits, Jamie. 
(Jamie is up on a cat walk looking out of the window.) 
JAMIE: It's not raining yet. 
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie. Weather control is a very difficult technology. You can't expect immediate results. 
ZOE: Are you sure you're getting it right, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well, I hope so, Zoe. Just have to hope for the best, that's all. I must get on because there's another little job that I want to do. 
JAMIE: Have you not got enough to do already? 
ZOE: What else is there? 
DOCTOR: Well, I want to make some alterations to my solar energy device.

[T-Mat Earth Control]

MAN [OC]: Lift off in five seconds from now. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Zero. 
(The rocket lifts off. The Doctor with his infra-red lamps, Zoe and Jamie enter.) 
DOCTOR: With any luck, we should have some nice heavy rain before long. Ah, there we are. 
KELLY: Yes, the satellite. 
ELDRED: Isn't that a beautiful sight? 
KELLY: We finished and installed the homing device. It's working perfectly. 
DOCTOR: Well done. 
KELLY: Doctor? DOCTOR: Yes, Miss Kelly? 
KELLY: I know we're sending up a false signal, but aren't some of the Martian ships bound to follow the right one? 
DOCTOR: There isn't going to be a right one. There's only going to be ours, the wrong one, and that's going to lead the entire Martian fleet into an orbit around the sun. 
ZOE: What about Slaar's signal? 
DOCTOR: Oh, obviously that has to be stopped. 
ELDRED: But how? 
DOCTOR: Well, as soon as the satellite is up, I shall T-Mat myself to the moon and destroy their homing device. 
KELLY: They'll kill you on sight. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so. I've rigged up a rather interesting little device here. 
KELLY: What's it for? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's a development of the solar energy device that you so successfully used on the moon, only I've succeeded in rendering it portable. I've got a solar battery. 
(The satellite has been deployed and is transmitting.) 
KELLY: Well, there it is. It's in orbit. We're now picking up the alien's homing signal from the moon. DOCTOR: Well, that means that their invasion fleet is getting closer. There's not time to be lost. Now, are you quite clear? As soon as I have succeeded in destroying their signal you must activate our signal in the satellite. 
RADNOR: Oh, we'll be ready. 
DOCTOR: Right, then I'll be off. 
ZOE: Oh Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes? What is it, Zoe? 
ZOE: You will be careful, won't you? 
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Zoe, I will. Are you ready, Miss Kelly? 
KELLY: But Doctor, our control of T-Mat hasn't been tested. 
DOCTOR: Then now's the time to test it.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

(It works. The only Warrior there has its back to the T-Mat cubicle. The Doctor sneaks out of the cubicle, the Warrior turns and the Doctor uses the solar projectors on it. The Doctor puts down his device and starts fiddling with the Slaar's communication device. Another Warrior enters with Slaar. The Doctor surrenders.) 
SLAAR: No. 
(The Warrior lowers its weapon.) 
SLAAR: You, over there. I ordered you to be destroyed! 
DOCTOR: Well, you weren't very successful, were you. 
SLAAR: Destroy that weapon. 
(The warrior fires.) 
SLAAR: What is your purpose in coming here? 
DOCTOR: Well, you don't expect me to tell you that, do you? 
SLAAR: The directional beam is still operative. 
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm afraid you were a little too quick for me. 
SLAAR: Are you capable of operating the T-Mat mechanism? 
DOCTOR: Oh no, I don't think I could 
(Slaar gestures the Warrior to shoot the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: Well, well yes, perhaps I could get the hang of it. 
SLAAR: As long as you can be useful to us, you can live. But this time there will be no escape. You will familiarise yourself with the T-Mat controls. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much. 
SLAAR: You will not touch the controls until I give the order.

[T-Mat Earth Control]

KELLY: It's operating perfectly. 
RADNOR: Good! 
ELDRED: Shouldn't we have waited until the Doctor got back? 
RADNOR: The moon signal has disappeared, hasn't it? 
ELDRED: It may be purely atmospheric. For all we know they're still transmitting as strong as ever. 
ZOE: The moon signal was strong enough before the Doctor left. He must have succeeded. 
JAMIE: Then why hasn't he come back?

[T Mat Moonbase Control]

MARSHALL [on monitor]: We are receiving your homing signal clearly. Soon we shall enter the gravitational field of the moon. 
SLAAR: All is prepared, Grand Marshall. I have obtained the services of another human. He will T-Mat our warriors to Earth. 
MARSHALL [on monitor]: Good. I shall resume transmission when landing is imminent. 
(Transmission ends.) 
SLAAR: When our warriors arrive, you will transmit them to Earth under my direction. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but they haven't arrived yet, have they. Something still might go wrong, you know. 
SLAAR: Nothing can go wrong now. 
DOCTOR: There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip. 
SLAAR: If anything does go wrong, you will be the first to die.

[T-Mat Earth Control]

(The invasion fleet is on radar.) 
RADNOR: Scan closer! 
KELLY: If they are going to divert, if should happen any moment now. 
ZOE: Look, they're changing course. 
RADNOR: I think you're right. 
ELDRED: Yes, they're all following the satellite signal. 
RADNOR: Then the Doctor must have succeeded. He must have turned off the Martian signal. 
JAMIE: Well, what's happening up there, then? Why hasn't he come back? 
RADNOR: Don't worry, Jamie. A squad of security guards armed with flamethrowers are on their way here now, and as soon as they get here we'll T-Mat them to the moon. 
JAMIE: Oh, they'll be too late. 
RADNOR: You'll just have to be patient! 
JAMIE: Och, I'm sick of being patient! 
(Jamie takes Zoe aside and whispers.) 
JAMIE: Zoe. That T-Mat thing. Do you know how it works? 
ZOE: I think so. Why? 
JAMIE: Could you T-Mat me back to the moon? 
ZOE: Oh, now Jamie, surely 
JAMIE: Look, either the Doctor's all right, in which case we've no need to worry, or he's in danger and he needs my help.

[T Mat Moonbase Control]  

MARSHALL [on monitor]: Slaar! We are passing between Earth and moon! The signal has not led us into the moon's gravitational field! 
SLAAR: Have you lost my signal? 
MARSHALL [on monitor]: Your signal is being received clearly, but we are off course. 
SLAAR: Are you sure your calculations are correct? 
MARSHALL [on monitor]: Our calculations have been checked. You have sent us into an orbit close to the sun! 
SLAAR: Use your retro-active rockets to change course! 
MARSHALL [on monitor]: It is too late. We have insufficient fuel for manoeuvre. You have failed us, Slaar! We shall all die! We are being drawn into the orbit of the sun! 
(Transmission ends.) 
SLAAR: This is impossible! 
(Slaar checks the communications device.) 
SLAAR: The signal. There is no power. You did this. 
DOCTOR: Yes. That signal has been going no further than this control room. 
SLAAR: But they were receiving my signal. 
DOCTOR: Not your signal. Ours. 
SLAAR: You sent a signal from Earth? 
DOCTOR: We sent up a satellite. That signal has sent your fleet into a false orbit. 
SLAAR: The heat of the sun will kill them! You have destroyed our entire fleet! 
DOCTOR: You tried to destroy an entire world. 
SLAAR: Earth will still die. The fungus will take the oxygen from your atmosphere. 
DOCTOR: No, I'm afraid that you've failed there too. We can destroy the fungus. 
SLAAR: Kill him! 
(A voice calls out from the T-Mat cubicle.) 
JAMIE: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Jamie, look out! 
(The Doctor leaps over the T-Mat control desk and tackles the Warrior. He diverts its aim so that Slaar dies instead of Jamie. Jamie runs across the room and leaps on the Warrior.) 
JAMIE: Creag an tuire! 
(The Doctor holds up his solar energy power leads.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, a live terminal! 
(Jamie and the Doctor each press the leads into the Warrior's body. There is a bright flash and the Warrior collapses.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, well done, Jamie! Oh, goodness me! Jamie, thank you very much. Now then, we must T-Mat ourselves back to Earth.

[T-Mat Earth Control]

(Where a heavy thunderstorm is washing away the foam.) 
COMPUTER: Wide spread rainfall throughout the country. Some flooding but none serious. Fungus rapidly disappearing. Weather Control Bureau coming back into operation. World food shortages partially relieved now T-Mat becoming operational again. Message to Commander Radnor from the Security Council of the United Nations. Congratulations. 
RADNOR: All right, discontinue report. 
ZOE: So you really did know what you were doing at the Weather Control Bureau. 
DOCTOR: But, Zoe, of course I did! 
JAMIE: Aye, well, it took long enough to work, eh? 
RADNOR: Well, the rain seems to have disposed of the fungus well enough. Now the next thing to do is to get T-Mat fully operational again. 
KELLY: Yes, when moon relay's repaired we must check over the equipment and build in safeguards. From now on T-Mat must be entirely controlled from Earth. 
ELDRED: Oh, surely you've learned not to put all of your eggs in one basket in future? 
KELLY: T-Mat in itself is perfectly effective. 
ELDRED: You need a secondary transportation system. A fleet of rockets on permanent standby. 
RADNOR: Yes, but Professor Eldred, we 
KELLY: There's no need to go to those lengths. 
ELDRED: It's a question of common sense. I'm sure the Doctor will agree with me. Doctor. 
(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe are not there.)

[Space museum]

JAMIE: Did you have to make it rain as hard as all that? 
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie, sometimes I think you're never satisfied. 
ZOE: What did you rush us back here for? 
DOCTOR: Well, you know, questions, explanations. It's very difficult. Come on. 
(The Doctor enters the Tardis.) 
ZOE: Oh, where are going now? 
JAMIE: Oh, it's no good asking him. He's no more idea than the man in the moon. 
DOCTOR: I heard that, Jamie. Come on. 
(They all get into the Tardis, and it dematerialises.)

[Beacon Alpha One airlock]

(Far out in space hangs a segmented structure built solely to receive and transmit data across the space ways. A black dart-shaped craft approaches it and docks. Three men carry boxes of equipment into the beacon. Outside the beacon, two space-walkers attach magnetic charges its hull and finally a rocket propulsion unit.) 
CAVEN: Dervish! Dervish! 
DERVISH: (a thin man) We've nearly finished. 
CAVEN: About time. 
DERVISH: My men are just coming. We'll detonate by radio beam. 
CAVEN: Right. Hurry it up. 
(All the men return to the ship. It undocks and moves away. Shortly afterwards a radio signal is sent and beacon Alpha One goes KaBOOM!)

[V-Ship flight deck]

(Another ship is travelling through space. This one is thin and wide, with military insignia V41-LO. The flight deck is split into an upper command bridge with silver-haired General Hermack in charge, and a lower technical area.) 
HERMACK: Everything all right, Penn? 
(played by Jack May) 
PENN: Fine, sir. 
(The young George Layton with a zapata moustache.) 
HERMACK: Fine. 
WARNE: (American) You sent for me, sir? 
HERMACK: Ah yes, Ian. Sit down. 
WARNE: Thank you. 
HERMACK: Any information on that beacon signal yet? 
WARNE: No, sir. There's been no response to the secondary emergency circuits. either. 
HERMACK: No, there wouldn't be. 
WARNE: Sir? 
HERMACK: What do you think has happened to that beacon? 
WARNE: Well, it's difficult to say, sir. It could be a failure in the solar energy store. 
HERMACK: No. The emergency power would operate and we'd get a may day signal. 
WARNE: Well. Oh, you don't think this is a mechanical failure, sir? 
HERMACK: No. No, I don't. These beacons are practically fool proof. 
WARNE: You got any ideas? 
HERMACK: Yes, I have. And I must be right. Argonite! These beacons are almost entirely constructed of argonite. 
WARNE: Of course, sir. What are you going to do about it? 
HERMACK: Attention all personnel. This is General Hermack. Your V-ship is now fifty days and many billions of miles out from Earth. You're entering the fourth sector of our galaxy. In this sector for some time now, Earth Government has been aware that a highly organised gang of criminals have been roaming the space ways, and preying upon defenceless cargo ships. The main target of these criminals is argonite, the most valuable mineral known to man and so far only found on the planets of the Fourth Sector. A government space beacon marking the approaches to the planet New Sarum has ceased transmitting its navigation signal. These beacons, as you know, are constructed of argonite. It is my belief that the criminals are attacking the government navigation beacons and plundering the argonite. There can be no other explanation for its failure. This being the case, I have decided to abandon our present mission and to investigate the missing beacon in the New Sarum sector. I want all section commanders on the bridge at twenty hundred hours sector four solar time. Resume normal duties until then. 
WARNE: There are eighteen space beacons quite scattered across this sector, sir. 
HERMACK: Seventeen, Ian, until the one at New Sarum's replaced. 
WARNE: Seventeen. And they're millions of miles apart. So how can we be sure which one the pirates are likely to attack next? 
HERMACK: We can't. 
WARNE: Well, exactly. The odds are seventeen to one against us being in the right place at the right time. 
HERMACK: Ah! With our speed, I think we can cut those odds a bit. Now, there are four beacons in the Pliny solar system here. That is where we'll start our patrol.

[Beacon Alpha Seven]

(There is a dart-shaped craft docked to this beacon now. It is the same routine as at Alpha One.) 
CAVEN: Come on! Speed it up. 
DERVISH: Caven, I don't like this. 
CAVEN: Nobody's asking you to like it. Just get those scissor charges laid into position. 
DERVISH: If we attack any more beacons, we'll have the whole of the Interstellar Space Corps in this sector. 
CAVEN: Look, as of this moment, the Space Corps has its hands full of trouble. Bush fire wars in three different sectors. There's never been a better time for getting rich. 
DERVISH: Right, lads. Now, we'll lay four charges along the main axis, then we'll attach booster charges around the hull. Okay. 
CAVEN: You're a good engineer, Dervish. Just do your job and leave the Space Corps to me, eh? 
DERVISH: Okay. But I worked ten years for Earth Government. 
CAVEN: You should've stayed with them. They'd have given you a pension. 
DERVISH: Attacking Government property is one crime they make sure never pays. 
CAVEN: Sixteen hundred tons of pure argonite pays all right, Dervish. To me this is like a floating bank. 
(The charges are laid.)

[V-Ship flight deck]

WARNE: What range are the forward scanners set for, Penn? 
PENN: Fifteen hundred, sir. 
WARNE: Well reset them at two thousand. Right? 
PENN: Very good, sir. 
WARNE: And keep a sharp eye on that screen. There are lots of rogue asteroids in the Pliny system. 
HERMACK: Oh, and one thing more. Make sure the Minnow ships are fully fuelled, and put the detonation heads on their missiles. Report back as soon as that is done. 
WARNE: We're approaching the Pliny system now, sir. We've made scanner contact with the four beacons. They're functioning normally. 
HERMACK: Ah good. Now this planet Ta, here, is the main one in the system. We'll orbit here for a few weeks and see what happens. 
WARNE: So that's Ta, huh? 
HERMACK: You've heard of it? 
WARNE: Yeah. It's the head quarters of the Issigri Mining Corporation. The most productive planet in the entire galaxy. 
HERMACK: Madeleine Issigri has built quite a place there. Which is one reason for basing ourselves in the Pliny system. 
WARNE: Why's that a reason, sir? 
HERMACK: Well, if we're out here long, Ian, the men will need somewhere for rest and recreation. Deep space sickness is the one thing we can't chance. 
PENN: Major Warne. 
WARNE: What is it, Penn? 
PENN: I've got a contact, sir, at beacon Alpha Seven. 
WARNE: Well, hold on it. Any identification? 
PENN: No, sir. Too far away. 
HERMACK: Ah, it's a space ship right enough. Check Central Flight Information, Ian, and see if anyone should be out there. 
WARNE: Right, sir. 
HERMACK: Change course for beacon Alpha Seven. Bridge to Power Room, I want ten seconds main boost. 
WARNE: According to Flight Information, sir, there should be no ships in the area within the next seventeen days. 
HERMACK: Well, whoever they are, they've not yet reported to Central Flight Information. 
WARNE: Do you think it's the pirates? 
HERMACK: Yes, it could be. Though some of these commercial flights don't always like to report their whereabouts, for reasons of their own. Anyway, we shall soon know. (Meanwhile, the pirate ship undocks from Alpha Seven.) 
PENN: She's backing off, sir. 
HERMACK: Keep track of her. 
PENN: She's moving quite fast, sir. 
WARNE: Got a good turn of speed for a commercial. 
HERMACK: Is beacon Alpha Seven still functioning? 
WARNE: Yes, sir. Very strong signal. 
HERMACK: Well, that's something. 
WARNE: Maybe they were just picking up emergency supplies, sir. Some of these beacons do carry reserve medical and oxygen equipment. 
PENN: Sir, I've got another signal coming in now. It's a UHF! 
WARNE: UHF? But that's reserved for demolition teams. 
HERMACK: Well, put it on audio. 
PENN: Yes, sir. 
(Beacon Alpha Seven explodes.) 
PENN: Alpha Seven's broken up, sir. 
HERMACK: Ah. Right under our noses. Main boost. 
PENN: Lost the beacon, sir. No more signal. 
WARNE: No, there won't be. It's probably in a dozen separate bits by now. 
HERMACK: Keep full contact with that pirate ship. 
PENN: Yes, sir. 
HERMACK: At least we can be sure they don't get away. Ian, give me a projected arrival time. 
WARNE: Three hours, sir. Maybe I can get a visual on the main scanner. 
(The pirate ship appears on the viewscreen, towing beacon debris.) 
WARNE: There she is sir. And that's what's left of the beacon. 
HERMACK: We've got them cold, Ian. We'll be onto them long before they get rid of that salvaged scrap. 
WARNE: Yeah, providing she doesn't see us approaching, sir. 
HERMACK: They don't know 
PENN: That ship looks fast 
HERMACK: They don't know we're in the same area. What's wrong with the scanner? 
WARNE: Seem to be losing visual contact, sir. 
PENN: The ship's moving away, sir. 
HERMACK: What? 
PENN: Just started to go, and the beacon debris's going with her. 
HERMACK: Hold that contact, Penn. 
PENN: It's no good, sir. She's going too fast. 
HERMACK: They must have twice our speed! 
WARNE: Maybe the Minnows could hold her? 
HERMACK: Not at this distance. They haven't the fuel. 
PENN: Lost contact, sir. 
HERMACK: Oh, hold the same course. 
PENN: Sir. 
HERMACK: Keep searching. 
WARNE: They must have attached rocket units to the beacon, sir, the way it moved off. 
HERMACK: Yes. They're very well organised. They cut the beacon into several manageable pieces by means of scissor charges, then shoot the bits off to some pre-arranged collection point. Very clever. 
WARNE: And quick. It cuts down the time they're at risk. And they just burn out the Argonite at their leisure. 
HERMACK: Ian, we shall have to rethink our tactics. We shall never catch them by normal patrol methods. 
WARNE: What else can we do, sir? 
HERMACK: Man the beacons. 
WARNE: Man them? 
HERMACK: It's the only answer. We'll drop small parties of four or five men on each beacon and give them rations and supplies for two months. Well, all these mark five beacons were designed as emergency survival centres. 
WARNE: Yes sir, but I don't think anybody has ever tried living on them. Some of these beacons are pretty primitive. 
HERMACK: I'm not interested in men's comfort, Major. Set course for the nearest beacon. 
WARNE: Yes, sir.

[Beacon Alpha Four]

(A Lieutenant and four armed guards enter the beacon with survival packs. Warne follows.) 
WARNE: Here's your radio, Lieutenant. It's beamed automatically to main control. All you have to do in the event of trouble is press this button, right? 
SORBA: (Dark) Don't worry, I'll press it. 
WARNE: Remember your main job here is to give us the earliest possible warning in the event of the pirate ship approaching, right? 
SORBA: And after that, we fight them. 
WARNE: After that, I think you'll have to, Joe. Good Luck. 
SORBA: Thank you. 
WARNE: See you in about six weeks. 
SORBA: I hope.

[V-Ship flight deck]

HERMACK: Set a course for Alpha Nine. 
PENN: Very good, sir. 
WARNE: I told Lieutenant Sorba we'd be back in about six weeks. sir. 
HERMACK: Or much earlier if the pirates raid Alpha Four. How's morale on the picket? 
WARNE: Oh, it's pretty high, sir. I think they're hoping for the chance of a party. 
HERMACK: They understand they have to shoot on sight? 
WARNE: Yes, sir, I told them. No, anybody poking their nose aboard Alpha Four will find plenty of trouble waiting for him.

[Beacon Alpha Four]

(And with those words, the Tardis materialises in the beacon's computer bay. The soldiers are on the level below.) 
SORBA: Now we're going to be here for about six weeks. Settle down and keep your eyes open. Take care about 
GUARD: Sir. 
SORBA: What? What are you doing here? Why aren't you in the observation tower? 
GUARD: There's something in the computer bay, sir. 
SORBA: Something? Well, what do you mean by that? 
GUARD: I heard something in there, sir. A noise. 
SORBA: All right, we'd better check it out then. Come on.

[Beacon Alpha Four computer bay]

DOCTOR: Oh dear. 
ZOE: What's wrong? 
DOCTOR: Well, I don't think we're quite where I expected. Never mind. This looks very interesting. 
JAMIE: Interesting? A piece of old machinery? 
DOCTOR: Yes. I've never seen a computer quite like this before, Jamie. 
ZOE: It looks like some sort of control room. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but what does it control? 
JAMIE: Yeah. Well I think we'd better get out of here before somebody catches us. 
ZOE: Good idea. There's a door here. 
JAMIE: No, Zoe. I meant in the Tardis. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, stop worrying. There's obviously nobody here. 
JAMIE: Well, how do you know that? 
DOCTOR: Well, this machine is programmed to operate by itself. 
ZOE: Yes, but what does it do? 
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not sure Zoe, but I think we're on an unmanned spacecraft in a fixed orbit. We're too far away from anywhere to be a weather satellite. Let's see what clues we can find through here, shall we? 
JAMIE: What's that? 
DOCTOR: What? (A floor panel lifts and Sorba starts shooting as the Doctor, Zoe and Jamie run out of the room.)

[Beacon Alpha Four companionway]

JAMIE: Nobody here, eh? 
ZOE: Now what are we going to do? The Tardis is in there. 
DOCTOR: There's only one thing we can do. 
ZOE: What? 
DOCTOR: Run! 
JAMIE: Well, maybe next time you'll listen to me. 
ZOE: If there is a next time.

[Beacon Alpha Four computer bay]

SORBA: All right, there are only three of them and they can't get away. Hunt them down and don't forget. Shoot to kill.

[Beacon Alpha Four airlock]

(The pirates have arrived.) 
CAVEN: Alpha Four. Another present from the home planet's tax payers. 
DERVISH: Same procedure as last time? 
CAVEN: Yes, Dervish. But now that you've had a little practice, get those scissor charges laid a bit quicker, eh? 
(Energy weapons fire.) 
DERVISH: Hey, what's that? Caven, those were blaster guns! 
CAVEN: Get the crew in here at the double.

[Beacon Alpha Four]

(Our heroes run along companionways sealing the hatches behind them.) 
JAMIE: Are you all right, Zoe? 
ZOE: Yes, I think so. 
DOCTOR: That should hold them for a little while. 
ZOE: But why are they trying to kill us? We haven't done anything. 
JAMIE: No. 
DOCTOR: I don't know, but we're certainly not stopping to find out. 
JAMIE: What's that? Look. 
(A welding torch is cutting through the hatch.) 
DOCTOR: Come on. Let's find somewhere else to hide. 
(They go further on and secure another hatch.) 
JAMIE: Doctor, there's no way out of here. 
DOCTOR: What? 
JAMIE: Look! 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, what can we do? 
DOCTOR: Well, I don't know. If we go down there we'll bump straight into them. I'm afraid we're trapped. 
(Sorba's men have cut through the first hatch.) 
SORBA: All right, this way. 
(The pirates shoot the soldiers in the back. Sorba is shot and he falls while pressing the call button on his radio.)

[V-Ship flight deck]

PENN: Thirty minutes from beacon Alpha Three, sir. 
HERMACK: Right. Warn the picket to stand by on C deck, Ian. 
WARNE: Right, sir. 
PENN: Emergency from Beacon Alpha Four, sir! 
WARNE: Sorba's being attacked. 
HERMACK: Set course for Alpha Four. Try and get me a visual on the scanner, Ian. 
PENN: On course, sir. 
HERMACK: Bridge to Power House. I want main boost for as long as you can hold it without vapourising the motors.

[Beacon Alpha Four companionway]

CAVEN: This one's still alive. 
DERVISH: So the Space Corps were too busy to bother about us, eh? 
CAVEN: Shut up! I'm thinking. 
DERVISH: There's no time for thinking. We've got to get out of here. 
CAVEN: Four space Guards and an officer. What are they doing here? 
DERVISH: There must be a cruiser in the area. 
CAVEN: Not a big enough crew to defend the beacon but they must have been put on board for a reason. 
(Caven sees a box lying beside Sorba.) 
CAVEN: What's this? 
DERVISH: It looks like a fixed beam transmitter. Why, that's it. Well, they'll be on their way back here by now. 
CAVEN: Then you'd better get moving. 
DERVISH: Well, you don't still want the beacon cutting up? 
CAVEN: That's what we came here to do. 
DERVISH: Think about it! 
CAVEN: Don't waste time. Get on with it. 
(Caven shoots the transmitter.)

[V-Ship flight deck]

WARNE: Could be their radio's packed up, sir. 
HERMACK: Yes. Give me a projected arrival time. 
WARNE: Two hours twenty minutes. 
HERMACK: I should have left a stronger picket. 
WARNE: Oh no, sir. We haven't the man power. Besides Sorba knew he could only hope to delay things. 
HERMACK: I am going to get that gang of murdering thieves if I have to spend the next ten years out here.

[Beacon Alpha Four companionway]

(Sorba wakes.) 
CAVEN: Yes, Lieutenant, you're the last of the toy soldiers. 
SORBA: Shot in the back. 
CAVEN: You mean we're disqualified. You don't want to play any more? 
SORBA: You can laugh now, but you won't get away with this. 
CAVEN: Who's going to stop me, Lieutenant? 
SORBA: How did you get those decoys aboard? 
CAVEN: Decoys? 
SORBA: Those three that lead us into your ambush. 
CAVEN: Concussion, lieutenant? Or stalling for time? 
SORBA: You know who I'm talking about. They ran off into the aft companionway. 
CAVEN: None of my men down there. Must be some of yours. 
SORBA: Sure. We were having a private training session with loaded thermite guns. 
CAVEN: We did hear firing in the airlock. You mean there really is someone else in there? 
SORBA: I thought you'd planted them there. 
CAVEN: Whoever they are, we've got no time to bother with them now. 
DERVISH: I've laid the charges. Just fixing the rockets. 
CAVEN: Good. If he can walk, get him out of here. If he can't, leave him. 
(Caven shoots the lock of the hatch.) 
DERVISH: What are you doing? 
CAVEN: Just sealing a coffin, Dervish.

[Beacon Alpha Four compartment].

(On the other side of the hatch.) 
JAMIE: I wish I could hear what they're saying. 
ZOE: I think they're trying to burn through it. 
DOCTOR: Just a minute. I think they've gone away. 
ZOE: I don't understand. Why didn't they come in here after us? 
JAMIE: Aye, they must've known we were trapped. Why not finish us off? 
DOCTOR: They didn't seem very friendly, did they? Oh! 
JAMIE: What's the matter? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's hot. You try. 
JAMIE: Ah. No, thank you. 
ZOE: I told you they were trying to burn through it. 
JAMIE: Well, why haven't they? 
(They hear a clang.) 
ZOE: What's that? 
(Another clang.) 
DOCTOR: There's something moving out there. 
ZOE: It sounds as if somebody's on the hull. 
(The pirates are fastening the charges and propulsion units.) 
JAMIE: What are they doing? 
DOCTOR: I don't know Jamie. Perhaps they're cleaning the windows. 
JAMIE: Oh. Eh? 
ZOE: Look, why don't we sneak back to the Tardis and get out of here? 
JAMIE: Aye, while we've still got the chance. 
DOCTOR: A sensible idea, Zoe. You're sure there's nobody out there? 
ZOE: I haven't heard anybody for ages. Come on. 
DOCTOR: Mind out, it's hot. 
ZOE: Well, it's not hot any more. 
DOCTOR: What? 
ZOE: I can't unlock it. 
JAMIE: Let me do it, Zoe. You'll have to eat more porridge. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, I don't think it's any use. You know what I think they've done? 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: They've welded the lock! We're prisoners! 
(The pirate ship leaves the beacon.)

[V-Ship flight deck]

PENN: They're leaving beacon Alpha Four, sir. 
WARNE: It's exactly what happened before. 
HERMACK: What is our arrival time? 
PENN: Still ninety minutes to go, sir. 
HERMACK: We are going to be too late again! 
WARNE: The beacon should blow any second now. 
(KaBOOM! The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe are sent flying across their sealed compartment.)

Episode Two

From the Lost In Time DVD

[V-Ship flight deck]

HERMACK: Penn, give me a bearing on that pirate ship. 
PENN: I can't pick her up, sir. 
HERMACK: What? 
PENN: The debris from that beacon's jammed the signals. 
HERMACK: Oh Penn, you are an incompetent, useless 
WARNE: Keep trying, Penn. 
PENN: Yes, sir. 
(Warne joins Hermack at the coffee machine at the side of the bridge section.) 
HERMACK: Ah, coffee? 
WARNE: Yes please, sir. Thank you. 
HERMACK: All right, I know. The men are doing their best. 
WARNE: General? 
HERMACK: Isn't that what you were going to say? 
WARNE: Something like that, yeah. 
HERMACK: You see? They're moving out of range already. 
WARNE: If only we could have sustained continual main boost, it might have been a different story. They must have a base somewhere in this system. We're more than fifty days out from home planet. 
HERMACK: Quite. They can have main boost the whole time. Our only chance is getting close enough to launch the Minnows. 
WARNE: Or locate their base. They must have dispatched pieces of that beacon to it. If we could just locate one of the pieces. 
HERMACK: Can't be done. If those auxiliary rockets cut out, we've nowhere to track on. You see? There's nothing left now. 
WARNE: We've got the tactile scanner, sir. 
HERMACK: That would be like looking for a single speck of dust at the bottom of an argonite mine. 
WARNE: Do you think there's any chance they're still alive out there? 
HERMACK: You mean Sorba's men? 
WARNE: Yeah. 
HERMACK: I doubt it. I doubt if anyone's alive on that beacon now. 
(As the sections of the beacon float along in formation, three figures lie unconscious in the rearmost one.) 
PENN: Major Warne! 
WARNE: What is it, Penn? 
PENN: Rocket ship, sir. 
WARNE: Are you sure? 
PENN: No doubt of it, sir, and she's right in the area where beacon Alpha Four went up. 
WARNE: Right, can I get it on the TS? 
PENN: We should be able to, sir. Bearing starboard nineteen from SDC. 
WARNE: Nineteen SDC. 
HERMACK: What is it, Ian? 
WARNE: Something on the radar, sir. 
HERMACK: The pirates? 
WARNE: Well, if it is, there's something wrong with their ship. She's hardly moving. 
HERMACK: But they don't even know we're in the same area. 
WARNE: Oh I don't know, sir. They must be aware that there's a V-ship in the system. They ran into our picket on Alpha Four. Which is why. somehow, I don't think this could be their ship. 
HERMACK: But according to flight information, there should be nothing in this solar system for the next eighty hours. 
(Warne gets an image on a rear monitor.) 
WARNE: There she is, sir. And that isn't the ship we saw before. 
HERMACK: No, it isn't. Can you get a closer shot? 
WARNE: That's one of the old C-class freighters, sir. I didn't know they were still flying.

[LIZ 79]

(This ship is homely, with a jacket slung over the back of the captain's chair. A hot hard-boiled bell rings and an egg drops out of a dispenser chute. A space cowboy in checked shirt and neckerchief enters singing 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'. Think the sort of character Gabby Hayes used to play. He puts the egg in an egg cup and sits in his chair with the full breakfast tray on his lap. Smoke comes out of a toaster. He throws away the charcoal offering.) 
MILO: The last of me nutty sliced bread. Rubbishy new-fangled solar toasters! 
(The lights go dim. He thumps a panel and they come up again.) 
MILO: Ah. That's better. 
(Just as he is taking the top off his egg, the Call light flashes. Milo puts on a headset.) 
HERMACK [OC]: This is V forty one. V forty one calling LIZ seventy nine. LIZ seven nine, can you hear me? 
MILO: LIZ seventy nine. LIZ seventy nine. I can hear you, V forty one. Go away! 
HERMACK [OC]: What? Now listen. This is General Nikolai Hermack. Commander of the Space First Division. Give me your identity registration. 
MILO: A general, a real general. Oh, General, why don't you take yourself off? I'm trying to have my breakfast.

[V-Ship flight deck]

HERMACK: LIZ seventy nine, give me your identity registration. That is an order. 
MILO [OC]: Oh come on, General, I lost that thing about thirty years ago. Why don't you go about your business and leave me alone. 
(Warne gets the data up on a monitor.) 
WARNE: That's LIZ seventy nine's registration, sir. She's a real old-timer. She's been afloat for about forty years. 
HERMACK: Milo Clancey! I might have known. 
WARNE: You know him, sir? 
HERMACK: Of him. Out in Reja Magnum, where I did my first tour, he was something of a legend. Milo Clancey! I have your identity registration here. 
MILO [OC]: I'm very glad for you, General. That's great work. That's very good. Now, good day. 
HERMACK: Listen, Clancey. Where are you from and where are you bound?

[LIZ 79]

MILO: Might I ask, General, what in tarnations business that might be of yours? 
HERMACK [OC]: Clancey, I'm coming alongside with a boarding party. I warn you, don't try and resist. 
MILO: I won't tangle with you, General. You come on in and join the party. Oh, and mind you don't scratch your nice shiny white paint.

[Beacon Alpha Four compartment]

(The Doctor wakes, and shakes Jamie.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, Jamie. 
(The Doctor drags one of a pair of gas cylinders over to Zoe and Jamie.)

[V-Ship flight deck]

WARNE: I've sent a guard aboard, sir, to pick up Clancey. I don't think he'll give us any trouble. 
HERMACK: Yes. Well, he won't co-operate though. Ian, have you ever run across any of these old-timers? 
WARNE: No, sir. 
HERMACK: They think they're a law unto themselves. They don't like the Space Corps either. 
WARNE: Why? 
HERMACK: Well, these old mining prospectors like Clancey were the first men to go out into deep space. For a time they had the place to themselves, roaming the spaceways, looking for planets, jumping each other's claims. They were a wild breed, Ian, and they learned to live without the law. 
IAN: And then the Space Corps came along and started to enforce law and order, right? 
HERMACK: Yes, much to their resentment. Clancey must be the last of the type. 
(Milo enters.) 
MILO: My, my, my. Well, they certainly do you slickers proud, don't they. It's like a whole floating fun palace up here. 
HERMACK: Clancey, I am General Hermack. 
MILO: Howdy! 
HERMACK: And this is Major Warne, my ADC. 
MILO: Major? 
HERMACK: What are you doing in this system and why you are not on feedback to Central Flight Information? 
MILO: Oh, am I not, General? 
HERMACK: No. 
MILO: Oh, no, you're right. You're right. I remember now. That old feedback of mine, it just sort of fell to bits about five year ago now. 
HERMACK: Five years? 
MILO: Or could it be ten? Yep. Certainly could be ten. I've been always meaning to get that thing fixed. 
WARNE: You know it's an offence to operate without a feedback to CFI? 
MILO: An offence? 
WARNE: Right. 
MILO: I didn't realise that, sonny, no. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. There are so many offences these days. 
HERMACK: Clancey, what are you doing in this system? 
MILO: Well, I am the head of the Milo Clancey Space Mining Company. 
HERMACK: Yes, we know all about that. We have your identity registration here. 
MILO: Oh, that must be great for you, General, to have all of those facts at your fingertips like that. 
HERMACK: Get to the point, Clancey. 
MILO: You would know the point if you'd been reading my reports I've been sending to you the last two years. 
WARNE: What do you mean? 
MILO: Argonite pirates, that's what I mean, sonny. 
HERMACK: Go on, Clancey. 
MILO: Over the last two years, I have lost five floaters carrying argonite ore back to home planet. They were hijacked, General, and they were brought into this system. 
WARNE: You reported this, you say? 
MILO: Ah, aye, I reported this, sonny. About a dozen times I reported it but it didn't do me any good, did it. So I said to myself, all right, all righty, I'll just have to do something about this myself. 
HERMACK: How much argonite did you have on each floater? 
MILO: I had a full load. Fifty thousand tons unrefined ore. 
WARNE: What makes you so sure your floaters were bought into this system? 
MILO: Time, sonny, time. This system is the closest to where they left the spaceway. And my old floaters, they've got no propulsion units. They're unmanned. They don't move very fast, sonny. 
WARNE: I know that! 
MILO: Oh, he's a good lad. He's a bright lad, this boy of yours. Good thinking. Is it all right if I blow my nose, or is that another offence? My old nose. I can't get used to all your fancy air-conditioning. 
HERMACK: That's a pity, Clancey, but I'm afraid you'll have to put up with it a bit longer. Now, how long have you been in the area of beacon Alpha Four? 
MILO: Beacon Alpha Four? 
HERMACK: Yes. 
MILO: Oh. Have you a chart, General? 
HERMACK: Here. 
MILO: Oh, that's where we are. Well, well, well. You see, my charts don't pick up these new fanged beacons. I don't trust them. 
WARNE: Just an astral pointer and a piece of string, huh? 
MILO: That is right, sonny. Hey listen, I can't see beacon Alpha Four here either. That's what I'm telling you. They're unreliable. They're a waste of public money. 
HERMACK: Beacon Alpha Four is not registering because it's not there any more. 
WARNE: The argonite pirates blew it up three hours ago. 
MILO: Oh, did they so. That'd be for salvage I guess. Yeah, that would be it. 
HERMACK: You don't seem very surprised, Clancey. 
MILO: No, no, I'm not, General. This is clearing up a whole heap of things in my head. I can lose every floater I've got and your fancy Space Corps won't do a thing about it. But the government loses one government beacon and that's a different matter. Then you come running. That's what you're here now for 
HERMACK: Well, if there is any truth in your story, Clancey, and we do catch up with the pirates, you'll be entitled to put in a claim for compensation. 
MILO: If I waited for you to catch these critters, I'd catch my death of cold waiting forever. I should think this old crate of yours has about half the speed of a Beta Dart, right? 
WARNE: Our speed is classified information. 
MILO: Oh, that may be, sonny, but this marauding band of sharks, you know they're using Beta Darts, one of the latest. You're in the wrong league, boys. Why don't you just go home where you came from. 
WARNE: How do you know what ship they have? 
MILO: Because I crossed their thieving flight path a couple of times. And if my old Liz had any speed about her, I'd have rammed them.

[Beacon Alpha Four compartment]

(The Doctor is standing on a box and looking through a porthole in the ceiling.) 
ZOE: Can you see anything, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I'm coming down. Look out. 
JAMIE: Well, what's on the other side? Could you see? 
DOCTOR: Jamie, I'm afraid that there's nothing on the other side. Just space. It appears that this machine we're on has been blown into about eight separate pieces. 
ZOE: Are you sure? 
DOCTOR: Well, of course I'm sure. Get up and look for yourself if you don't believe me. 
ZOE: Then that must have been the explosion. 
JAMIE: Doctor, does that mean the Tardis is gone? 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. 
JAMIE: That means we'll never get it back. 
ZOE: I don't understand. Why would anybody want to blow up a space machine? 
DOCTOR: Sabotage perhaps. 
ZOE: But what about those men that tried to killed us? 
DOCTOR: I think they were here to defend the machine. That would explain why they were so unfriendly towards us. 
JAMIE: Well, what you're saying is that we've landed ourselves in the middle of some sort of war in space. 
ZOE: Now we're just floating aimlessly on a bit of debris. 
DOCTOR: No, Zoe, not aimlessly. There appear to be rockets attached to each part of the machine. And they're all moving along together. 
JAMIE: Hey? 
DOCTOR: Well, as you know, Jamie, when something explodes in space, all the pieces separate and go on separating indefinitely, but this machine has separated just so far, perhaps a mile, and now, as I say, they're all moving together at the same speed. 
ZOE: Because of the rockets. Oh, I see. So whoever broke up the machine is sending all the pieces to the same place? 
DOCTOR: It looks like it, Zoe. 
JAMIE: Oh, so we can get back to the Tardis then? If it's only a mile away. 
DOCTOR: A mile in space, Jamie, with no oxygen or means of propulsion. 
ZOE: It might just as well be a thousand miles. 
JAMIE: Oh, that's just fine then. 
ZOE: Have you got an idea, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Shush, shush. Just a minute. 
(There is a buzzing sound.) 
DOCTOR: Now what on earth is that?

[V- Ship flight deck]

MILO: Oh lookie here, General. If you've finished with all your fool questions, I've got work to do. I want to get back to my ship. 
HERMACK: All right, Clancey, I'm sorry to have detained you. 
WARNE: Sir? 
MILO: What? What, you mean I can go? 
HERMACK: Of course. 
MILO: That's great. That's very kind of you. I'll just say goodbye then, General. Goodbye. 
(Milo leaves with an escort.) 
WARNE: The navigators are standing by for orders, sir. 
HERMACK: Obviously you think I've done the wrong thing. 
WARNE: It's not for me to say, General. 
HERMACK: You think I let Clancey go too easily. 
WARNE: I would have put him through the mind probe, sir. 
HERMACK: That did occur to me. He does seem to be mixed up with these argonite pirates. 
WARNE: Too much. 
HERMACK: You think he's in league with them? 
WARNE: It's possible, sir. You said he's no respecter of the law. That story about floaters and pirates could have just been a cover story. 
HERMACK: I quite agree. 
WARNE: You agree, sir? 
HERMACK: Oh yes, Ian. Not only do I think that Milo Clancey is in league with the argonite pirates, I think he is the mastermind behind the whole organisation, which is precisely why I let him go

[Beacon Alpha Four compartment]

(The Doctor prises open an equipment cover and frowns.) 
JAMIE: Oh, what's he doing now? 
ZOE: I've no idea. Ask him. 
JAMIE: Oh, what's the use? He's got his mysterious face on. 
ZOE: Well, I think he's just trying to keep our hopes up. 
JAMIE: Hopes? 
ZOE: By looking busy. There's nothing anyone can do now. I'd say we've got a few hours at the outside. 
JAMIE: What do you mean by a few hours? 
ZOE: Well, haven't you noticed, Jamie? Haven't you noticed how difficult it is to breathe properly now?

[V- Ship flight deck]

WARNE: Bridge to armoury, this is Major Warne. I want a Minnow readied for immediate launching. Fit contact warheads to the Martian missiles. 
(A hatch opens in the 41 painted on the starboard wing, and a little ship that looks more like a mosquito than a minnow comes out. M5-V2 launches.) 
HERMACK: Navigator Penn. 
PENN: Sir? 
HERMACK: Keep contact with Major Warne in the Minnow until he reports he's within visual range of LIZ seventy nine. 
PENN: Very good, sir. 
HERMACK: V-Master to X X one. Come in, Ian.

[Minnow]

WARNE: Okay, General. I'm following Clancey without his knowing.

[V- Ship flight deck]

HERMACK: Yes, but remember he's no fool. If he suspects he's being followed, you'll be in trouble. Meanwhile I'm going in to land on Ta. Relay reports to the nearest beacon.

[Beacon Alpha Four compartment]

ZOE: Oh Doctor, can we have some more oxygen? 
DOCTOR: I'm afraid not, Zoe. We've got to conserve it. 
JAMIE: Oh, what's the use. We'll never get out of this. 
DOCTOR: Come here, both of you. Look. Look at these. 
JAMIE: What are they? 
DOCTOR: They're solar powered magnets. It's a force field. 
JAMIE: Hey? 
DOCTOR: Well, don't you see. The explosive charges that blew this machine apart didn't damage its structure. They simply divided it along the lines of its electromagnetic fields. 
ZOE: How do you know? 
DOCTOR: Because there was no damage to the structure. 
ZOE: You mean the machine was built in separate sections and assembled in space by magnetism. 
DOCTOR: Yes, you see, Jamie, opposite poles attract and the same poles repel. 
(The Doctor demonstrates with a pair of magnets on strings from his pocket.) 
DOCTOR: You see? Try it. There. 
ZOE: Oh, so the explosion was just strong enough to break the magnetic attraction between each section? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
JAMIE: But that doesn't do us any good, does it? 
DOCTOR: But it just might, Jamie. Supposing I could step up the electromagnetic power enough to bridge the space between this section and the next. 
ZOE: You mean draw it towards us. 
DOCTOR: Yes, and then repeat the process with each section and so on until we reach the Tardis! 
JAMIE: Hey, well, do you think you could do it? 
DOCTOR: Well, I've got a screwdriver. 
JAMIE: Oh. 
DOCTOR: And I've got a slight knowledge of electromagnetism. 
ZOE: Yes, there's just one thing, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie, would you move this cylinder out of the way? 
ZOE: How do you know the next section to this one is an opposite pole? 
DOCTOR: Well I don't, Zoe. 
ZOE: Well, if it's similar, your idea won't work, will it? We'll just shoot off in the opposite direction. 
DOCTOR: Zoe, don't be such a pessimist. 
(Meanwhile, the V ship heads towards a planet.)

[Issigri Mining office]

WARNE [on monitor]: Thirteen hundred. X X 1 to V Master. I have made visual contact with LIZ seven nine. We're still orbiting in the same dimensional plane. Nothing further to report. 
(Transmission ends.) 
MADELEINE: It must be very uncomfortable after a few hours in one of those Minnows, General. 
(She tops up his glass.) 
HERMACK: It is. Thank you. But then after a week you get quite used to it. 
MADELEINE: I thought so. LIZ seventy nine is Milo Clancey's ship. 
HERMACK: Your records are very comprehensive. 
MADELEINE: Why is he being followed? 
HERMACK: Well, I explained to you the purpose of this mission. I believe that Clancey has connection with the argonite pirates. 
MADELEINE: That seems unlikely. 
HERMACK: Oh, why? 
MADELEINE: He has argonite mines on the planet Lobos. 
HERMACK: Which I hear are pretty well worked out. 
MADELEINE: They used to say this planet was worked out, but I brought in new machinery and today it's the most productive in the galaxy. 
HERMACK: I must say, I'm surprised to find you of all people defending Clancey. 
MADELEINE: Why? 
HERMACK: Well, because of the rumours connecting him with the death of your father, Dom Issigri. 
MADELEINE: Well, I tried to prove that at the time but nobody knows what happened between them, so now I prefer to forget it. 
HERMACK: But you took over the argonite holdings from your father and split away from Clancey. 
MADELEINE: Yes. 
HERMACK: And now you run the most successful argonite mining business in the galaxy, while Clancey, because of your competition must be pretty nearly bankrupt. 
MADELEINE: Is that why you think he's taken up with piracy? 
HERMACK: Well, jealousy of your great success would be a pretty strong motive. Unless of course, you disagree. 
MADELEINE: Oh, you may be right. But I haven't seen him since the day the partnership was dissolved, so well, I don't know what he feels. 
HERMACK: Well, I can understand it. For a man like Clancey to be defeated by an attractive woman like you at his own game, he'd take any risk to get his revenge. 
MADELEINE: Well, I wouldn't like to think that that was true. 
HERMACK: Your concern does you credit, but I'm convinced I shall have the proof I need within a few hours. 
MADELEINE: Really? How? 
HERMACK: Warne has reported that Clancey is still on the same dimensional orbit as he was when we left him. Obviously he's expecting a rendezvous. 
MADELEINE: With a pirate ship? 
HERMACK: I think so.

[Beacon Alpha Four compartment]

(The Doctor lets some gas out of a cylinder.) 
DOCTOR: I think that's all we can spare. 
JAMIE: How much longer? 
DOCTOR: I've nearly done it, Jamie. I've just got one more connection to make. 
JAMIE: I hope it works. 
DOCTOR: Of course it will work. The theory is perfectly sound. 
JAMIE: Aye, maybe. That wiring looks like a cat's cradle to me. 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, it's a little bit of a mess, Jamie, but I can assure you it's thoroughly functional. Thoroughly functional. Here we are. Now you two had better hold on. Are you ready? 
ZOE: Yes, ready, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Hold tight. Here we go. 
(The Doctor pulls a lever and they are all pushed back.) 
JAMIE: What's happened? 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, you've got it wrong! We're gathering speed! 
DOCTOR: I know! I know! I can't turn it off! 
ZOE: What? 
DOCTOR: Ah! No! I'm stuck. The power's too great. 
JAMIE: Well, isn't it working? 
ZOE: Oh yes, it's working all right, but the wrong way! We're being sucked further into space! 
(And to prove it we see one segment go hurtling away from the other seven.) 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, for goodness sake do something! 
DOCTOR: I'm trying to, Zoe. I'm trying to. 
(The Doctor manages to push the lever back up again. They all fall to the floor, exhausted.) 
ZOE: Oh thank goodness. 
JAMIE: Are we all right now? 
ZOE: Doctor? 
DOCTOR: No, Zoe, I'm afraid we're not. Even if I could reverse the magnetic field, I'm afraid we're too far away from the next section. 
ZOE: Then we're worse off now. Just floating hopelessly in space. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Oh, dear. What a silly idiot I am.

[Issigri Mining office]

MADELEINE: Well naturally, General, I'm prepared to give all the help I can. 
WARNE [on monitor]: Thirteen ten. X X One to V-Master. 
HERMACK: Something must be happening. He's not due to report. 
WARNE [on monitor]: LIZ seven nine is now on retro-drive. She's linking with a section of Alpha Four. Standing by for orders. 
HERMACK: You see? Clancey's in the collection area. He's awaiting the beacon sections. 
MADELEINE: It could be coincidence. He's seen the drifting wreckage and he's curious. 
HERMACK: Madam, you'd need a ITM computer to work that out. No, this is the proof I need. 
MADELEINE: What are you going to do? Arrest him? 
HERMACK: Could I use your audio board? 
MADELEINE: Of course. 
HERMACK: V-Master to X X One. Can you hear me, Ian?

[Minnow]

WARNE: Yes, sir. LIZ seven nine is now completing the link-up. I'm standing by for orders.

[Issigri Mining office]

HERMACK: Good. That means he can't make a sudden move. I want you to go in and arrest him. 
MADELEINE: Tell your man to be careful, General. Clancey has a terrible temper. He's likely to explode like glycerol trinitrate. 
HERMACK: Ian, if he shows any sign of resistance, use your missiles. Otherwise, escort him back here. 
WARNE [on monitor]: I understand, sir. 
HERMACK: Report back when the arrest is made. 
(Behind Hermack's back, Madeleine looks pleased.)

[Beacon Alpha Four compartment]

(Everyone is lying down. The Doctor opens the cylinder valve.) 
DOCTOR: Here you are. 
JAMIE: Empty. 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, what about you? 
DOCTOR: I don't need so much as you. 
(There's a noise outside.) 
JAMIE: What's that? 
DOCTOR: Just a minute, Jamie. Listen. 
(Sparks fall from points in the wall.) 
ZOE: They're cutting through the bolts in the hull. 
JAMIE: We've been discovered. 
DOCTOR: Wait a minute, Jamie. 
(A section of wall is pushed in and Milo enters holding his cutter like a gun.) 
JAMIE: Oh no, you don't. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, no! 
(Milo shoots Jamie.) 
ZOE: You murderer! 
(The blaster rifle swings round to cover her)

Episode Three

[Beacon Alpha Four compartment]

MILO: Stay still, the pair of you, unless you want to follow him.

[Issigri Mining office]

HERMACK: Ah, Penn. 
PENN: Sir? 
HERMACK: Major Warne needs some assistance. I want you to take the ship out and stand off at twenty miles, just in case Clancey tries any tricks during the landing. 
PENN: Very good, sir. 
MADELEINE: Aren't you going with your ship, General? 
HERMACK: No, I shall be in charge of ground reception. Leave a section of guards, Penn, with short-ranged missiles. 
PENN: Right, sir. How long shall I keep the ship in stand-off orbit, sir? 
HERMACK: You can come in just as soon as Clancey hits the landing pad. 
PENN: Sir. 
(Penn leaves.) 
MADELEINE: All this for one old man. You aren't taking any chances, are you. 
HERMACK: That is why I'm a general, madam. 
MADELEINE: Well, what will happen to him? 
HERMACK: Well, he'll be taken back to home planet and tried. 
MADELEINE: And end in a Nervan prison chamber. 
HERMACK: Well, when Clancey turned pirate, he knew the penalties if he was caught. 
MADELEINE: Oh yes, I know, but I mean, I can't help feeling sorry for him. I offered to buy him out two years ago. 
HERMACK: And he refused. 
MADELEINE: I offered much more than his worked-out concessions are worth. He could have ended his days in luxury. 
HERMACK: Why didn't he accept your offer, madam? 
MADELEINE: Who knows? He's a foolish old man. 
WARNE [on monitor]: Thirteen thirty. X X One to V-Master. I'm receiving no audio response from LIZ seven nine. 
HERMACK: Is LIZ seventy nine on thrust or stationary? 
WARNE: Stationary, sir. She's berthed against a section of the beacon. 
HERMACK: Right. Now listen, Ian. If you get no reply within two minutes, you are to fire your warning rockets. And then, if necessary, stand off and use the Martian missiles.

[LIZ 79]

WARNE [OC]: This is Minnow fighter X X One to LIZ seven nine. You have one minute to surrender. I repeat, you have one minute to surrender, Clancey. Are you hearing me?

[Beacon Alpha Four compartment]

MILO: Now come on, now. If you don't answer my questions, I'm going to have to start getting tough with you! 
DOCTOR: Look, I think he's just stunned, Zoe. Now, look here, my man, I will not be threatened in this bullying manner! Do you understand? 
MILO: Oh, no. A boy, a girl and a nut case. You can't be the pirates. 
DOCTOR: Pirates? Pirates! Oh, I see! 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, he's coming round. 
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie. 
MILO: Yes, I think he is coming round, girl. I only give him a quarter blast. Hey, listen, you there. Listen, she calls you Doctor. Doctor she called you. Now why did she say that? 
DOCTOR: Sheer politeness. 
ZOE: Are you all right, Jamie? 
DOCTOR: Come on. 
MILO: Now look, I'm not going to stand any more of this nonsense. Now, I want to know who you are and where you come from? Now, come on! 
ZOE: It's very rude to point, you know. Especially with a gun. 
DOCTOR: I told you she was polite. 
MILO: How did you get here? 
DOCTOR: Oh, we just arrived. 
MILO: Oh you mean you got some sort of ship you docked on the beacon? 
DOCTOR: Not so much on it as 
ZOE: In it. 
MILO: What, inside? Now how could you be doing that? Look, that is not possible. 
JAMIE: Anything's possible in the Tardis, especially when he's at the controls. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, you're better. 
MILO: You really expect me to swallow a story like that? Now look, if I don't get the truth out of you three comics in about ten seconds. 
ZOE: But it is the truth! 
MILO: One 
ZOE: Everything we've told you is true. 
MILO: Two. Three (Warne launches two rockets.) 
MILO: Nine Ten! Now, come on, the truth. I want the whole truth. 
(Boom.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, what on Earth's that? 
MILO: Someone's firing at us. Come on, let's get out of here! 
DOCTOR: Hey, wait for me!

[LIZ 79]

(Milo undocks from the compartment.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, there you are. Who's firing at us? Is it those pirates? 
MILO: No, no! Now quiet, I want to hear this! Listen! 
WARNE [OC]: That was a warning shot, Clancey. You've no hope of getting away. Surrender or I'll put the next missile through your hull. 
MILO: My, my, my! It's that soft-faced puppy from the Space Corps. Hang on to something, everyone, while I got to try a little trick or two on that boy. 
(Milo does some sharp manoeuvres, throwing everyone to the floor. A china teapot falls out of a cupboard and breaks.) 
WARNE [OC]: I can see you moving, Clancey. I'll give you ten seconds to turn about. Ten seconds then I'm sending a missile in. 
MILO: Ten seconds! The nerve of that green-horn, saying things like that to me. 
WARNE [OC]: One, two, three 
DOCTOR: Don't you think it would be wiser to parley with him? 
MILO: Hold your hiccups, Doctor. Milo Clancey don't take ultimatums from nobody. 
WARNE [OC]: Five. 
JAMIE: Well, you can at least see what he wants. 
ZOE: He's going to fire a missile onto us! 
MILO: I got a trick here worth ten missiles. 
WARNE [OC]: Nine. Ten. All right, Clancey, you had your chance. 
(Milo grabs a large lever and pulls, releasing a cloud of particles from Liz's stern.) 
MILO: That's for that young green-horn and his new-fangled toy. Get yourself out of that one, boy. 
ZOE: What happened? What did you do, Mister Clancey? 
MILO: My own invention, my little chickabiddy. Two tons of copper needles I just lay out beside me when one of those new-fangled spaceships gets too close for comfort. 
ZOE: But how do copper needles stop a spaceship? 
JAMIE: Aye, and a missile? 
MILO: Well, you see, they've all got those new-fangled computer guidance systems, you see? The argonite in the spaceship, that attracts all the copper, then all those thousand little needles, they all jigger up all their computer scanners. 
ZOE: What's argonite? 
MILO: What is argonite?! Don't they learn you nothing at school, girl? 
ZOE: They didn't teach me anything about argonite. 
MILO: Oh! 
ZOE: Have you ever heard of argonite, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well, from what Mister Clancey was saying, I imagine it's a metal that's used in the construction of spacecraft. Am I right? MILO: Argonite is used for, well, it's used for practically everything. It's ductile, it's tensile, it's heat-proof, it's practically indestructible. 
DOCTOR: Magnetically polarised for copper. 
MILO: Ah. You mean to say that you have honestly never heard of argonite? It's the most expensive mineral in the galaxy. 
DOCTOR: I told you already. We don't come from this civilisation. We are visitors. 
JAMIE: Aye, and I hope we're not stopping long. 
MILO: Well, if that doesn't beat jumping grasshoppers. You mean to say you travel around in time as well as space? 
DOCTOR: Well, yes, yes. You've grasped the principle very well. 
MILO: Hey, hey! That must be a mighty interesting thing to do. 
JAMIE: Aye, it would be, if we knew where we were going to land up every time. 
DOCTOR: It's just a minor fault in the system. I shall 
DOCTOR + JAMIE: Put it right in time. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
ZOE: If we ever see the Tardis again. 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. By the way, Mister Clancey, would it be going out of your way to drop us off at the space station, please? 
MILO: I can't do that. It's all in bits, isn't it. 
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. Oh, my word. Do you know where they are? 
MILO: No, no, no. Only the argonite pirates know that. They're toting them off for salvage. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear, well, that will be difficult, won't it. 
MILO: Hey, we shouldn't be sitting around here. We should be get getting the heck out of here before that General Hermack starts to send some more Minnows out, and I've used up all my copper needles. 
JAMIE: Well, who's General Hermack? 
MILO: General Herm? He's the Space Corps. He's trailing those pirates. He thinks I'm one of them. That's why I say he's bone-headed. Now look, let's move out of here. Excuse me. Watch out. That's it, get over there. That's it, over there. Come on, boy. 
ZOE: Mister Clancey. 
MILO: Look, you're a good girl and you promise not to cause me trouble, you can call me Milo. 
ZOE: Oh, well Milo. There's one thing I don't understand. 
MILO: Well you're very lucky, girl. There's about a hundred thousand things I don't understand, but I don't stand around asking fool questions about them, I do something useful. Why don't you do something useful. Why don't you make us all a pot of tea or something? 
JAMIE: The pot was broken. 
DOCTOR: That would be lovely. 
MILO: Well, there's a metal pot in that cupboard there, made of tillium. 
DOCTOR: Tillium? 
MILO: Yah, that's what this whole spaceship's made of, tillium. Lasted me a lifetime round the galaxy. Makes a lousy cup of tea. 
ZOE: Oh, that's what I couldn't understand. Why your space ship wasn't affected by the copper needles. 
JAMIE: What'll happen to us if one of those wee minnow things catches up with us? 
MILO: Ah, don't worry lad, they won't. I'm going to go to the one place that General will never think of looking.

[Issigri Mining office]

(The cloud of copper needles is creating interference with the communications.) 
WARNE [on monitor]: He used some kind of anti-missile device, sir. Jammed all my controls. 
HERMACK: Major Warne, can you hear me? I repeat, can you hear me? 
WARNE [on monitor]: Just about, sir. 
HERMACK: You let Clancey make a complete fool of you! Are you still tracking his ship? 
WARNE [on monitor]: No, sir. My radar and sonar screens are out of action. 
HERMACK: What? 
WARNE [on monitor]: Well, I can't sit here with just (static) I request assistance immediately, sir. 
HERMACK: Your request is noted. 
(Transmission ends. Madeleine enters with a secretary.) 
MADELEINE: These are the shipping times. Send them out on transprinter to all branch stations. These are production figures and loading dates. Code them and send them to head office right away. Priority clear. Anything wrong, General? 
HERMACK: Yes. Clancey has escaped. 
MADELEINE: How did that happen? 
HERMACK: I don't know yet but I mean to find out. May I monopolise your video channel a while longer? 
MADELEINE: Well, of course. 
HERMACK: Thank you. General Hermack to V forty one. 
PENN [on monitor]: Yes, General. 
HERMACK: Ah, Penn. Did you pick up Major Warne's last report on your monitor? 
PENN [on monitor]: Some of it, sir. There was a lot of interference. 
HERMACK: Right. Now I want the rest of the minnow fleet launched and I want LIZ seventy nine found and destroyed. Is that understood? 
PENN on monitor]: Yes, sir. 
HERMACK: Report back as soon as the Minnow fleet is clear. I am not giving Milo Clancey any more chances. 
(The Minnow fighters are launched.)

[LIZ 79]

JAMIE: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie? 
JAMIE: I think I'm going to be sick. 
DOCTOR: Now, now, now, Jamie. Will power, will power. 
ZOE: Any more tea anyone? 
MILO: I'll have another cup if there's some there, Zoe. There you are, that's as good as new. 
(Milo has been making adjustments with a spanner.) 
DOCTOR: Milo? 
MILO: Hello. 
DOCTOR: I've been watching this pressure gauge. It is just a little bit high, isn't it? 
MILO: Yeah, it is a bittie. That's your thermonuclear power, you see. Yeah, it's wearing out a bit. Nothing you can do about that. 
DOCTOR: Well, except slow down. I mean, there could be a nasty explosion, couldn't there? 
MILO: Ah, don't you worry, Doctor. It's a mighty strong little ship, this. They don't make ships like this these days, you know. 
JAMIE: You can say that again. 
MILO: Ah, don't you worry, lad. We haven't got far to go. 
ZOE: Where are we going? You haven't said. 
MILO: Well, ma'am, I'll tell ya. We're going to the one place where they'll never think of looking for us. 
(Milo turns on a scanner.) 
MILO: That's the planet called Ta. 
DOCTOR: Oh? Oh yes. Is it inhabited? 
MILO: Yeah, it is these days. It's the headquarters of the Issigri Mining Corporation. 
JAMIE: Why do you say they won't bother to look for us. 
MILO: Well, you see, Madeleine Issigri, who runs that show now, she's a sworn enemy of mine. Well, so I've been told. Anyway, General Hermack will think I'll go anywhere else rather than go there. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but if she's a sworn enemy, won't she give you away? 
MILO: We won't be announcing our arrival, Doctor. We'll just lie low there until that old Space Corps gets tired of looking for us. 
ZOE: It doesn't look as though there's anything there. This side is just desert. 
MILO: No, no, there's no surface life on Ta, girl. There's too much ultra-violet radiation. Don't you worry, don't you worry. We'll be all right. We'll be a mile underground as long as I can fall into my old landing pad. 
DOCTOR: Oh, you've been there before, have you? 
MILO: Certainly have, certainly have. Me and my old partner, Dom Issigri, god rest his poor tired old soul, we turned that whole planet into a piece of Gruyere cheese between us. 
JAMIE: Gruyere cheese. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, here. Mining! I see. For argonite, presumably. 
MILO: Yeah, that's right, argonite. One of the richest strikes we ever found. Took us about ten years to drill that clean. Well, I'd better try to find this old entry shaft then. Now, you'd better brace yourselves. Hang onto something. My landing pad's ain't as good as they used to be. 
JAMIE: Who cares as long as it's quick.

[Issigri Mining office]

HERMACK: Bring the ship in on pad three. I'll join you there, Penn. 
PENN [on monitor]: Yes, sir. 
MADELEINE: I'm sorry your stay was so short, General. 
HERMACK: Well, I hope on my next visit, my duties will be less pressing. 
MADELEINE: So do I. Where do you go from now? 
HERMACK: Well, first of all I must get young Warne out of that fix he's got himself into. Then I must collect my pickets from the beacons. And after that, Lobos. MADELEINE: Lobos! 
HERMACK: Hmm mmm. 
MADELEINE: Milo Clancey's base? 
HERMACK: The pirate's base. Those beacons they've been breaking up will be heading there. With a little bit of luck, we shall be able to wipe out the whole nest in one operation. 
MADELEINE: Well, I hope you do. Some of my crews are demanding arms in case they're attacked. 
(On his way to the door, Hermack notices a model of a sleek black spaceship.) 
HERMACK: Is that a, is that a Beta Dart? 
MADELEINE: Yes. Yes, our company's just bought two. They're our fastest freighters. 
HERMACK: Ah. I must bear that in mind. The pirates have a Beta Dart. I should hate to knock out one of your ships by mistake. 
MADELEINE: Well I don't think that's likely. All our freighters show the Issigri nose-cone when they're in commission. 
(She slides a pattern nose cone onto the model.) 
MADELEINE: I designed it myself. 
HERMACK: Ah, very distinctive. How much does it cost? 
MADELEINE: Oh, a hundred million credits upwards. Depends on the fittings. Why do you ask? 
HERMACK: I was just wondering where Milo Clancey got a hundred million credits. 
MADELEINE: I see. You think he got it by selling the stolen argonite. 
HERMACK: Why not? It's logical. There's an illicit market for them on Rita Magnum, I hear. 
MADELEINE: Yes, but I'm sure you're wrong about Milo Clancey. 
HERMACK: Are you? I'm not. He's selling the stuff and professing poverty as a cover. If I find those beacons sections on line for Lobos, he'll not live to enjoy his money. 
MADELEINE: Goodbye, General. 
HERMACK: Goodbye, Miss Issigri. Thank you for your hospitality.

[LIZ 79]

(The Liz lands with a big bump, throwing everyone around again.) 
MILO: Nice smooth landing, after all. 
JAMIE: Smooth? What do you call a rough landing? 
MILO: What's the matter with you, sonny? Are you getting soft or something? 
JAMIE: Just let me get my feet back on the ground, that's all. 
MILO: You stay right here where you're safe, boy. 
JAMIE: Safe? Is that what you call this? 
DOCTOR: You want us to stay here? 
MILO: Yeah. I'm thinking of your own safety. 
JAMIE: Why? 
MILO: Well, we're a mile underground here. This is the old freighter dock. And there's nothing to see, there's nowhere to go, it's just a whole maze of argonite tunnels, and if you go in there, well, even I mayn't be able to find you again. You stay right here in this ship. 
DOCTOR: Just a minute, where are you going? 
MILO: I've got to go to the generator room. I think one of their rockets must have gone through my transmitter unit. That radio there's whistling like some sort of hysterical canary. 
(Milo leaves with his tool bag.) 
JAMIE: Doctor, do you believe him? 
DOCTOR: I don't know, Jamie. What do you think? 
JAMIE: Well, he never did explain how he turned up the way he did, did he? And that Space Corp ship was chasing him. 
DOCTOR: True. But I think we've got to trust him, Jamie. If we leave this ship, we'll never ever have a chance of finding the Tardis again. 
JAMIE: Well I don't see we've got much of a chance anyway. Look, it's up there in space somewhere on a bit of that beacon heading for I don't know where. 
DOCTOR: A blast furnace, I imagine. I think I think the pirates are probably going to take the pieces and melt them down for the for the argonite. The trouble is, we can't guess where their headquarters is. 
ZOE: There's no need to guess, Doctor. It's easy enough to work out. 
DOCTOR: What? 
ZOE: Applied mathematics. 
DOCTOR: Applied? Oh, I see. You've been messing about again, have you? 
ZOE: Oh well, if you don't want to know what I've discovered. 
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. Come along, surprise us. 
ZOE: This was the position of our bit of beacon when Milo first saw us. I got the figures from the computer. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes. 
ZOE: And this was our position eight minutes later when he docked along side. 
DOCTOR: Yes, circle fourteen. Yes, go on. 
ZOE: Well, from this data it was simple enough to work out our original position and course. Do you see? 
DOCTOR: Yes, except that after my little experiment, we veered rather violently off that course. 
JAMIE: Ah yes 
ZOE: Yes, but I allowed for that. Look! 
DOCTOR: Oh. 
JAMIE: Oh. 
ZOE: Electromagnetic waves are always at right-angles to the direction of propagation, and, as you know, travel at one hundred and eighty six thousand, two hundred and eighty two miles per second. 
DOCTOR: Do they really? How interesting. Well, what's the answer? 
ZOE: Here! 
DOCTOR: What? 
ZOE: If we'd stayed on our original course, the Tardis would have landed within ten miles of where we are now. Except, of course, it would still be up there because we weren't travelling quite so fast. 
DOCTOR: Oh, bless my soul! Yes, of course. Yes, as you say, a simple calculation. I should have thought of that myself. 
ZOE: Yes, I wonder why you didn't? 
JAMIE: Did all that talk mean that the Tardis is going to land somewhere around here? 
DOCTOR: Jamie, it's all here, written down. It's as plain as a pike-staff. 
JAMIE: Aye, well, in that case, the pirates are going to be round here too! 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, you're right. 
ZOE: Do you think Milo's one of them and that's why he landed here? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think it's possible. 
JAMIE: Aye, he seemed to know all about them, didn't he? Look, I think we ought to get out of here before he comes back. 
ZOE: Yes, so do I. We don't even know if he has gone to the generator room. He might just have gone to get his gang. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
(The Doctor checks outside the cabin.) 
DOCTOR: All right. All right, but if the Tardis has landed here we'll have to find it anyway. Come on, you two, but for heaven's sake don't make a noise on the ladder. 
(Jamie falls over something.) 
ZOE: Jamie! 
JAMIE: We're not on the ladder yet, are we.

[Mine shaft HQ]

(In a nearby tunnel, Dervish approaches a door with two other pirates.) 
CAVEN: Wait here! 
(He enters the cavern HQ where Caven is at a communications desk.) 
DERVISH: What's the panic, Caven? 
CAVEN: No panic. 
DERVISH: Well, you know what I mean. I got a Red emergency flash. 
CAVEN: I wanted to talk to you, Dervish. 
DERVISH: Well? 
CAVEN: What's the position at the plant? 
DERVISH: We've just started on the last section of Alpha Two. 
CAVEN: Leave it. 
DERVISH: Leave it? 
CAVEN: Suledin's capable of taking change down there, isn't he? 
DERVISH: Well yes, but 
CAVEN: Right, when you've finished your flight service, I want you to take the ship out. 
DERVISH: Me? Where? 
CAVEN: The Alpha Four sections are being re-routed. 
DERVISH: Re-route? 
CAVEN: To Lobos. 
DERVISH: Lobos? But that's impossible! 
CAVEN: When I give an order, nobody says it's impossible, Dervish. 
DERVISH: Well, do you know how far Lobos is? I mean, the beacon rockets will have to be re-fuelled. 
CAVEN: That's right. That's exactly what I want you to do. 
DERVISH: Yeah, but the Space Corps have got a V-ship and a flight of Minnows up there. It's too dangerous! 
CAVEN: It has to be done. They've got to be drawn off. 
DERVISH: Well, why can't you do it, then? You're the master pilot. I'm only supposed to be the engineer. 
CAVEN: I've got to do things down here. 
DERVISH: Yes, so I've got to go and risk my life while 
(Caven draws a gun.) 
CAVEN: You keep arguing, Dervish, and Suledin will be having your job permanently. Now are you going to take that ship out or aren't you? 
DERVISH: Yes, of course, Caven. I was only just trying to point out the dangers, that's all. 
CAVEN: Well, now you're in more danger here than you ever will be in space. 
(An alarm sounds.) 
DERVISH: It's the perimeter alarm. 
MAN [OC]: Intruders in perimeter tunnel nine. Perimeter tunnel nine. 
CAVEN: Alert the guards. I'm coming down. 
DERVISH: Is it the Space Corps? 
CAVEN: I don't know, but whoever it is, we can deal with them in the tunnel complex. Now get moving! 
DERVISH: Right

[Mine shaft]

(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe have arrived in the dark, dank, fissure-strewn lower tunnels.) 
ZOE: I'm sure we should have turned right back there. 
JAMIE: We did turn right. 
ZOE: I mean earlier. We seem to be getting deeper. 
JAMIE: What do you think, Doctor? Should we go on or turn back? 
DOCTOR: I think we should have done as Milo told us. He said we'd get lost. 
ZOE: The tunnels probably run for hundreds of miles. 
JAMIE: Well, if they do, we'll never get ourselves out. 
DOCTOR: Shush. Just a minute, Jamie. 
ZOE: What? 
DOCTOR: I can hear something. 
JAMIE: There it is. A buzzing noise. 
ZOE: Where's it coming from? 
DOCTOR: Seems to be up ahead there.

[LIZ 79]

MILO: Well, that's all right again, right as rain. Hey, where are you? Zoe? Doctor? They ain't here. Oh, why can't some people do what they're told. I guess I'd better go out and try and find them. 
(Strapping on his gun and taking a haversack from a cupboard, Milo leaves.)

[Mine shaft]

JAMIE: Hey, Doctor. There's a wee light there, look. 
DOCTOR: Where? 
JAMIE: Just shining through a crack in the wall. 
ZOE: You're right, it is a light. 
DOCTOR: Yes, it's reflected through from the other side. I wonder if we can 
JAMIE: Too high to see anything. 
ZOE: I'm the lightest. If you can lift me up perhaps I could see through. 
DOCTOR: All right. You jump onto Jamie's back. 
JAMIE: What? Oh. 
DOCTOR: There we are. Can you see anything? 
ZOE: A bit higher. 
JAMIE: Hurry up. 
(Peering through to the cavern beyond, Zoe sees three figures in welding suits using thermal lances to cut chunks from a large metal structure.) 
DOCTOR: Well? 
ZOE: There are three men in there and I think they're pirates. 
JAMIE: How do you know? They could be miners. 
ZOE: No, they're cutting up bits of scrap and it looks like part of the beacon. 
DOCTOR: It looks as though we've stumbled on their headquarters. Yes, of course. That noise is an electrical furnace. 
JAMIE: Did you see the Tardis? 
ZOE: No, just the three men. 
JAMIE: Doctor, we've got to try and stop them before they start cutting it up. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Now the first thing we'd better do is 
(A blaze of light hits them and they turn to see a portable floodlight coming their way. The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe retreat, encouraged by gunfire.) 
CAVEN: Keep moving! 
DOCTOR: All right! There's no need for that! 
CAVEN: Back! Back! Back! Back! 
ZOE: Quick! Down this passage! 
DOCTOR: Run! 
(Zoe dives through a crevice. Jamie and the Doctor follow, screaming as they fall.)

Episode Four

  [Mine chamber]

 (Zoe, Jamie and the Doctor have landed in a heap on a hard surface.) 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, are you all right? 
DOCTOR: No. 
JAMIE: What's the matter? 
DOCTOR: Just a minute. 
(The Doctor takes a broken packet from his back trouser pocket.) 
ZOE: What are you carrying drawing pins for? 
DOCTOR: I like drawing pins. Ouch. Normally.

[Mine chamber]

(Caven puts his gun away.) 
CAVEN: Right. They won't give us any more trouble.

[Lower mine shaft]

JAMIE: Oh, my leg! 
ZOE: Are you all right? 
JAMIE: I must have twisted it when I landed. Oh, now where are we? 
ZOE: It looks like some sort of a prison cell. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
(Someone groans in the gloom.) 
JAMIE: What's that? 
ZOE: Oh, Doctor, there's something over there. 
(Up above, Caven and his men leave, and Milo appears to go and look down into the shaft. The Doctor investigates the groaning and finds someone lying against the wall.) 
DOCTOR: Oh dear. 
JAMIE: What is it? 
DOCTOR: Look. 
JAMIE: Hey, it's that chap from the beacon. The one that was shooting at us. 
ZOE: Yes, he's injured. Look. 
DOCTOR: I think it's his shoulder. I think it's only a bruise. It's not broken. Lift him up, very gently. What's this? 
(The Doctor sniffs at an earthenware bowl.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all right. 
(The Doctor wets his handkerchief in the water and puts it to Sorba's forehead.) 
JAMIE: Ah, he's coming around.

[Mine shaft HQ]

(Caven is using his transmitter.) 
CAVEN: Come in, Beta Buccaneer. 
DERVISH [on monitor]: I want permission to return to base. Caven, do you hear me? I'm bringing this ship in. 
CAVEN: Calm down, man. Report your position. 
DERVISH [on monitor]: We're forty three thousand miles out, on course for the beacon sections. 
CAVEN: Well, you should be among them in twenty minutes. What's wrong? Why the panic? 
DERVISH [on monitor]: We're running our heads into a trap, Caven. The Space Corp cruiser is less than three hours away, and on a convergent course. 
CAVEN: Those beacon sections have got to be diverted to Lobos. How long will that take? 
DERVISH [on monitor]: It will take at least two hours. We just can't do it on time. 
CAVEN: You'll have to, Dervish. Just find some way of cutting the time. 
DERVISH [on monitor]: Those Minnow fighters will blast us to bits. I'm bringing the ship in! 
CAVEN: Now wait, don't be so impulsive. 
(Caven holds up a wired cylinder.) 
CAVEN: Surely you recognise this, Dervish? You designed it. 
DERVISH [on monitor: Well, it's a UHF detonator. What are you playing at, Caven? 
CAVEN: I'm not playing at all. It is a detonator, and it is keyed to a charge right under the atomic drives of the Buccaneer. 
DERVISH [on monitor]: I don't believe it. You you're bluffing. 
CAVEN: If you think I'm bluffing, just you try turning back. You see, Dervish, you've got a fair chance of escaping the V-ship and the Minnows, but you've no chance at all of getting away from this. 
DERVISH [on monitor]: All right, Caven. 
CAVEN: I knew you wouldn't let me down. Report as soon as you reach the sections.

[V-Ship flight deck]

PENN: All set. Operational? Right. Thank you. Major Warne's just come aboard, sir. He's coming up to the bridge. 
HERMACK: Good. Bridge to Power Room. We're under way again. Half boost. Set course for Lobos, Penn. 
PENN: Very good, sir. 
(Warne enters.) 
WARNE: Thanks for the rescue, sir. 
HERMACK: Ah. What happened to you, anyway? 
(Warne shows him a piece of metal.) 
HERMACK: Copper needles? 
WARNE: Yes, sir. I warned Clancey I was about to fire one of the Martian missiles. I pressed the button and the next thing I ran slap into a cloud of these. The computer blew and the whole machine just stopped. 
HERMACK: Copper! Of course! Attracted by the argonite hull of the Minnow. 
WARNE: Yes, sir. It won't happen again, sir. 
HERMACK: It had better not. When one old man in a worn out junk-heap like the Liz makes a complete fool of a highly trained fighter pilot in a sophisticated flight ship I 
WARNE: Yes, sir. Well, I'll hit him with a deflection shot next time, sir. I worked out how to do it. You see 
HERMACK: Never mind the theories, Major. With a bit of luck, Clancey will not be able to exploit your limitations again because we shall take him on the ground. 
WARNE: On the ground, sir? 
HERMACK: Yes, we're on course for Lobos, the headquarters of the Clancey Mining Company. 
WARNE: You think that's where he's gone? 
HERMACK: I'm sure of it. Apart from Ta, it's the next nearest planet. Yes, that's where Clancey will be and that's where we shall find our evidence. The sections of Beacon Alpha Four.

[Mine chamber]

ZOE: Are you feeling better? 
SORBA: You were on the beacon. What are you doing here? 
JAMIE: Oh, look, it's all right. We're friends. 
SORBA: Friends? You led my men into a trap. 
JAMIE: We were in the same trap ourselves. The pirates left us for dead. 
SORBA: I thought you were decoys. 
ZOE: Oh look, we wouldn't be here now if we were helping them. 
SORBA: Then how did you get off the beacon? 
DOCTOR: Well, well, it's a long story, but the important thing is to escape from here now. 
SORBA: Do you think I haven't tried? That shaft is the only way in. It's impossible to get out. 
DOCTOR: Oh, no. There's another entrance here somewhere. 
SORBA: I've searched every inch of this cell. Solid rock. 
DOCTOR: There's a hidden door. The problem of course, is going to be finding it. 
SORBA: There's no door, believe me. You're only wasting your time. 
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. There's obviously a less painful way of getting in here so there must be a way of getting out. 
ZOE: What makes you so sure? I mean, it could be a sort of tomb. 
JAMIE: Aye, a burial pit. 
DOCTOR: Look. Water, in a fragile bowl. Well that couldn't have been thrown down that chute, now could it?

[Mine shaft HQ]

DERVISH [on monitor]: Caven, I've got the crews out realigning the auxiliary rockets for Lobos, but one of the beacon sections is missing. 
CAVEN: That's not possible. 
DERVISH [on monitor]: Look, there's only seven sections here. There should be eight. I checked back right along the flight path, but there's not a sign of it. It's completely disappeared. 
CAVEN: Nothing disappears in space. Even if the rocket exploded there'd be debris along the flight path. 
DERVISH [on monitor]: There's no debris, there's nothing. It's completely disappeared. The scanner shows zero find. 
CAVEN: But that's crazy. There must be some explanation. 
DERVISH [on monitor]: Oh yeah, there's an explanation all right, but you're not going to like it. 
CAVEN: Well, come on, come on. 
DERVISH [on monitor]: Somebody must have engineered the section out of its flight path. 
CAVEN: How could anybody manage that? 
DERVISH [on monitor]: Well, I don't know. 
CAVEN: Wait a minute. That space guard. The one we took off the beacon. 
DERVISH [on monitor]: Lieutenant Sorba? 
CAVEN: Yes. He said something about seeing strangers on board. Perhaps he wasn't raving. Perhaps we've got competition, Dervish. Someone trying to cut themselves in, hey? 
DERVISH [OC]: Just a minute. Look, I've got to go. Once of the spider teams wants picking up. 
CAVEN: Right. I'll question Sorba about these strangers he saw. Call in as soon as you get the sections on the new flight path.

[Mine chamber]

(The Doctor and Jamie are carefully checking the walls.) 
SORBA: They're mad. It's solid rock. 
ZOE: When the Doctor gets an idea, nobody can change his mind. 
JAMIE: Oh look Doctor, this is doing no good at all. 
DOCTOR: Patience, Jamie, patience. 
JAMIE: You'll not find anything. We've been over it three times already. 
DOCTOR: It's got to be here. Look. 
JAMIE: Aye, I know. Cracks in the wall. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but see the way they run. 
JAMIE: There are marks like that all over the place. 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we're going to go on trying. 
ZOE: Now what's he doing? 
JAMIE: Oh, search me. 
(The Doctor is listening to the wall through his stethoscope.) 
DOCTOR: There's got to be a control unit here somewhere. Just a question of locating it, that's all. 
ZOE: What sort of control unit? 
DOCTOR: Shush, shush. Just a minute. 
(The Doctor taps one piece of wall.) 
DOCTOR: Ah ha. Yes. Yes, it's under there. 
JAMIE: What's under there? 
DOCTOR: An audio lock. 
ZOE: An audio lock! 
JAMIE: Oh now, wait a minute, what's an audio lock? 
DOCTOR: Well, they were used on safes, Jamie. Combination locks became a little too easy to open when burglars took to taking miniature computers with them on their expeditions. Now I have my tuning forks here somewhere. 
ZOE: What are you going to do with a tuning fork? 
DOCTOR: I usually carry them with. Ah, yes. Here we are, now then, get these sorted out. Right. 
JAMIE: Which end did he land on when you fell down that shaft?

[V-Ship flight deck]

PENN: Contact ahead, sir! 
HERMACK: What contact? 
PENN: It could be the sections of Alpha Four, sir. There are seven objects moving quite slowly. 
WARNE: If it's the beacon, sir, there should be eight sections. 
HERMACK: What's their course, Penn? 
WARNE: Approximately the same as ours, sir. The convergence is less than half a degree. 
HERMACK: Then the flight destination must be Lobos. Clancey's home planet. We've got him, Ian. 
WARNE: We can't be sure it is the beacon, sir. Well, we counted eight sections originally. 
HERMACK: Just a minute. What's that on the edge of the scanner? 
PENN: I'm trying to get a fix on it now, sir. It's just come into frame. 
HERMACK: It must be the missing section. 
PENN: No, sir, it's too big and it's moving too fast. I think it's some kind of ship. 
HERMACK: Out there? No, with any luck it's the pirates. 
WARNE: She seems to be circling. 
HERMACK: Can't you magnify that signal, Penn? 
PENN: No, sir. She's right out on the fringe. 
HERMACK: Ian, get down to the Minnow deck. I want you ready to go as soon as we've got an identification. 
WARNE: Right, sir. 
HERMACK: Power room? I want main boost for as long as we can hold it. Don't worry about those beacon sections, Penn. That ship is our target. 
PENN: Right, sir. Shall I get your (unintelligible) sir? 
HERMACK: Not yet. Go to half speed. General Hermack. I want all crews at emergency stations. I repeat, all crews at emergency stations. 
WARNE [on monitor]: X X 2 ready to go. Any news yet, V-Master? 
HERMACK: The range is down to forty minutes. Penn has just made a positive identification. It is a Beta Dart, so they can still outrun us. 
WARNE [on monitor]: She won't outrun a Minnow, sir. 
PENN: Sir, she's boosting. She must have spotted us. 
HERMACK: Right! V-Master to X X 2. Blast away! 
WARNE [on monitor]: Right, sir. I'll bring back a chunk of her.

[Mine shaft HQ]

CAVEN: There's a Space Corps lieutenant in the punishment cell under tunnel nine. He's injured. I want him brought here for questioning. 
GUARD: Yes, sir. 
CAVEN: Here's the audio-lock tuner key. 
(The guard leaves.) 
DERVISH [on monitor]: This is Beta Buccaneer. Caven! There's a Minnow fighter on our tail. 
CAVEN: Only one? What's his range? 
DERVISH [OC]: Thirty minutes, but closing fast. And we're on maximum boost. 
CAVEN: Can't you hold him off long enough to reach the camouflage cone? 
DERVISH [OC]: That's just what I'm going to try and do.

[V-Ship flight deck]

WARNE [on monitor]: X X 2 to V-Master. I seem to have lost contact. Can you steer me in, please? 
HERMACK: Stand by. Major Warne's lost her. 
PENN: I thought he would, sir. She's doubled round. 
HERMACK: I'll switch it through on audio. You get an RC track for him to track on. 
PENN: Very good, sir. This is Navigator Penn to X X 2. Are you reading me? 
WARNE [OC]: Yes, I just don't have a nice picture of that Beta Dart any more. 
PENN: Okay, sir. Now, if you steer round seven under TDC. Now thirty seven degrees up. 
(There is a detached rocket nose cone with the livery of the Issigri mining company floating in space. The Beta Dart lines up with it and drifts forward so it locks onto it.) 
PENN: She should be in range now, sir. 
WARNE [OC]: Right. I can see her on the visual scanners. 
HERMACK: Switch video through here. We might as well all enjoy this. 
WARNE [OC]: Cutting you in now, sir. 
(Hermack is aghast.) 
HERMACK: That's an Issigri ship! Flash out! Flash out! 
WARNE [on monitor]: Contact broken. 
HERMACK: You didn't fire at her? 
WARNE [on monitor]: No, sir. I was just in range when I got the flash out. What's gone wrong? 
HERMACK: We nearly wiped out one of the Issigri Mining Company's new freighters. 
WARNE [on monitor]: You mean to say that wasn't the pirate ship? Then where's it got to? 
HERMACK: I don't know. Anyway, we'll abort the mission. You'd better return.

[Mine chamber]

(The Doctor is busy with his tuning fork.) 
JAMIE: Oh, look, Doctor, will you stop it? 
ZOE: What's that noise? It's getting on everybody's nerves. 
DOCTOR: You want to get out of here, don't you? 
JAMIE: Oh, that's not going to get us out. 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, it is! An audio lock is a simple solenoid switch which is only activated by a particular sound. It's just a question of finding it, that's all. 
JAMIE: Oh look, I can't stand any more! 
DOCTOR: Jamie! Jamie! 
(Jamie snatches the tuning fork and throws it down. A section of wall slides open.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, you found the right note! 
ZOE: Oh come on, we can get away now. 
DOCTOR: Oh no, we can't. 
JAMIE: What? 
(Milo Clancey is on the other side, with his gun.) 
MILO: I've been trying to find my way in here for the last hour. Now, come on now! 
JAMIE: Come on where? 
MILO: What's the matter with you, boy? You don't think I'm in cahoots with the pirates, do you? 
DOCTOR: Well they're here, you know. We've seen them. 
MILO: I know. They've got nothing to do with me. 
DOCTOR: Well, it might help if you didn't point that thing in our direction. 
(Milo lowers his gun.) 
MILO: Oh, come on now. If I was in cahoots with the pirates, why would I be trying to rescue you? 
ZOE: We don't know that you are trying to rescue us. 
JAMIE: No. 
MILO: Oh, that's a fine thing to say, isn't it. Didn't I get you off that beacon? You would have died if I hadn't helped you then. 
JAMIE: Aye, you only got us off of there because you were curious to know who we were. 
ZOE: And that Space Corp ship opened fire on you. 
JAMIE: Hmm. 
MILO: If that don't beat jumping grasshoppers. You listen to me, you three sourpusses. You're only in this pickle now because you did the very thing I told you not to do. You went wandering off into these mine workings. I've had a whale of a time trying to find you, and if you want to get out of here alive, Milo Clancey is the only person who can show you the way. Now, you either come with me, or am I going to leave you here to rot? 
DOCTOR: Well, well, well, yes, yes, if you put it that way. 
MILO: Right. Good thinking. It's about time one of you showed a bit of sense. Who's this? 
SORBA: My name is Sorba. Lieutenant Sorba. 
JAMIE: Aye. The pirates took him prisoner when they attacked the beacon. 
MILO: Oh, there's no love lost between me and the Space Corp, Sonny Jim, but, well, you'd better come with us, I guess. 
DOCTOR: Shush, shush, there's somebody coming. 
MILO: Keep back there. 
(They all crouch against the wall as the footsteps come closer.) 
GUARD [OC]: The door's open! 
(Two guards rush in. Milo shoots one.) 
SORBA: Take his gun. It might come in useful. 
JAMIE: Right. 
(The other guard escapes.) 
MILO: Tarnation take it! A couple of years ago I'd have nailed him before he got ten yards. 
DOCTOR: What, you mean he got away? 
MILO: Aye he did. It means we're in real trouble. There'll be guards swarming round that tunnel now like a buzz of bees! 
ZOE: Well, we'd better get away. hadn't we? 
MILO: We sure had. Come on! 
(An alarm sounds.) 
JAMIE: What's that? 
MILO: I told you. That's the alarm signal. Now, come on, let's get out of here. Quick. 
DOCTOR: Yes, all right.

[Mine shaft HQ]

CAVEN: Where are they now? 
GUARD [OC]: They've gone through into the small bore workings on level eight. I've sent five men after them. 
CAVEN: I thought I told you to cordon off those lower caverns. 
GUARD [OC]: Yes, well, they got through somehow. They must have used one of the old ventilators. They seem to know their way better than our own guards. 
CAVEN: Milo Clancey. 
GUARD [OC]: What was that Chief? 
CAVEN: There's only one man who can get through these tunnels like that. All right, Jupiter, I'm coming down! I want these people either caught or killed. I don't care which, you understand? 
GUARD [OC]: Just a minute, Chief. They've just passed the perimeter eye on level six. 
CAVEN: Level six already? All right, listen. I want every man up to level three. Use the elevators. I want every entrance to that level sealed off, and it had better done by the time I get there.

[Mine shaft]

(Milo is leading everyone up a steep narrow section.) 
JAMIE: Milo? 
MILO: What? 
JAMIE: Can we rest a moment? 
MILO: Why? 
SORBA: No, no, don't bother with me. I'm all right. 
ZOE: Oh well, I want a rest, anyway. It's this climbing. 
MILO: Well, just for a minute, then. Remember, they're closing in on us all the time we stay here. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear. Where are we heading for, Milo? 
MILO: The Issigri Mining Company. We got to get to their headquarters. It's only a couple of levels from here now. 
ZOE: But didn't you say that Madeleine Issigri was your sworn enemy? 
MILO: Yeah, well, I thought she was. I thought it was her lot that was behind all this piracy trying to do me out of business. 
DOCTOR: You've changed your mind. Why? 
MILO: Well, I thought Madeleine blamed me for her father's death. Poor old Dom. He just disappeared. Years ago now. I wasn't even here at the time. And then all this piracy started and Madeleine started to find argonite in workings that Dom and I had abandoned years ago. Well, it all seemed to fit together somehow. 
ZOE: Yes, well, it fits together a bit too well, if you ask me. Aren't we jumping out of the frying pan into the fire? 
MILO: No! No! When I followed you down that shaft I recognised the leader of these pirates. He's a murderous criminal called Maurice Caven. 
DOCTOR: You know this man? 
MILO: Yeah, I've seen his picture on home planet. He's notorious. 
JAMIE: Someone's coming. 
MILO: Come on, let's get out of here. Come on.

[Another mine shaft]

(Milo and the Doctor are almost carrying Sorba. Jamie is bringing up the rear, carrying the guard's gun.) 
MILO: Hey, come on there. Come on. 
SORBA: It's no use. 
MILO: Well come on. We're almost there now. 
SORBA: I'll never make it. You go on. 
MILO: No, we've got you this far, we're not going to leave you here. 
DOCTOR: We can't carry him, Milo. 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, they're not far behind us! 
JAMIE: Aye, well they won't get much further, don't worry. 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie. Come back. 
(Jamie goes back down the tunnel) 
MILO: He won't hold them off for long. He got no recharge units for that gun. 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, can't you think of something? 
DOCTOR: I'm not a magician Zoe, I. What's this? 
MILO: It's an old power distributor box, I think. We got one on every level. 
DOCTOR: Really? Oh. Well, I wonder if it's connected up? Oh! 
ZOE: Yes, it's connected. 
(Jamie takes cover behind a boulder and shoots an approaching pirate. Caven and the others take cover.) 
DOCTOR: Zoe, attach these to that metal ring there, do you see? 
ZOE: Yes, all right, but hurry, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: I am hurrying! 
MILO: What's this contraption supposed to do Doctor, trip them up? 
(Caven waves his men forward. Jamie shoots another pirate. Then he runs out of power so he throws the gun away and creeps back along the tunnel carefully. The power cable runs across the tunnel floor.) 
DOCTOR: Right. Right, over the wire. 
MILO: What? 
DOCTOR: Come on. That's it. Now, I'm going to I'm going to test it, so stand clear. 
(The Doctor flicks a switch.) 
MILO: Is that all? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think it's working. Right, now you two, you carry along. I'll stay here and help Jamie. 
(Zoe and Milo leave, supporting Sorba.) 
JAMIE: Doctor! They're right behind me. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, wait! 
JAMIE: What? 
(The Doctor turns off the power.) 
DOCTOR: Right. Look! Stand clear. 
(Jamie steps over the cable and the Doctor switches the power back on.) 
JAMIE: Here they come! 
(The Doctor and Jamie run after Milo and Zoe. The first pirate reaches the cable. There is a flash and he falls.) 
CAVEN: What is this?

[Issigri Mining office]

(The Doctor, Milo, Zoe, Jamie and Sorba enter.) 
MADELEINE: I thought it was some sort of joke when my company guards told me that Milo Clancey was on his way up in the main elevator. Who are your friends? 
MILO: No joke, girl. Now look, will you do one thing for me before you start asking me any fool questions? 
MADELEINE: What? 
MILO: I want you to get onto General Hermack, and get him to get that V-ship here as soon as he can. 
MADELEINE: Why? 
MILO: There you go, asking questions! Because you're harbouring a nest of vipers down there in those mine workings, and they're on their way up here at this very moment. 
DOCTOR: He means that the argonite pirates are using the old mine workings as a secret hideout. 
MADELEINE: Argonite pirates? Oh really. 
MILO: Oh, child, will you listen to me!

[Another mine shaft]

(Caven destroys the power box.) 
CAVEN: Right, come on!

[Issigri Mining office]

MADELEINE: If what you say is true, and I don't believe it for one moment. 
MILO: Mean to say that you don't know of this fiend Caven? You don't know what kind of villain he is? 
MADELEINE: Well, if he is using the old mine workings as you say, then my company guards can perfectly easily take care of him. 
MILO: Look, child, he's got a whole army of thugs out there! 
MADELEINE: I assure you there's no need to call in the Space Corps. I can deal with it. 
MILO: You're an idiot, girl. She's as stubborn as her old man. Now look here child! Your guards wouldn't last five minutes against that gang of thugs out there. Now look, I am going to contact General Hermack whether you want me to or not! 
MADELEINE: Stop! Don't touch that call button, Milo. 
(Caven and his men burst in. Sorba goes for them and is shot down.) 
CAVEN: Anybody else want to die like a hero? You must have walked in here with your eyes wide open, Clancey. How very naive of you.

Episode Five

[Issigri Mining office]

MADELEINE: Wait! I never agreed to anything like this. 
CAVEN: If you don't like it, step outside for a moment. 
MADELEINE: I don't want any more killing. 
CAVEN: Too bad. 
MADELEINE: I warn you, Caven, don't overreach yourself. 
CAVEN: I never do that. 
MADELEINE: Well then, just remember I'm still running this operation. 
CAVEN: Are you? I do all the dirty work. The space piracy, the capital larceny 
MILO: The first degree homicides! 
CAVEN: Right, Clancey. While all you do is sit there looking pretty and count the money. But that doesn't mean to say you're not guilty. 
MADELEINE: Maybe, but I never agreed to murder. 
CAVEN: Well, you'd better agree to it, because if we don't get rid of these snoops, we'll both end up in a nirvan chamber. 
MADELEINE: I don't want them killed! There must be some other solution. 
DOCTOR: Yes, there's just got to be. CAVEN: Dyce. 
(Caven turns away, and the Doctor and Milo realise Jamie is going to attack a guard. They grab him.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
JAMIE: Let go of me! 
ZOE: You don't stand a chance. 
(Jamie relaxes. Caven whispers to one of his men, who goes over to the prisoners.) 
GUARD: Come on, hurry up. Out of the line. Move yourselves. 
DOCTOR: All right, there's no need to shout. 
MADELEINE: What are you going to do with them? 
CAVEN: Don't worry, they're not going to be shot. 
MADELEINE: I don't trust you, Caven. 
CAVEN: I told Fraze to lock them away under the dock complex. Ask him if you don't believe me. 
(The Doctor and Co. are taken from the room.) 
MADELEINE: What made you change your mind all of a sudden? 
CAVEN: I had a better idea, that's all. 
MADELEINE: Oh yes? 
CAVEN: That Space Corps ship is becoming a nuisance. I've thought of a way of getting rid of it.

[V-Ship flight deck]

WARNE [on monitor]: I tracked the sections of the beacon right into Lobos, sir. 
HERMACK: Were they being collected? 
WARNE [on monitor]: No, sir. They were in orbit round the planet. I made a landing at Clancey's base but it looked pretty derelict to me. 
HERMACK: No sign of Clancey himself? 
WARNE [on monitor]: No, sir. I talked to some of the mining crew. They said he took off several weeks ago. They haven't heard from him since. 
HERMACK: Are you sure they're speaking the truth? 
WARNE [on monitor]: I'm sure they are, sir. I made a pretty close reconnaissance of the area, and there's no pad installation big enough to take a Beta Dart the size the pirates use, sir. 
HERMACK: If there is one, it's certain to be camouflaged. 
WARNE [on monitor]: Well, I checked for radiation traces, sir. No, I'd say that that planet has not been used by a ship with atomic drive. 
HERMACK: But the sections of Alpha Four are in collection orbit around Lobos? How do you explain that? 
WARNE [on monitor]: Well, it's possibly been done to side-track us, sir, to put us off the pirates' real base. 
HERMACK: All right, Ian. We'll move in and find them. Bring that Minnow in. 
WARNE [on monitor]: I'm on my way home, sir. 
HERMACK: Penn! 
PENN: Sir? 
HERMACK: I've called in X X 2. Give Major Warne a beacon signal to home on. 
PENN: Yes, sir. 
HERMACK: Penn, Major Warne thinks those beacon sections were diverted to Lobos to mislead us. What was their course when our scanners first picked them up? 
PENN: I've got the plots on the computer, sir. That's their original course. 
HERMACK: Hm. Can you project a destination from that data? 
PENN: I'm just doing that sir. On that course, the beacon sections would eventually have been drawn into an elliptical orbit around the planet of Ta. 
HERMACK: Ta! I see. Thank you, Penn.

[Corridor]

(The prisoners are being taken along a metal corridor lined with pipes and cables.) 
ZOE: Where are you taking us? 
GUARD: Shut up! 
(A guard unlocks a heavy metal door and gestures for them to go in.) 
DOCTOR: Has anyone got a light? It's very dark in there. 
MILO: We're right under the freighter dock. 
GUARD: Hurry up! Inside!

[Issigri's study]

(The room has been decorated like an Edwardian study. A light from a ventilation grille illuminates a portrait.) 
MILO: Land sakes alive! It's Dom himself! 
DOCTOR: What? 
MILO: That picture. It's Dom Issigri! 
ZOE: Madeleine's father? 
MILO: Yeah. Well, wait a moment now. This. Yeah. This is the old fellow's private study. Land sakes, it's years since I've been in here. 
DOCTOR: You don't happen to remember where the light switch is, do you Milo? 
MILO: You won't find a light switch, Doctor. You might find some candles, or something. 
JAMIE: Candles? 
MILO: Yeah. 
JAMIE: In this day and age? 
MILO: Or an oil lamp or something. Hey boy, look in that cupboard, you might find something. Yeah, yeah. He was an old-fashioned romantic old critter, was old Dom. He brought all this furniture, he brought all them books and everything from Earth, you know. 
ZOE: Are these candles? 
DOCTOR: Ah, well done, Zoe. Yes, a whole box of them. 
ZOE: Well, how do they work? 
JAMIE: How do they work? 
DOCTOR: You take them and I'll show you. 
JAMIE: Hey, we need a flint box. 
DOCTOR: All right, Jamie, I've got some matches. Now, you just light the wick, you see, Zoe, and the wax allows the wick to burn fairly slowly. There we are. My word. Good lord! This is very interesting. 
(There is a gramophone player, an old radio set and a grandfather clock ticking away to itself.) 
MILO: Hey, Doctor. You know there's one thing I can't quite understand. It is why Madeleine let Caven put us in here. 
ZOE: Why? 
MILO: Well, like I said, this used to be the old fellow's private study, and she had it all locked up, so I was told, when he disappeared. She swore that nobody would ever come in here again. 
JAMIE: Nobody has. Look at the dust everywhere. Look. 
DOCTOR: I think somebody's been in here quite recently. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
MILO: Well, why do you say that, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: This clock. 
JAMIE: Well, what about it? 
DOCTOR: It's an eight day movement, Jamie. 
MILO: Well, why would anyone come down here just to wind a clock? 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I'm wondering. 
ZOE: Oh! Oh, Doctor! 
DOCTOR: What is it? 
ZOE: Doctor, look! 
(A bare foot is sticking out from beneath a covered table. The Doctor removes the cloth to reveal a frightened old man.) 
DOM: Don't hurt me, please.

[Issigri Mining office]

DERVISH [on monitor]: Beta Buccaneer to Control. We are now in landing orbit. Give me clearance to pad. 
CAVEN: Hello, Dervish. Bring the ship down on Pad three. Got that? 
DERVISH [on monitor]: Pad three. Right. 
(Transmission ends.) 
CAVEN: The nose cone worked, by the way. It put the Space Corps right off the scent. 
MADELEINE: Hermack's men'll be back though. I mean it's only a matter of time before he realises there's nothing on Lobos and the pirates must be based here. 
CAVEN: Do you think I haven't anticipated that? 
MADELEINE: Oughtn't we to put our emergency plan into operation? 
CAVEN: Flood the workings, lose all our equipment? 
MADELEINE: We've got no alternative. Hermack's men will find our argonite smelting plant, and we'll be ferried back to home planet to face a capital charge. 
CAVEN: I think we do have an alternative, and if it works we'll be in a position to re-start operations. After a discreet interval, of course. 
MADELEINE: What exactly did you have in mind? 
CAVEN: Hermack thinks that Clancey is behind the space piracy. We found his old ship, the Liz, in an abandoned freighter dock. I'm going to have it fitted with an overriding remote control. Then we'll put Clancey and his friends aboard, and boost them into orbit just when Hermack's V-ship comes into scanner range. 
HERMACK: So that they pick Clancey up? But that's crazy! He'll tell him everything, he'll blow the 
CAVEN: Don't worry. The Space Corp won't get a word out of Clancey, or those friends of his. 
MADELEINE: No! I will not be party to murder. When all this started it was going to be a salvage operation. Space flotsam, you said. But then piracy and now murder? 
CAVEN: You're taking a cut out of the profits. 
MADELEINE: Yes, but because it's too late. I'm involved. 
CAVEN: You wanted to get rid of Clancey. I'm proposing to do it permanently. 
MADELEINE: By cold blooded, deliberate murder. No! I will not let you do it! 
CAVEN: I don't think you've got much choice. 
MADELEINE: Are you threatening me? 
CAVEN: You may be the head of the Issigri Mining Company and very important back on Earth, but on this planet I have twice as many men as you and mine are all armed. I don't have to make threats. I'm telling you not to interfere. 
(Dervish enters.) 
CAVEN: Ah, Dervish, we're discussing a space accident. 
DERVISH: Oh, where? 
CAVEN: I haven't quite decided where it'll take place yet. 
DERVISH: I'm sorry, I don't get it. 
CAVEN: Don't worry. I want you to go down to the abandoned freighter dock, Dervish. You'll find an old C class ship there on the pad. Take some men with you and fit it out with a remote control guidance unit. 
DERVISH: What, now? But look, Caven, I've only just got back. 
CAVEN: This is important, Dervish. 
DERVISH: All right, if you say so. What's it for? 
CAVEN: Don't ask questions. Get on with it. 
DERVISH: Right. 
CAVEN: Oh, and by the way. 
DERVISH: Yes? 
CAVEN: It's a very old ship, did I say that? Practically falling apart. I want the oxygen pump rigged so that it does full apart, say about five minutes after blast off.

[Issigri's study]

(Jamie restrains the old man, who is thrashing in terror.) 
MILO: Dom. Dom, look at me. Don't you know me, Dom? It's me, Milo. Milo Clancey, Dom. I'm your old partner. 
DOM: No! Leave me! Leave me be! No! Don't hurt me! Not again! Please! 
ZOE: Are you sure it's Dom Issigri? 
MILO: Of course it's Dom Issigri. I was closer to that man than a brother for fifteen years. It's Dom, all right. What in the world have they done to him? 
DOCTOR: Jamie? Jamie, let him go. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: Well, he's obviously so frightened. We can't make him worse. Look out. 
MILO: Dom. Dom. 
(Issigri backs into a corner.) 
MILO: What in the world has happened to him? 
DOCTOR: Well, you can't expect him to behave normally. We don't know how long he's been down here. 
MILO: But listen, Maddie wouldn't have done a thing like this to him. 
JAMIE: Not her own father. 
DOCTOR: Milo, go and talk to him quietly. 
MILO: Ah, well yeah. Yeah, yeah, all right, I'll do that. Hey listen, what am I going to talk to him about? 
DOCTOR: Talk to him about the things that he might remember. 
MILO: Well, oh yeah. Yeah. Now, Dom. Now, now, it's only Milo, Dom. It's Milo, your old partner, Dom. All right. Hey listen, Dom. I've still got the Liz. You know, Dom? Remember the old Liz we used to thrash from here to home planet in? Remember that time we had to race those three ships in order to register our stake on Lobos? You remember that race, Dom? 
(Milo takes a crumples photograph from his pocket.) 
MILO: Wasn't that when little Madeleine was born? 
DOM: Maddie? 
MILO: Yeah. Remember that? We made that record return trip. It took them it took them fifteen years to beat the time we did then, Dom. I thought the old Liz was going to split into two. Remember, Dom? 
DOM: Maddie. Madeleine. 
MILO: That's her, Dom. That's her. That's your daughter, Dom. Why, she must have been about six year old when that was 
DOM: Five. Only five. Ah, poor Madeleine. Madeleine. 
MILO: Ah, well Dom. What about that other picture you had? That coloured picture you had of her. You know, Madeleine in a in a red dress? Have you still got that picture, Dom?

[Corridor]

(Outside, Madeleine walks up to the guard.) 
MADELEINE: Where are those prisoners? 
GUARD: Safe and sound. 
MADELEINE: In there? What are they doing in there? That is my father's study! I gave orders for that door to be kept locked! 
GUARD: Chief said to put them in there. 
MADELEINE: Caven? Give me the key. 
GUARD: Chief says nobody's to enter. 
MADELEINE: Look, you know who I am. I'm ordering you to give me that key. 
GUARD: I can't do that. Sorry. 
MADELEINE: You will be. (Madeleine leaves. The guard calls to a colleague.) 
GUARD: Fraze, here a minute. Go and tell the chief Miss Issigri's been down here trying to get in to see the prisoners. And tell him she's in a flaming temper about it!

[Issigri's study]

DOM: It is. Milo Clancey! It's Milo! 
MILO: It is, Dom, it is. Old Milo, Dom. Hey, come on, come on, old fellow. You sit down here where you'll be nice and comfortable. Now there you are, come on. I'll tell you something, Dom. We're all friends here. 
DOM: Friends? So he's caught you too. He's caught us all of us. 
DOCTOR: You mean Caven? 
DOM: You'll never get out of here. Never. You'll all die here, I tell you. 
DOCTOR: I think we shall get out of here. How long have you been down here? 
DOM: How long? I don't know how long. Years! They came for me by night, with guns. 
ZOE: Who did? 
MILO: Dom, now, was it Caven, Dom? 
DOM: You know Caven? 
MILO: Yeah. 
DOM: He's evil. Ruthless. They brought me down here and kept me like a rat under ground. 
MILO: That explains how he disappeared. Caven kidnapped him. 
JAMIE: Well, why do that? 
MILO: Because he wanted to drive a wedge between Madeleine and me. He wanted to take over the company. 
JAMIE: I know, but why keep him prisoner all this time? I mean, surely it would be easier for them to have killed him and be done with it. 
DOCTOR: Well, from what we've seen of Caven, I think he always has a good reason for doing things, Jamie. 
ZOE: You mean Mister Issigri is still of some value to Caven in some way? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so, Zoe. Well, Dom, we shall just have to escape, won't we? 
DOM: Escape? That door's the only way out of here. 
DOCTOR: Are you quite sure? 
MILO: What? Of course he's quite sure. Old Dom, he built this room. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
MILO: He hacked it out of the living rock. That door's the only way out. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but it's also the only way in.

[Issigri Mining office]

DERVISH: You'll find this ship out at the old freighter dock beyond the perimeter. Use one of the tractors to get the stuff out there and hurry. I need it quickly. And don't forget the thermic capacitators. 
(Madeleine enters.) 
MADELEINE: Where's Caven? 
DERVISH: Oh, he's on level three, I think. One of the guards just came in asking for him. 
MADELEINE: Guards. Moronic brutes. 
DERVISH: Well. 
MADELEINE: Look, Dervish, you're an intelligent man, a qualified astroengineer. How did you get mixed up with a criminal like Caven? 
DERVISH: I made a mistake once. Just once. Caven found out about it. 
MADELEINE: There must be a way. There must be a way of fighting him. I didn't realise what I'd got involved with until I saw him shoot that man today. 
DERVISH: Oh, you can't fight Caven. 
MADELEINE: Not alone, but if you help me we might be able to 
DERVISH: No! Look, I don't want to talk about it. I know Caven. I know what he's capable of. And believe me, he'd kill us both if he even suspected we were talking like this. 
MADELEINE: You've got to help me! We're the only two who could stop him! 
DERVISH: I'm sorry. 
MADELEINE: He's planning to kill those prisoners, Dervish! We can't let him murder four innocent people. 
DERVISH: Oh please, let me go! I've got work to do. 
MADELEINE: You'll be as guilty as he is! 
(Dervish leaves. Madeleine goes to the video communicator.) 
MADELEINE: This is Issigri Control to V-ship forty one. Issigri Control to General Hermack. Hello, Space Corps. If you hear me, please come in on band three nine six. This is Issigri Control.

[V-Ship flight deck]

PENN: Sir! 
WARNE: What is it, Penn? 
PENN: Radio call from Issigri Control. 
HERMACK: What do they want? 
PENN: It's a woman's voice, sir. Very faint. I'll put it through the amplifier. 
MADELEINE [OC]: Issigri Control calling General Hermack. Please come in! Band three nine six! Issigri Control calling Space Corps. 
HERMACK: Did you get that band, Penn? 
PENN: Coming up on the video, sir. 
HERMACK: V-Master to Issigri Control, receiving you now. 
MADELEINE [on viewscreen]: Listen, General. You must get 
(Transmission ends.) 
HERMACK: What the blue blazes? Open that connection again, Penn! 
PENN: It's still open, sir. Somebody's pulled the plug at the other end!

[Issigri Mining office]

CAVEN: Obviously I got here just in time. And why did you try to see the prisoners? 
MADELEINE: Why'd you think? To tell them what you're planning. 
CAVEN: So, I can't rely on you any more. 
MADELEINE: No. You'd better put me in with them. 
CAVEN: Oh, no. You've not yet outlived your usefulness. 
MADELEINE: If you think, if you think for one moment that I'm going to help you in any way. 
CAVEN: You are going to do exactly as I tell you, Madeleine. 
MADELEINE: You really are mad, aren't you. 
CAVEN: Because if you don't, I'll have your father flogged. And I ought to tell you that he's not in the best of health. 
MADELEINE: Oh, but my father's dead! 
CAVEN: He's alive. As you can perhaps see from this photograph taken only a few weeks ago. I thought I might need a lever to help you to co-operate. 
MADELEINE: Where is he? 
CAVEN: In his study, where else? When you ordered that room to be kept locked, I thought it'd be the safest place to put him. 
MADELEINE: You? Let me through! What have you done with my father? Let me see him! Let me see him. Please let me. 
CAVEN: Before we get that far, let's talk about how you're going to help me, shall we? Because that's much more important.

[V-Ship flight deck]

PENN: It's no use, sir. There's not a peep out of Issigri Control. 
HERMACK: What do you think, Ian? 
WARNE: I'd have given a lot to have held that contact for another ten seconds, sir. I wonder what she was going to say? 
HERMACK: She looked worried. 
WARNE: Sir, if those sections of the beacons were originally on course for Ta. 
HERMACK: So they were, according to our computer readings. 
WARNE: Well, suppose Clancey diverted them to Lobos, to get us out of the way so that his gang could raid the Issigri Headquarters. 
HERMACK: That would be a big operation, even for a crew as well disciplined as the pirates appear to be. 
WARNE: Well, not if he had a base on another planet, sir. 
HERMACK: I suppose it's possible. Penn, set course for Ta. 
PENN: Right, sir. 
HERMACK: We can swing back there and make sure that everything's in order anyway.

[Issigri's study]

DOCTOR: Dom, the grille over the door. 
DOM: Leads out to the passage outside. And that steel is three inches thick. I tell you it's hopeless. I spent my first year down here working on that hinge. You can see it's hardly marked. 
DOCTOR: I wasn't thinking of brute strength. Well, well not much brute strength. 
JAMIE: It's not an audio lock, is it? 
DOCTOR: No, Jamie, it isn't. 
JAMIE: Ah, that's a relief. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, I think you don't appreciate all I do for you. Milo? 
MILO: Yeah? 
DOCTOR: Supposing we could get out of this room, do you think you could find your way back to your spaceship? 
MILO: Well yeah, if you want to get me out of this room. 
DOCTOR: Shush! 
MILO: What? Ah, well, that's what I was going to say. You see, apart from these guards there. If we can get past those guards, well, they wouldn't track us down in those tunnels. I know those tunnels like the back of my hand. 
DOCTOR: Splendid! Right, Zoe, hand out those candles. Two at a time will do. 
JAMIE: What for? 
DOCTOR: Just a minute, Jamie. I'll tell you. Now, where did I put my bag of marbles?

[Issigri Mining office]

MADELEINE: I'm sorry, General. We had a technical failure. 
HERMACK [on monitor]: Is that what happened. You went out in mid-message. 
MADELEINE: Yes, I was just saying that you must get these pirates soon, General. One of my freighters has just landed, and the Captain says that his ship was attacked. 
HERMACK [on monitor]: Really? Where was this? 
MADELEINE: Just on entering the sector, he tells me, but he was able to out-run them. 
HERMACK [on monitor]: Ah, you had us worried. We're heading back to your planet now. 
MADELEINE: That's quite unnecessary, General. There's nothing wrong here. 
HERMACK [on monitor]: Oh, I'm glad to hear it. Well, we've got some checking to do there anyway. 
MADELEINE: I see. Well then, I'll get a landing pad cleared for you. 
HERMACK [on monitor]: Fine. And thank you for contacting us. 
(Transmission ends.) 
MADELEINE: Satisfied? 
CAVEN: Yes, but you shouldn't have tried to divert them. I'm counting on that ship returning. Dervish, how are things coming along? 
DERVISH [on monitor]: We've completed installation. I'm running a test on it now. 
CAVEN: Good, let me know as soon as you're ready.

[Issigri's study]

(Just inside the study doorway, a layer of candle wax has been smeared across the floor. Then the Doctor pours his bag of marbles onto it.) 
DOCTOR: Right, there we are. I think that should be enough wax. 
ZOE: Are you sure it'll work? 
DOCTOR: Well, it usually does. Jamie, Jamie, pass me that marble will you? 
JAMIE: This one? 
DOCTOR: The green one. Thank you very much. It's one of my favourites. Now, what have you got, Dom? 
DOM: An old shirt and an old aeronautical journal. 
DOCTOR: That should make plenty of smoke. Right then, is everybody ready? 
(The Doctor takes the tray of articles and stands on a chair beside the door. He strikes a match while the others arm themselves.) 
DOCTOR: You all know what you have to do? 
MILO: Yeah. 
DOCTOR: Ready? 
(The Doctor sets fire to the shirt and book.)

[Corridor]

(Smoke pours from the grille.) 
GUARD: Quince! Here quick! 
(Two guards charge into the study and skid on the wax and marbles, sending them tumbling face down. Zoe smashes a vase on one while Milo and Jamie take care of the other.)

[Issigri Mining office]

CAVEN: Useless fools! You'll be punished for this! 
GUARD: It wasn't our fault, Chief. 
CAVEN: Go on! Get moving! Get after those prisoners! With any luck you'll be shot! Incompetent idiotic. Don't imagine they can get away. There's nowhere for them to go! 
MADELEINE: If you haven't caught them by the time the Space Corps get here, then you really are in trouble, aren't you. 
MULLER [OC]: Hello, Chief. Muller here. The prisoners have just been spotted on level three. 
CAVEN: Which way are they heading? 
MULLER [OC]: Towards the old freighter dock. 
CAVEN: Clancey's old space-ship, of course. Listen, Muller, don't try and stop them, you understand? Let them reach the freighter dock. 
MULLER [OC]: Okay, Chief. I'll call the patrols in. 
CAVEN: I think your friends intend to save me a lot of trouble. Once they get that old crate up into space, I can cut in the remote control any time I like. Stop their oxygen and deliver a cargo of dead pirates to General Hermack. 
MADELEINE: Caven, you can't do that! My father's with them! 
CAVEN: Yes. He'd have been better off staying where he was, wouldn't he?

[LIZ 79]

MILO: Come on, Dom. Come on, Doctor. Come on, Dom, in you go. 
DOCTOR: What's happened to Jamie and Zoe? I think I ought to go back for them MILO: Don't you worry about them. They're probably just checking up we haven't been followed. 
DOCTOR: What are you doing? 
MILO: Just getting ready for take-off. 
DOCTOR: But 
MILO: Don't worry. Come on, I won't go without them.

[Issigri Mining office]

DERVISH [on monitor]: Control reports that the V-Ship's on an approach path. 
CAVEN: Already? All right, listen. We can't afford to wait for Clancey to take that ship up. Activate the overriding unit now. 
MADELEINE: No! 
CAVEN: You understand, Dervish? Boost that crate into orbit! Immediately!

[LIZ 79]

DOCTOR: I can't understand what's happened to them. I'm going back. 
(The Doctor leaves.) 
MILO: Don't be long. Tell them to hurry! Well, heck. 
(The Liz's engines start up and the ship begins to shake.) 
MILO: That's the rocket drive! We're taking off! 
(Milo wrestles with the controls.) 
MILO: The Doctor will be burned to a frazzle in the blast!

[Mine tunnel]

(The Doctor is caught in the back blast from the rockets.) 
DOCTOR: Oh no! 
(He falls to the ground, overwhelmed by the fumes.)

Episode Six

[Mine tunnel]

(Nearby -) 
JAMIE: What's that? 
ZOE: The rocket! The Doctor's going without us! 
JAMIE: He wouldn't do! 
ZOE: Oh, come on!

[LIZ 79]

(Milo wrestles with the controls.) 
MILO: It's no good, Dom. Damn thing won't respond at all! 
DOM: What is it, Milo? What's happened? 
MILO: We've walked right into Caven's trap. 
DOM: Caven! Of course. 
MILO: The Liz is being operated by remote control. He must have installed an override unit in here somewhere.

[Mine tunnel]

JAMIE: Doctor! 
ZOE: Oh, don't lift him, Jamie. Oh, don't touch him at all. 
(The Doctor is still sprawled on the floor.) 
JAMIE: Is he all right? Zoe, is he all right? 
ZOE: His pulse is weak. He must have been caught in the blast of those rocket boosters. Oh, these fumes! Come on, let's get him out of here.

[Issigri Mining office]

CAVEN: Cut their oxygen supply. 
MADELEINE: Caven, no! 
CAVEN: You heard me, Dervish. Cut the oxygen. Kill them! 
DERVISH [on monitor]: Oxygen cut. 
MADELEINE: Please, please, I'll help you! I'll do anything.

[LIZ 79]

(The Liz is venting oxygen.) 
MILO: Hey, Dom. This must be it. These screw heads have been loosened recently. 
DOM: Milo! It's so hot. I can hardly breathe! 
(Milo glances at the air-conditioning grille.) 
MILO: The airflow. 
DOM: Huh? 
MILO: It's been cut!

[Issigri Mining office]

MADELEINE: Bring that ship down, please. Please, I'll do anything. I'll 
CAVEN: Sit down. Stop that yapping. 
(Dervish brings his remote control unit into the office where Caven is watching Milo and Dom on the monitor.) 
DERVISH: All set, boss. 
CAVEN: Still breathing. 
DERVISH: Well, they'll have enough oxygen left to last another ten minutes or so. 
CAVEN: Milo doesn't give up too easy. He's looking for the control unit. 
DERVISH: He won't find it. It's a microcircuit. It's only an inch square and it's well hidden. 
(Dom slides from his chair to the floor.) 
CAVEN: One down, one to go. 
MADELEINE: Father! 
CAVEN: Where's the Doctor and his friends? 
DERVISH: They're not there. 
CAVEN: Where are they!

[Mine tunnel]

(In a sheltered tunnel, Jamie and Zoe put the Doctor down.) 
JAMIE: That's it. Easy now. 
ZOE: That's better, the air's clearer here. Doctor? Doctor? 
(The Doctor's eyes open.) 
ZOE: Take deep breathes. And again, come on. 
DOCTOR: (coughing) Oh dear. 
JAMIE: Thank goodness for that. For a moment I thought you'd had it. 
DOCTOR: It's all right Jamie, I'm perfectly all right. 
ZOE: What happened? Why did Milo take off without us? 
DOCTOR: I don't think he intended to, Zoe. 
ZOE: Oh but he must have. How could the Liz take off otherwise? 
DOCTOR: Milo wasn't anywhere near the controls when it all happened. 
ZOE: But surely? Of course. Remote control. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think it's the only answer. 
JAMIE: What good would it do Caven, shooting you off into space in a rocket? 
DOCTOR: I'm not sure, Jamie, but we've got to find that remote control unit and save Milo and Dom. Come on. Oh. 
ZOE: Oh, now steady, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: It's all right, Zoe. I'll be all right if you don't fuss me. Come along.

[Issigri Mining office]

CAVEN: They'll be unconscious in five minutes, and dead in fifteen. The V-ship should drop alongside some ten minutes after that. Nice timing, Dervish. 
MADELEINE: Why don't you just kill them off now? Explode the rocket and have done with it. 
CAVEN: Wouldn't suit my purpose. 
DERVISH: Caven, do we have to go through with this? 
CAVEN: What's the matter, cold feet suddenly? 
DERVISH: Why can't we get away now while we've still got the chance? 
CAVEN: Hermack thinks Clancey's the man he wants. We're giving him Clancey, dead so that he can't talk and with a load of stolen argonite in his cargo bay. 
MADELEINE: Oh you've got it all worked out, haven't you. 
CAVEN: Down to the last detail. 
DERVISH: Yeah, but what about the Doctor and his friends? Suppose they get in touch with the Space Corps? 
CAVEN: They won't. I'll find them now and take care of them. And don't take any lip from her. If she gives you any trouble, kill her! 
(Caven leaves.) 
DERVISH: I don't want to, but if I have to, I'll kill you. 
(On the monitor, Milo collapses.) 
DERVISH: I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. 
MADELEINE: They don't stand a chance, do they? By the time the Space Corps gets here, they'll be dead.

[V-Ship flight deck]

(The radar screen has a blip on it.) 
HERMACK: Well, what is it? 
WARNE: Is it one of the pirate ship, a Beta Dart? 
PENN: Can't make it out yet, sir. It's too far away. 
HERMACK: Right. Full boost. Let's get in closer and have a look.

[Issigri Mining office]

DERVISH: Don't you understand? There's nothing I can do. Nothing! 
MADELEINE: This is your one chance to get free of Caven. Help me. We can get the Space Corps out so that 
DERVISH: No. I daren't. Don't move. 
(Behind Dervish, Madeleine sees the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe enter.) 
MADELEINE: All right. I can see it's pointless arguing with a gutless fool like you. You don't care about anything except your own skin. 
DERVISH: Shut up. Shut up! 
(As Dervish raises his gun, Jamie jumps him. The shot hits the remote control unit and Jamie knocks Dervish out with one punch.) 
MADELEINE: Quickly. We must do something. They've cut off the air in the Liz and my father's in there. He's dying. This is the remote control unit. 
DOCTOR: Oh my word! I'm afraid the blast from the gun has fused the wires together. 
MADELEINE: Can't you do something?

[Corridor]

CAVEN: Well? 
GUARD: There's no sign of them on this level, sir. 
CAVEN: Right, spread down on the next level by the old workings. 
GUARD: Right, sir. 
CAVEN: And if you see any sign of that Doctor and his friends, you shoot to kill. 
GUARD: Right, sir. 
CAVEN: I'll be back in the Issigri HQ. 
GUARD: Right sir.

[Issigri Mining office]

MADELEINE: Come on! Come on, please! 
DOCTOR: I think I think that's the air-conditioning circuit reconnected. Now then, the radio link. 
(Dervish wakes and starts to edge towards the door.)

[LIZ 79]

(Oxygen starts to come in through the grille.) 
DOCTOR [OC]: Hello LIZ 79. Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Dom? Dom Issigri? 
MADELEINE [OC]: Father? Father, this is Madeleine. Can you hear me? 
(But the two men are unconscious.)

[Issigri Mining office]

(Dervish hurries down a corridor.) 
MADELEINE: Are you sure the radio link's working? 
DOCTOR: Well, I think so. 
MADELEINE: What about the video? 
DOCTOR: No, this is much more difficult, I'm afraid. 
MADELEINE: How can we tell whether they're all right or not? 
DOCTOR: Well 
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor! 
DOCTOR: What is it, Jamie? I'm busy. 
JAMIE: It's Dervish. He's gone! 
DOCTOR: What? 
ZOE: Well, he's bound to bring Caven and the guards back. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
MADELEINE: I'll close the main doors, then we'll be safe. 
(She operates the door controls.) 
MADELEINE: Let's try and contact the Liz again, please.

[LIZ 79]

MADELEINE [OC]: Father, Milo, can you hear me? Milo, Father, please answer if you can hear me! 
MILO: Hey, girl! Stop screeching like a banshee, will you? 
MADELEINE [OC]: Milo? Milo, is that you? 
MILO: I'll tell you. Just let me clear the fog from me ears and I'll tell you. 
MADELEINE [OC]: Is my father all right? 
MILO: Yeah, I think he's all right, Maddie. 
HERMACK [OC]: LIZ seventy nine, this is General Hermack. 
MILO: Oh! Not another banshee! Take your volume down, will you, General? You're blasting me ears off! 
HERMACK [OC]: Clancey, cut your motors. We're coming alongside. 
MILO: Look, General, will you just shut up and let me get a word in edgeways? I've got something to tell you that'll make your hair curl. Now just for once in your life, will you listen to me?

[Corridor]

CAVEN: Dervish, I thought I told you to 
DERVISH: Caven! The Doctor and his friends, they attacked me. I was lucky to get away with my life. 
CAVEN: You fool! They'll bring the Space Corps down on us. Oh you! Come on!

[V-Ship flight deck]

HERMACK: Is this true, Clancey? 
DOM [OC]: General Hermack, this is Dom Issigri. What Milo has told you is true. Caven has engineered this whole thing. 
MILO [OC]: And if you don't stop yabbing General, he's going to get clean away with it. 
HERMACK: All right Clancey, that's quite enough of that. Get me Issigri Headquarters on the video. 
PENN: Yes, sir. 
HERMACK: Miss Issigri, we are coming to your assistance. We are going to launch a full scale attack in approximately 
PENN: Fifty five minutes, sir. 
HERMACK: Fifty five minutes.

[LIZ 79]

MADELEINE [OC]: All right, General. Thank you. 
MILO: Hey! Hey! Hey wait on, Maddie! Hey, General, wait on! What about us? You can't leave us here like flies on fly-paper. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Hello, Milo. Now listen. 
MILO: The Doctor! 
DOCTOR [OC]: I think I can help you dismantle the remote control device and regain control of the Liz. 
MILO: Get control of the Liz? That would be something. 
DOCTOR: I think the remote control unit will be probably situated somewhere in the computer preselector. Now do you know where that is? 
MILO: Well, of course I know where it is. I know the Liz like the back of my hand. Now that computer thingummy, that should be, well, somewhere about here, I guess. Ah ha! 
DOCTOR [OC]: What's happened? Have you found it? 
(Milo has tilted too far back on his chair and fallen on the floor.) 
MILO: Ah! There you go. Maybe it'll be somewhere behind here, Dom.

[Outside the Issigri Mining office]

CAVEN: They're locked from the inside. 
(Caven uses a comm link.) 
CAVEN: Madeleine.

[Issigri Mining office]

CAVEN [on monitor]: Can you hear me? This is Caven. 
MADELEINE: He's probably outside the main door. That's where the internal video is. You can't get in, Caven. By the time you cut through that door, the Space Corps will be swarming all over Ta.

[Outside the Issigri Mining office]

CAVEN: Oh dear, Madeleine, you've disappointed me. We could have made a fortune together, instead of which I have to leave and you have to die.

[Issigri Mining office]

MADELEINE: Empty threats, Caven.

[Outside the Issigri Mining office]

CAVEN: Oh no. Dervish, you'll need eighteen to twenty demolition charges. 
DERVISH: What for? 
CAVEN: Connect them in series to the atomic fuel store. 
DERVISH: But that's madness, Caven. There isn't time. The Space Corps will here before we're finished. 
CAVEN: We will finish, don't worry. 
DERVISH: Yeah, but 
CAVEN: Do as I say! 
(Dervish leaves.) 
CAVEN: Should be quite a bang. The equivalent of about eighty old-fashioned hydrogen bombs.

[Issigri Mining office]

MADELEINE: You'd never do that. You'd blow yourself sky-high as well!

[Outside the Issigri Mining office]

CAVEN: Oh no. We shall explode it when we're a safe distance away, and the V-Ship is right in the flash zone. You have about forty minutes. Oh, don't try to leave. I'm turning the manual lock on this side. Enjoy the big bang!

[Issigri Mining office]

MADELEINE: That's it. I don't think he's bluffing. And if he sets off an explosion in the atomic fuel store 
DOCTOR: Then we must see to it that he doesn't. 
JAMIE: Well, how? We can't stop him if we're locked in here. 
ZOE: What about the Space Corps? Can they get here in time? 
MADELEINE: No, V-ships require a complicated landing technique. They're so large. 
DOCTOR: Besides, we shall have to warn them of Caven's intended escape. 
JAMIE: Then who's going to get us out of here? 
DOCTOR: There's only one man who can, Jamie. Milo. 
ZOE: But the Liz is still jammed on remote control. 
DOCTOR: I know, I know, but we shall free it. 
JAMIE: You hope. 
DOCTOR: Get on to the space patrol. Tell them what's happened. I'd better see how Milo's getting on with that bird's nest.

[Atomic fuel store area]

(A long narrow corridor with lines of huge cylinders in racks. In a radiation suit, Dervish attaches tiny canisters to each cylinder. Caven watches through an inspection window. After linking each canister to a main cable, Dervish leaves the store. A clock on the wall says 11:25.) 
CAVEN: You're taking your time. 
DERVISH: Only the detonator to connect up now. 
CAVEN: Well get a move on! 
DERVISH: Do you mind? 
CAVEN: What? 
DERVISH: This is something that can't be rushed. 
(Dervish opens the box with the detonator in it. Caven grabs his shoulder.) 
DERVISH: Do that again, and we won't have half a second left. I've known one of these things go up if somebody so much as coughed! 
CAVEN: We've got half an hour before that V-ship drops on us. 
(Dervish hands the detonator to Caven, then puts on his protective gear again and takes it back. He re-enters the store.)

[V-Ship flight deck]

MADELEINE [on viewscreen]: He's planting some sort of explosive device in the atomic fuel store, with a radio control detonator. 
HERMACK: He intends to leave Ta in a Beta Dart and explode out of range. 
MADELEINE [on viewscreen]: Yes. 
HERMACK: Then we must try and intercept him before he has the chance to transmit the triggering pulse. We'll let you know, Miss Issigri, don't worry.

[LIZ 79]

(Milo is dealing with a mares nest of wires.) 
DOCTOR [OC]: Milo? Have you found that little red wire leading into the neuristor bank? 
MILO: Huh! Little red wire, he says. There's about a thousand little red wires here. You hold that bunch, will you, Dom? Now, neuristor bank? Ah, well that might be this one here. I'll give that a go there. 
(Electric shock. Milo yelps.) 
DOCTOR [OC]: It sounds as if you've found it. 
MILO: Jumping galactic gob-stoppers, why didn't you tell me it was alive! My fingers. 
DOCTOR [OC]: Now, somewhere near that neuristor bank, there should be the implanted overriding unit. It's probably transistorised. Very small. 
DOM: Is that it? 
MILO: Yeah? 
DOM: Is that it? 
MILO: Could be, Dom. We'll try that one, shall we? Right. Good. 
(Milo yanks the little device out and the Liz veers to the side.) 
DOCTOR [OC]: What's happening? 
MILO: I found it! 
DOCTOR [OC]: Right. Now, dismantle it carefully. 
MILO: I just have. Hold on a second, Dom. We're on our way!

[Atomic fuel store area]

(Dervish has connected the main cable to the detonator unit. He wires that to a radio control box and comes out of the fuel store proper.) 
DERVISH: All fixed. 
CAVEN: Good! By twelve hundred hours we'll be far enough away to escape the blast. 
DERVISH: Is the ship ready? 
CAVEN: On the pad. Come on, let's go. 
(The clock on the wall says 11:40.)

[V-Ship flight deck]

WARNE: That's a Beta Dart on the scope now, isn't it, Penn? 
PENN: Must be, sir. She's boosting off fast. 
HERMACK: Get a Minnow, Ian, and get after them. 
WARNE: Right, sir. 
HERMACK: Lock onto an intercepting course. 
PENN: Yes, sir.

[LIZ 79]

MILO: This is just like old times, hey, Dom? You and me scuffling along in the old Liz. 
DOM: If I were a little less old, I 
MILO: Hold on, Dom. You'll be all right. Look, in a minute or two, we're going to land on Ta. You'll see little Maddie again, Dom. 
DOM: Little Maddie? 
MILO: Maddie. 
DOM: Yes, yes, Maddie. Maddie. 
MILO: Hold onto something, Dom. Hold on, I'm going to try and approach orbit. Come on, old girl. Don't let me down now.

[V-Ship flight deck]

WARNE [on monitor]: I shall be in striking range in about thirty seconds, sir. 
HERMACK: Right! Don't fire until I give the word. No, wait a minute, there's an audio contact. 
CAVEN [OC]: Beta Dart to V-forty one. Call that Minnow off our tail, Hermack. I'm warning you, if he comes any closer I'll pull this switch and we'll all die together. 
HERMACK: You'd better pull back, Ian. 
WARNE [on monitor]: Okay, sir, if you say so. 
HERMACK: Twelve minutes. Give me Issigri Headquarters. I'd better break the news to them.

[LIZ 79]

MILO: We did it! We did it, Dom. We're all right. We're down, Dom. 
MADELEINE [OC]: Hello, LIZ seventy nine. Milo, can you hear me? 
MILO: Yeah, loud and clear. We'll be seeing you in a minute, Maddie girl, because we've landed. 
MADELEINE [OC]: Thank goodness for that. Now listen, Milo, there isn't much time. You've got to get over to Headquarters and release us quickly. 
MILO: But why? What's going on? 
MADELEINE: There's no time for questions! Hurry! 
MILO: Righto! You'd better stay down there, old timer. I've got some running to do, and I don't think that you're really up to it. All right?

[V-Ship flight deck]

MADELEINE [on monitor]: The Doctor thinks that he might be able to defuse this explosive. 
HERMACK: You haven't much more time. Eight, perhaps ten minutes. I've got to launch that Beta Dart at twelve hundred. 
MADELEINE [on monitor]: All right, but give us as long as you can. 
HERMACK: Good luck. You'll need it.

[Issigri Mining office]

MADELEINE: Milo! 
MILO: I haven't run so far since I was knee high to a grasshopper. Hey, what going on here? Where are you all going? 
JAMIE: To turn off a bomb. 
MILO: Oh my. A bomb?! Hey, wait for me!

[V-Ship flight deck]

WARNE [on monitor]: I could creep the Minnow in, sir, and get a salvo in before they knew what had happened. 
HERMACK: No, wait. They've got seven more minutes.

[Atomic fuel store area]

(Milo helps the Doctor into a radiation suit.) 
MADELEINE: You've got about six minutes. 
DOCTOR: Right, open the doors. 
(The Doctor goes inside and finds the detonator unit. He looks closely at it, then at the cable, then the radio control box and aerial. Then he stands still and thinks.) 
JAMIE: Look, he's not doing anything. 
ZOE: Oh, Doctor, hurry! 
MILO: Land sakes alive, girl, he's got to find the right one. He'll blow us all to bits if he moves the wrong wire. 
(Madeleine looks at the clock. 11:55. The Doctor unscrews the inspection cover of the detonation unit. 11:56. The Doctor reaches inside the remote unit and removes a waxed cartridge with wires running from it to the radio control box.

[V-Ship flight deck]

PENN: One hundred and fifty seconds, sir. 
HERMACK: We've got to take the risk. Attack, Ian, attack! 
(The Minnow homes in on the fleeing Dart. The Doctor is probing the detonator with a pair of tweezers.) 
HERMACK: Fire! 
(Two missiles streak from the Minnow towards the Beta Dart.)

[Beta Dart]

CAVEN: I warned you, Hermack. 
DERVISH [OC]: No, Caven, no! We're still in the blast area! 
CAVEN: Then we'll all die together! 
DERVISH: No! 
(A tiny light flashes on the radio control unit, but the Doctor is holding the dismantled detonator in his arms. The missiles make contact and the Dart goes KaBOOM.)

[Issigri Mining office]

MADELEINE: I've just heard that the Space Corps has destroyed the Beta Dart. 
MILO: Well, at least those varmints have done something right for a change, hey? 
MADELEINE: General Hermack is coming back here to pick me up. I have to go back to home planet. 
ZOE: What for? 
MADELEINE: To stand trial. 
MILO: To stand trial? Now listen, don't you worry about that, little Maddie girl. I'll have a few words with those fangdanglers about that. 
MADELEINE: Don't worry. The General doesn't seem to think that the outcome will be disastrous, and my father's evidence will help. 
MILO: Yeah, damn tooting it will. Poor old critter. Hey, would you like to go and have a have a word with him, Maddie girl? He's only out there on the Liz. 
MADELEINE: Yes, yes. It'll be strange seeing him after all these years. 
MILO: Go on. You go and have a word with him all by yourself. Go on. 
MADELEINE: I don't know how to thank you. 
(Madeleine leaves.) 
ZOE: Doctor? Doctor, what about the Tardis? 
JAMIE: Hey, that's a point. Where is it? 
DOCTOR: Oh, the Tardis. Well, that's no problem. It's orbiting Lobos, Milo's home planet, in one of the beacon sections. 
ZOE: Oh no problem, hey? Well, how are we going to get to it? 
DOCTOR: Milo's very kindly offered us a lift in the Liz. 
JAMIE: Oh no, not the Liz again. Frankly, I'd rather walk. 
MILO: You what? 
DOCTOR: You never know. You might have to.

[No Man's Land]

(A scene of mud and desolation. The Tardis materialises in a puddle, and Jamie steps out into it. Zoe is sensibly wearing a trench coat, jodhpurs and knee high boots.) 
JAMIE: What a place. 
ZOE: Where are we? Earth? 
DOCTOR: Well, it looks like it, Zoe. Come on. 
(They pick their way over and up a slope. The Doctor whistles 'A-hunting we will go' happily to himself.) 
ZOE: What's this stuff? 
JAMIE: Aye, wee spikes. 
(Jamie pricks his finger.) 
DOCTOR: Barbed wire, Jamie. It's filthy stuff. I thought so. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
(The Doctor pulls a tin helmet from underneath some wood.) 
JAMIE: Where are we? 
DOCTOR: We're back in history, Jamie. One of the most terrible times on the planet Earth. 
(Whee, boom!) 
DOCTOR: Quick! Down there! 
(They dive into a nearby bomb crater in the ground. Another shell explodes nearby as Jamie stands to watch.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
(More explosions and machine gun fire. They get splattered with soil. An army ambulance comes trundling up through the explosions, then suddenly all goes quiet. A woman in a great coat is standing by the crater.) 
BUCKINGHAM: I say, are you all right? 
DOCTOR: Well, yes, I think so. 
BUCKINGHAM: I shouldn't stay around here if I were you. That was just the softening up barrage. 
DOCTOR: What? 
JAMIE: Eh? 
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh my. Oh. 
BUCKINGHAM: What on earth are you doing here, anyway? This is no place for civilians. 
DOCTOR: Well, where are we? 
BUCKINGHAM: Between the lines, I think. Not quite sure myself. I'm heading for Ypres, but I seem to have got 
(Two soldiers in gas masks are standing next to them.) 
GERMAN: Hände hock. Raus schnell. 
(The four are taken at gunpoint to the ambulance and driven off. Buckingham is behind the wheel. Further on, two men come running over a rise. Buckingham stops the ambulance. The officer puts his revolver to the German's head.) 
CARSTAIRS: Out you come. 
(Played by David Savile. I used to have such a crush on him.) 
BUCKINGHAM: There's another in the back. 
CARSTAIRS: Take care of him. 
(Carstairs leaves his soldier covering the man up front and goes to the back of the ambulance. Jamie and the Doctor have already overpowered the other German.) 
CARSTAIRS: Well done. Get inside. 
(The British and German soldiers are bundled into the back. Carstairs sits next to Buckingham up front.) 
CARSTAIRS: Who are those people? 
BUCKINGHAM: No idea. Picked them up in no man's land. 
CARSTAIRS: Well, I suppose we'd better get them back to base.

[Field office]

(Adjoining the trench, Captain Blackadder is reporting up the telephone line. Explosions are heard almost constantly.) 
BARRINGTON: They've laid down a heavy barrage all along the line. I think that they're after that ammo dump. Don't worry, sir. We'll hold out. 
SERGEANT: Sir? 
BARRINGTON: What is it? 
SERGEANT: Ambulance approaching, sir. 
BARRINGTON: Give it protective fire. Jump to it. man! 
SERGEANT: Sir.

[Trench]

SERGEANT: Hold your fire! Hold it. Come on. Come on. Get down, get down. 
(Zoe makes her way behind the troops firing over the top of the trench as Carstairs helps Buckingham, the Doctor and Jamie down.) 
CARSTAIRS: Couple of prisoners, Sergeant. My men are bringing them in. 
SERGEANT: Very good, sir. 
JAMIE: How are we going to get back to the Tardis? 
DOCTOR: Now, just be quiet, Jamie, and let me do the talking.

[Field office]

SERGEANT: Sir? 
BARRINGTON: What is it now? 
SERGEANT: With the ambulance, sir, there was a Lieutenant. 
BARRINGTON: Well, bring him in. 
SERGEANT: Sir. 
(The Sergeant leaves, Carstairs enters.) 
CARSTAIRS: Lieutenant Carstairs, sir. 
BARRINGTON: What are you doing here? You don't belong to this battalion, do you? 
CARSTAIRS: No. Patrolling in no mans land, sir. I got cut off from my own lot. 
BARRINGTON: What were you doing traipsing about in ambulances? 
CARSTAIRS: Recaptured it from the Hun, sir. Lucky we arrived, really. There was a WVR driving it, and three civilians inside. 
BARRINGTON: Civilians? In no man's land? 
CARSTAIRS: Your sergeant's taking care of them, sir. 
BARRINGTON: Good grief. Civilians.

[Trench]

(The travellers have been given mugs of tea.) 
JAMIE: The thing is, where are we? 
ZOE: Early twentieth century isn't it, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm afraid that we've landed up in the middle of one of the worst wars in human history. 
JAMIE: What are they dug into the ground like this for? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's trench warfare, you see, Jamie. These trenches stretch right the way across the continent of Europe. 
JAMIE: Well, what are they fighting for? 
DOCTOR: Well, I well I believe that they call it The War to End Wars. 
ZOE: Do you think they'll let us go? 
DOCTOR: Well, they've got no reason to keep us. Here, things have calmed down a bit. Let's try and get away. 
(But as soon as he puts his head up over the top of the trench, machine gun fire.) 
DOCTOR: Oh! 
SERGEANT: What do you think you're doing? 
DOCTOR: Our transportation is over there, you see. We're trying to get to it. 
SERGEANT: Over there? There's nothing over there but Huns. Anyway, the Major wants to see you. 
DOCTOR: Oh, we don't want to bother him. I'm sure he's very busy. 
SERGEANT: Come on! You too, ma'am, if you don't mind.

[Field office]

BARRINGTON: Right, sir. We'll go over the top at oh four hundred hours. Sir. As you say, sir. Well, that was General Smythe. Big push tomorrow. How long have you been out here? 
CARSTAIRS: Well, sir, it's odd, but I can't quite remember. 
BARRINGTON: I know. It seems like forever, doesn't it? 
SERGEANT: Civilian party, sir. Major Barrington, ma'am. 
BARRINGTON: How do you do, er? 
BUCKINGHAM: Jennifer Buckingham. 
BARRINGTON: Ah. I understand you picked these people up in no man's land? 
BUCKINGHAM: Yes. Found them hiding in a bomb crater. 
BARRINGTON: I see. May I ask you what you were doing there? 
DOCTOR: Trying not to get killed. 
BARRINGTON: I see. You're a Highlander, aren't you? Why aren't you with your regiment? 
JAMIE: Regiment? I'm not in the army. 
BARRINGTON: Are you a deserter? 
JAMIE: No, of course not! I 
BARRINGTON: All right, all right. And you, what are you doing in the front line? No place for young ladies. 
ZOE: Well what about her? 
BARRINGTON: This lady's a WVR. She's here on duty. 
DOCTOR: Er, look, Major, we don't want to trouble you. If you'd just let us go on our way. 
BARRINGTON: And which way is that? 
SERGEANT: He tried to make off towards the German line, sir. 
BARRINGTON: Did he, by jove. 
(Whee, Boom! Bits of ceiling come down.) 
BARRINGTON: I think General Smythe would like to know about you. (into telephone) Get me General Smythe at base.

[British command post]

(The General sits at a simple folding table in a once great stately home, talking into a field telephone.) 
SMYTHE: Civilians? In no man's land? Yes. Well, send them back here at once. I'll question them myself. 
(The General's adjutant enters.) 
SMYTHE: Three civilians found in no man's land. 
RANSOM: Good lord. Whereabouts, sir? 
SMYTHE: Barrington's sector. He's sending them straight back here. I'm going to turn in for half an hour. 
SMYTHE: Sir. 
SMYTHE: Let me know when these civilians arrive. 
RANSOM: Yes, sir. 
(The obligatory mug of tea arrives.) 
RANSOM: Thank you, Sergeant Major.

[Smythe's room]

(A wood panelled room with a large trunk on its end in the corner. Smythe reaches for a portrait on the wall when the door opens. It's the Sergeant Major with his mug of tea.) 
SMYTHE: Don't ever come through that door without knocking! Get out! 
BURNS: Right, sir. 
(He leaves. Smythe reaches for the portrait again and it swings open on hinges to reveal a circular monitor and a dial. Smythe turns it on.) 
SMYTHE: Smythe, 1917 zone, British sector. Reinforcements urgently required. At least five thousand specimens.

[Field office]

DOCTOR: But look, Major Barrington, if only you'd let us get back to our transportation we'd be no further nuisance to you. 
BARRINGTON: I'm sorry, you must first go to the Chateau and give a proper account of yourselves. For all I know you may be spies. 
JAMIE: Oh look, we keep trying to tell you, you daft sassenach. 
BARRINGTON: Hold your tongue, man! 
JAMIE: No, I won't! 
DOCTOR: Now please! Don't let us lose our tempers. 
SERGEANT: Supply truck leaving for base now, sir. 
BARRINGTON: Good. Get them onto it. Off you go. 
JAMIE: Now, just a moment, we're not going back to any base. Now, come on. 
BARRINGTON: Sentry! 
(Jamie's exit is stopped by a soldier and rifle.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, I think perhaps we'd better do as they say. 
BARRINGTON: I'm glad one of you is showing some sense. All right, Sergeant, take them away. 
SERGEANT: Yes, sir. 
BUCKINGHAM: I'm sure you'll be all right. Anyway, good luck. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much. 
(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe leave with the Sergeant.) 
BARRINGTON: Now then, what are we going to do about you two? 
BUCKINGHAM: Could your men do something about my ambulance? It's bogged down just over the hill. 
BARRINGTON: Yes, soon get that out for you. 
(Barrington leaves.) 
BUCKINGHAM: Funny about those people. They didn't look like spies. 
CARSTAIRS: Spies never do. I don't envy them if they are. General Smythe can be pretty ruthless. Know what my chaps call him? 
BUCKINGHAM: No. 
CARSTAIRS: The Butcher.

[British command post]  

(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe are marched under escort into a large room in a faded and dilapidated Chateau. A Sergeant Major gives the orders.) 
BURNS: Right, left, right, left, right, left, right. Prisoners and escort, mark time! Halt! Right turn! Civilian prisoners from Major Barrington, sir. 
RANSOM: All right. At ease. 
BURNS: Stand at ease! 
(Jamie stamps his foot to the side, stepping on the Doctor.) 
BURNS: At ease. 
RANSOM: The General wants to question you personally. 
DOCTOR: Oh good. I'm sure we'll be able to explain everything to his satisfaction. 
JAMIE: Look, how long are we going to be kept here?

[Smythe's room]

(The room is empty.) 
RANSOM: Sir?

[British command post]

RANSOM: Take them to the cells, Sergeant Major. 
DOCTOR: But I thought you said we were going to see the General? 
RANSOM: The General is not available. Take them away. 
BURNS: Prisoners and escort, attention! Right turn! 
(No, the other right, Jamie.) 
BURNS: By the front, quick march. Left, right, left, right. 
ZOE: There's no need to keep shouting at us, you know. 
SERGEANT MAJOR: Left, right, left, right, left.

[Field office]

(Carstairs pours himself some tea from a billy can.) 
CARSTAIRS: Oh, I'm sorry, do you want some more? 
BUCKINGHAM: Thanks. 
CARSTAIRS: Where is your hospital? 
BUCKINGHAM: Oh, it's not far. 
CARSTAIRS: Whereabouts? 
BUCKINGHAM: Well, you're going to think me awfully silly, but I can't quite remember. 
CARSTAIRS: Don't worry, it'll come back to you. Memory's a funny thing out here. Can't always remember things myself. 
BUCKINGHAM: What kinds of things? 
CARSTAIRS: Oh, silly things. Names, dates, how long I've been here. Sometimes wonder if I've got a touch of the old shell shock. Have you talked to anybody else about it? 
BUCKINGHAM: Haven't liked to. One feels so stupid. 
CARSTAIRS: Yes. Still, it is rather worrying not being able to remember things. 
(The telephone rings.) 
CARSTAIRS: Ah. Suppose I'd better answer that. 
(Barrington rushes in and takes the receiver from Carstairs.) 
BARRINGTON: Ah, thanks, old man. Major Barrington. Yes. Right, sir. We're wanted at HQ. Some sort of enquiry to do with those civilians you brought in. 
BUCKINGHAM: How long will it take? I'm bound to be needed back at the hospital. 
BARRINGTON: We just got your ambulance out of the mud. We'll all go in that, and then you can go straight on from HQ. Are you ready?

[Wine cellar]

(No bottles, just racks and barrels.) 
JAMIE: And you'll not pick that lock with a hairgrip either. 
ZOE: These walls are solid stone. There's just no way out. 
JAMIE: Now what do we do, then? 
DOCTOR: It's just a temporary misunderstanding, Jamie. We'll get it cleared up when we see the General. 
ZOE: Why should he listen to us? No one else has. 
DOCTOR: Ah, they were all obeying orders, Zoe. That's the military mind. 
ZOE: We must have looked a bit suspicious. Three civilians in the middle of a war? 
JAMIE: Aye, well, I just hope that General does listen to us. 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, I expect he's a very nice chap.

[British command post]

(Smythe comes out of his room.) 
SMYTHE: Got those reports yet? 
RANSOM: Just finished now, sir. 
SMYTHE: Thank you. 
RANSOM: By the way, sir, those three civilians have turned up. I've got them in the cells. 
SMYTHE: Oh, what of it? 
RANSOM: As a matter of fact, I went into your room to tell you but 
(Smythe puts on his spectacles and stares at Ransom.) 
SMYTHE: I was asleep, Captain Ransom. You did not wish to disturb me. 
RANSOM: Yes, sir, you were asleep. I didn't wish to disturb you. 
SMYTHE: That's right. Now, what did you make of these civilians? 
RANSOM: Oh, two men and a young lady. According to Major Barrington they can't account for themselves. He seemed to think the younger lad was a deserter. Apparently the older man tried to make off for the enemy lines. 
BURNS: Sir! Major Barrington, sir. 
SMYTHE: Thanks. 
(The Sergeant Major leaves.) 
BARRINGTON: This is Lady Jennifer Buckingham, sir, and Lieutenant. 
SMYTHE: How do you do. Do sit down. 
BUCKINGHAM: Thank you. 
SMYTHE: Barrington, you know my adjutant, Ransom, don't you? 
BARRINGTON: Yes, we, er, Ransom and I were er 
(Smythe puts on his spectacles.) 
SMYTHE: You were at school together. You were at school together. 
BARRINGTON: Yes, that's right. How are you Ransom? 
SMYTHE: Now, Carstairs, tell me, where did you find these civilians? 
(Later the Kings Regulations and Orders for the Army, 1912 is opened. Ransom, Smythe and Barrington are at the little table as a Court Martial.) 
BURNS: Left, right, left, right. Escort and accused, mark time. Halt. left turn. 
DOCTOR: Major Barrington, how nice to see you. 
BURNS: Accused! Back in line. 
SMYTHE: If you are ready, gentlemen? March the prisoners forward, Sergeant Major. 
BURNS: Sir! Accused, one pace forward, march. 
JAMIE: Now, look, what's going on here? 
SMYTHE: The Court Martial is now in session. 
DOCTOR: Court Martial? But we're civilians. 
SMYTHE: This whole area is under martial law. 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, that may be, but if you'll allow me to explain, we were 
SMYTHE: You will have an opportunity of addressing the Court at the proper time. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. 
SMYTHE: Now, the statements of Lieutenant Carstairs and Lady Jennifer have been taken into evidence. The prisoners waylaid an ambulance in no man's land 
DOCTOR: Waylaid? The ambulance found us. 
SMYTHE: The vehicle was later commandeered by a waiting enemy patrol. Recaptured by Lieutenant Carstairs, the prisoners insinuated themselves into a forward command post, where at the earliest opportunity one of them made a break for the enemy lines with whatever information he had gathered. 
ZOE: Oh, but none of that's true. You've twisted the whole thing. 
DOCTOR: This is a travesty of justice. What are we charged with? 
SMYTHE: In the case of this man, desertion from a Highland regiment. 
JAMIE: But, but 
SMYTHE: In the case of yourself and the girl, the charge is one of espionage. The penalty for all these charges is death. 
DOCTOR: But this is monstrous! 
SMYTHE: We shall now hear the case for the defence. Have you anything to say? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I most certainly have! Am I allowed to question the witnesses? 
SMYTHE: Certainly. We wish to give you every opportunity to explain yourselves. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. Lady Jennifer, will you please explain to these gentlemen the circumstances of our meeting. 
SMYTHE: There's no need for that. It's in the statement. Next question. 
DOCTOR: What? Well, Lieutenant Carstairs, when your men recaptured the ambulance, wasn't it obvious to you we were prisoners of the Germans? 
SMYTHE: Has the defence finished with this witness? 
DOCTOR: Well, if you're not going to allow them to answer, what is the use? 
SMYTHE: Very well. Have you any explanation to offer before the Court passes sentence? 
ZOE: But you haven't heard anything yet. You don't really call this a trial, do you? 
SMYTHE: The Court will now consider it's verdict. 
JAMIE: Hey, you haven't even asked me anything. 
SMYTHE: There's nothing to ask you. You are a deserter! March him away, Sergeant Major! 
BURNS: Sir. Escort and accused, left turn. Left wheel, by the front, quick march! Left, right, left, right. Halt! 
JAMIE: I thought you were going to explain everything? 
DOCTOR: Well, he didn't give me a chance, did he. There's something very strangely wrong here. 
ZOE: Why has that General got it in for us? He seems determined to find us guilty. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but why? 
RANSOM: I don't know. They seem pretty harmless to me. 
BARRINGTON: Yes, there's no actual evidence of them actually spying on anything. 
(Smythe puts on his spectacles.) 
SMYTHE: It is quite clear that they are all guilty. All guilty! 
BARRINGTON: Yes, they're guilty. Knew it as soon as I looked at them. 
RANSOM: There's clear evidence that they were spying. 
SMYTHE: Thank you, gentlemen. Well, I think we can resume. Sergeant Major, bring the prisoners back. 
BURNS: Escort and accused, left wheel! By the front, quick march. Left, right, left, right, left wheel. Mark time. Halt! Right turn! 
SMYTHE: The Court has carefully considered all of the evidence and finds you all guilty as charged. Desertion in a time of war is a most heinous military crime. 
JAMIE: Look, I've deserted from nowhere! I was never in your rotten army. 
SMYTHE: You will be confined to a military barracks awaiting a regimental Court Martial. 
JAMIE: Now look, I'm not being confined anywhere. 
SMYTHE: You, young lady, have betrayed your King and country. You are sentenced to ten years penal servitude to be spent in a civilian prison. 
ZOE: Oh but I haven't done anything! 
SMYTHE: The court finds you guilty of espionage. For a crime of this magnitude there is only one penalty. 
DOCTOR: But this is ridiculous! You know all the evidence has been twisted against us! Tell them! 
SMYTHE: The witnesses have given their evidence. The court has reached it's verdict. If you've nothing further to say, sentence will be passed. 
DOCTOR: I most certainly have something further to say! This is all just a mockery! I demand the right to appeal to a higher authority. 
SMYTHE: There is no right of appeal. You will be executed at dawn tomorrow. Take him away, Sergeant Major! 
BURNS: Prisoners and escort, left turn! 
JAMIE: Now just a moment, you can't do this to us! 
BURNS: Hold him! 
JAMIE: Let go! 
SERGEANT MAJOR: Hand him over to the MPs. They'll take him to the military prison. 
(Jamie is taken away.) 
BURNS: I'll take these two back to the cell, sir. 
BUCKINGHAM: Just a minute, Sergeant Major. Captain Ransom, surely you're not going to keep this poor girl in the cells all night? 
RANSOM: Well, we've nowhere else to keep her. 
BUCKINGHAM: Well, why not leave her here? I could look after her. 
RANSOM: Yes, I don't see why not. 
BUCKINGHAM: Thank you. 
RANSOM: All right, put a guard on the door, Sergeant Major, and take him away. 
BURNS: Sir! 
ZOE: Oh I don't want to leave you, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Now you stay here, Zoe. Goodbye, my dear. 
(The Doctor kisses Zoe on the forehead and leaves with the Sergeant Major.) 
ZOE: Oh, can't you help us, Lieutenant Carstairs? 
CARSTAIRS: Nothing I can do, I'm afraid. 
BARRINGTON: Well, nice to have met you both. Must be getting back. Goodbye, my dear. Chin up. 
(Barrington leaves.) 
ZOE: But you can't let them execute the Doctor. He hasn't done anything. 
RANSOM: Well, you heard the evidence, my dear. It's all proved. I'm afraid he is a spy.

[Wine cellar]

BURNS [OC]: Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right. 
(The Doctor is marched in.) 
BURNS: I'll see that they bring you something to eat. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Sergeant Major? Have you been at the front long? 
BURNS: Oh, quite a while. I've been out here since 
DOCTOR: What's the matter? 
BURNS: Can't remember. Here, what are you asking me all these questions for?

[Smythe's room]

RANSOM: Sir? 
SMYTHE: Yes, what is it? 
RANSOM: You wanted the keys to the prison cell. 
SMYTHE: Oh yes. Is everything arranged for the execution? 
RANSOM: Yes. 
SMYTHE: Very well. 
(Ransom leaves. Smythe puts the keys under his pillow and lies down. A sentry checks on Zoe and Buckingham sleeping in chairs in the main room. Once he has gone, Zoe sneaks over to Smythe's room and goes inside. There is no one there. She discovers the monitor behind the portrait, then hunts for the keys, finds them and leaves.)

[Wine cellar]

(The Doctor hides behind the door when he hears it being unlocked.) 
DOCTOR: Zoe! 
ZOE: Oh Doctor! 
DOCTOR: How on Earth? 
ZOE: Well, I couldn't leave you to be shot, could I? It's dawn. 
DOCTOR: Oh, what a nice and clever girl you are. Now, we must find Jamie. They said something about a military prison. 
ZOE: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Come on. 
RANSOM: Quite right, Doctor. It is time to go.

[Farm yard]

(The firing squad is all ready and waiting. A soldier holds Zoe by the arm as the Doctor is lead to a stake in front of wall and fastened to it.) 
RANSOM: Squad, attention! Present! Aim! 
(A volley of gunfire.)

Episode Two

[Farm yard]

(Gunshot. The Doctor tenses up for the pain but it is a soldier who has been injured. There is a sniper in one of the barns nearby.) 
RANSOM: Divert! 
(The firing squad scatter to try and get the sniper. The soldier guarding Zoe is hit and she runs to free the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: Well done, Zoe. Can you undo it? 
ZOE: Oh, Doctor. 
(Zoe unties him.) 
ZOE: Come on!

[Smythe's room]

(Smythe is reporting to his controllers.) 
SMYTHE: I am leaving for the conference now. 
(Smythe turns off the monitor and closes the portrait over it. There is a Tardis-like sound as a large metal object appears in the corner of the room and an entrance slides forward from the centre. Ransom enters.) 
RANSOM: General Smythe, the prisoners have 
SMYTHE: Ransom, get out! 
RANSOM: Sir, what? 
(Smythe puts on his spectacles.) 
SMYTHE: There is nothing there. You can see nothing. 
RANSOM: No, sir, there's nothing there. 
SMYTHE: You have not seen me. I have been called away to an important meeting. 
RANSOM: Important meeting. Yes. 
(Smythe goes into the SIDRAT, for that is what it is, the door closes and it dematerialises.) 
RANSOM: General Smythe? Oh, of course, he's gone to that meeting.

[Tack room]

(Still not a proper cell, but with barbed wire wrapped around the bars in the door grille.) 
JAMIE: Hey, do I not get any breakfast? 
(Two guards throw another man in with Jamie. Dishevelled but still wearing his powdered wig...) 
JAMIE: Redcoat? What are you doing here? 
REDCOAT: Highlander! Keep away from me, you! 
JAMIE: Hey, easy now. I'm a prisoner too, you know! How'd you get here? Well, come on, how did you get here? 
REDCOAT: I don't know, I can't remember! I got lost, I think. 
JAMIE: What year do you think it is? 
REDCOAT: Year? Why, it's seventeen forty five. 
JAMIE: Sss?!

[Forest edge]

(The Doctor uses his telescope to spy out a set of heavily guarded farm buildings complete with machine gun emplacements.) 
DOCTOR: Oh yes. Yes. Yes, that's it. That's the military prison, all right. That's where Jamie'll be. Take a look. The trouble is those sentries. 
ZOE: What are we going to do? 
DOCTOR: Don't know. I shall have to think of something. Come on. 
(They run down a slope to a road where a staff car is driving along. The Doctor flags it down.) 
DOCTOR: Stop! And about time too! Where have you been? 
DRIVER: Eh? 
DOCTOR: You were sent to meet us! 
DRIVER: Meet who? 
DOCTOR: Now don't argue! Take us to the prison! In you get, Miss Heriot. Well, drive on!

[Tack room]

JAMIE: Look, you must try and remember! 
REDCOAT: I've told you. I was fighting up in the Highlands, I got lost and I don't. There was this mist. 
JAMIE: Uh huh. 
REDCOAT: It came down all round me. The next thing I knew, everything was different. 
JAMIE: Well, how do you mean, different? 
REDCOAT: Well, there were these great big guns, bigger than I'd ever seen before, and carts moving along without horses. 
JAMIE: Aye, I've seen those too. Now, go on, go on. 
REDCOAT: Well, then these fellows in the funny uniforms, they came along, and they caught me and brought me here. Where are we? 
JAMIE: I don't know. But I've got to get to the Doctor. Look, and you're going to help me. 
REDCOAT: Oh, no! I don't trust you. You're one of them rebels! 
JAMIE: Now look, just you listen to me a moment. 
(Jamie advances on the Redcoat with a wheel spoke in his hand.)

[Commandant's office]

(Farmhouse kitchen, actually. Another officer on another field telephone.) 
GORTON: Who? Civilians? Well, tell them to wait. I'm having my tea. 
(But barely has he taken a sip when -) 
DOCTOR: How dare you treat me like this, sir! 
GORTON: What? Who the blazes are you? 
DOCTOR: Don't you address me like that, sir! This is disgraceful! I shall make a complaint directly to the Minister himself! 
(That would be Lord Derby.) 
GORTON: Minister? Oh, I don't understand. Who are you? 
DOCTOR: I'm the examiner from the War Office, I'm here to inspect the military prison. This young lady is my secretary. Well, you were expecting us, surely? 
GORTON: Well, there must be some mistake. I mean, can I see your identification papers? 
DOCTOR: How dare you! You send no car to meet us on our arrival, and now you add insult to injury by doubting my credentials! Do you know who I am, sir? 
GORTON: Well, I'm terribly sorry and all that. It's probably my adjutant's fault. Would you care for some tea? 
DOCTOR: We are here to inspect the security arrangements of the prison. Now I suggest we stop wasting time and get on with it!

[British command post]

RANSOM: Not a trace of them. General Smythe'll be furious. We must get those people back. 
CARSTAIRS: Yes, of course, sir. 
RANSOM: Now, you're got to help me, both of you. Get a party from my sergeant and search this building. 
CARSTAIRS: Yes, sir. 
RANSOM: I'll take a patrol towards the German lines. 
BUCKINGHAM: What shall I do? 
RANSOM: I'd like you to stay here and man the telephone. I've put out an alert and someone might phone in some information. All right, Carstairs? 
CARSTAIRS: Yes, sir! 
RANSOM: Lady Jennifer, if the General returns perhaps you'd explain what has happened? 
BUCKINGHAM: Certainly. Where's he gone? 
RANSOM: He's been called away to an urgent meeting. 
(Ransom leaves.) 
BUCKINGHAM: I know it's an awful thing to say but I can't help hoping they get away. 
CARSTAIRS: I know just how you feel. Still 
RANSOM [OC]: Carstairs! 
CARSTAIRS: Excuse me.

[Tack room]

(The Redcoat has Jamie on the floor, struggling.) 
JAMIE: Help me, guard! He's trying to 
REDCOAT: You're right, I'll kill you! 
JAMIE: He's trying to kill me! Stop it! 
(Two guards rush in and haul the Redcoat off Jamie.) 
GUARD: Get off him! 
JAMIE: Now! 
(Jamie rams the wheel spoke into the sergeant's belly then punches his lights out while the Redcoat first knees then hits the other.) 
JAMIE: You fight very well, for a redcoat.

[British command post]

BUCKINGHAM: All right, Corporal. I'll tell the Captain. 
(Carstairs enters.) 
BUCKINGHAM: Any luck? 
CARSTAIRS: Not a sign. 
BUCKINGHAM: That was one of the patrol posts. Nothing to report. 
CARSTAIRS: Poor old Ransom. He's in for a sticky time when the General gets back. 
BUCKINGHAM: Didn't you think that there was something rather strange about that court martial? 
CARSTAIRS: Oh well, military justice, you know. It's not like the Old Bailey. 
BUCKINGHAM: No, but, you remember we were talking about not remembering things? 
CARSTAIRS: Yes? 
BUCKINGHAM: Well, things are starting to come back to me. 
CARSTAIRS: What sort of things? 
BUCKINGHAM: Well, I was on my way to the hospital, well behind the lines. I was driving through a forest and all of a sudden there was a strange sort of mist. Fog. And then I was in a field dressing station looking after some wounded soldiers. 
CARSTAIRS: Hmm. Loss of memory. 
BUCKINGHAM: No, but isn't it strange that you should to be suffering from it too? 
CARSTAIRS: Mist! 
BUCKINGHAM: What about it? 
CARSTAIRS: I wonder, could it be some kind of new gas? If perhaps the Germans have invented a new type of poison gas, one that affects our minds.

[Commandant's office]

GORTON: And finally, on the outer perimeter there are the concealed tripwires and the patrols. 
DOCTOR: Ah. 
ZOE: Certainly does look escape proof. 
DOCTOR: I'd like to see your records. 
GORTON: What? Oh yes, they're over here. You won't find anything wrong there. 
(Gorton hands over a huge ledger.) 
DOCTOR: I sincerely hope not. 
GORTON: There you are. 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. 
GORTON: Arrivals. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
GORTON: Lengths of sentences. Discharges. 
DOCTOR: Yes, arrivals. Latest arrival, Scottish deserter awaiting return to his regiment. Possible to talk to a prisoner? 
GORTON: Well, er, it's very irregular. However, for you I'm sure that I can arrange (The telephone rings.) 
GORTON: Excuse me. Gorton here. What? Escaped! Well, get onto it right away, man. Let me know as soon as you've got them. 
DOCTOR: Is something the matter, Commandant? 
GORTON: Er, nothing important. 
DOCTOR: Did I hear you say that someone had escaped? 
GORTON: Oh well, as a matter of fact, yes. Two chaps. One of them was the Scotsman that you were talking about.

[Prison]

(Jamie and the Redcoat skirt along a wall, but when they have to step out into the open they are spotted.) 
GUARD: Halt or we fire! 
JAMIE: Come on! 
(The guards fire their revolvers.)

[Commandant's office]

GORTON: Shot? Both of them? I see, right. Keep me informed. That's one of them. Shot while trying to escape. 
ZOE: Shot? Well, which one was it? The Highlander? 
GORTON: No, but does it matter? 
DOCTOR: Matter? Why, of course it matters! Shooting down prisoners? Why, it's barbaric! 
GORTON: But they were trying to escape! 
DOCTOR: Well, that's no excuse for murder! I want the other man brought here. 
GORTON: What for? 
DOCTOR: I'm not satisfied. I want to hear the prisoner's side of the story. 
(Jamie is dragged along by two guards, his feet not touching the ground, and pushed into the kitchen.) 
JAMIE: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: We'll see you get a doctor if you need one, my man. Right, let him go. Commandant, dismiss your man. 
GORTON: Carry on. 
(The MP leaves.) 
JAMIE: What are you doing? 
DOCTOR: Speak when you're spoken to! Now then, what's all this about trying to escape? 
JAMIE: What are you up to? 
DOCTOR: I'm not concerned with that! What about the other man you escaped with? 
JAMIE: Oh, he was shot in the leg, and they were going to shoot me, too. 
DOCTOR: I see. This is very serious. I shall have to make a full report. 
GORTON: But they were trying to escape! My men had no alternative but to shoot. 
DOCTOR: We'll see what General Smythe has to say about that 
. GORTON: Indeed we will! 
DOCTOR: What are you doing? 
GORTON: I'm going to telephone General Smythe. I've had about all I can take from you, sir. General Smythe. 
DOCTOR: Ah, you'll regret this. The Minister 
GORTON: I don't care two hoots about the Minister. Besides, I'm not even sure you're from the War Office. Yes, where are your identity papers? 
DOCTOR: My identity papers? 
GORTON: I thought so. I thought there was a fishy story all along. Hello, is that 
(Zoe smashes a vase of flowers down onto Gorton's head.) 
ZOE: I'm sorry, Doctor, but it seemed the only way. 
DOCTOR: Oh, well done, Zoe. Yes, I think he'll survive. Right, come on. Let's see if we can bluff our way out of here. 
JAMIE: Yeah, but why were you kidding 
(Ransom enters with two MPs.) 
RANSOM: Going somewhere? Perhaps I can give you a lift?

[British command post]

BUCKINGHAM: General Smythe had made up his mind those people were guilty. He wanted that man to be shot! 
CARSTAIRS: Perhaps he knew they were guilty? 
BUCKINGHAM: Oh, you don't really believe that? 
CARSTAIRS: No, I don't, but 
(Ransom enters.) 
RANSOM: Well, we've got them. You'll never believe where we found them. 
CARSTAIRS: Where were they? 
RANSOM: Well, I was on my way back here, I'd given up the search. It suddenly occurred to me I ought to go and tell Gorton about it. 
BUCKINGHAM: Well, who's Gorton? 
RANSOM: He's the Commandant at the prison. Popped into his office and there they were. 
CARSTAIRS: What were they doing there? 
RANSOM: Do you know, that chap, he'd convinced old Gorton that he was a minister from Whitehall. And he'd nearly bluffed him into letting that Scots lad go. I don't know I must say I admire his gall. It seems a pity, really, to have to shoot him. 
CARSTAIRS: Sir, I'd like to speak to you, sir. The court martial wasn't in accordance with King's Regulations. 
RANSOM: What? 
CARSTAIRS: I'm not satisfied. 
RANSOM: Oh don't be ridiculous, man, it's perfectly fair. General's a great stickler for that kind of thing. Sentence will be carried out as soon as he returns. Lady Jennifer, notify Command Post, will you? Let them know the hunt's over. 
BUCKINGHAM: Yes, certainly. 
(Ransom leaves.) 
BUCKINGHAM: Do you see? He didn't remember what happened at the court martial. 
CARSTAIRS: He really seems to believe they had a fair trial! 
BUCKINGHAM: The General wanted that man to be shot. Why? 
CARSTAIRS: I don't know. I think I'd better have a word with those civilians and try and find out. If Ransom comes back, keep him occupied, will you? 
BUCKINGHAM: Right.

[Wine cellar]

DOCTOR: A redcoat, Jamie? 
JAMIE: Aye, and he thinks he's in 1745. 
DOCTOR: But that's a complete anachronism. 
JAMIE: Aye. It's a what? 
DOCTOR: It's something out of it's own time. 
ZOE: Yes, like the telecommunications unit in the General's room that I told you about. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
ZOE: I found it when I was looking for the key. 
DOCTOR: Both these things are in the wrong time. But what are they doing here in 1917? 
JAMIE: Shush. 
(Carstairs enters, revolver drawn.) 
CARSTAIRS: Close the door.

[British command post]

BUCKINGHAM: Yes Major, they were recaptured half an hour ago. Captain Ransom wanted me to let you know. Goodbye. I've notified all the command posts. 
RANSOM: That's awfully kind of you. Has the General not returned yet? 
BUCKINGHAM: No. Does he often disappear like this? I mean, surely he ought to keep you informed? 
RANSOM: Well, he's a very busy man, you know. Where's young Carstairs? 
BUCKINGHAM: Oh, he's gone to look for some transport. 
RANSOM: Oh, good. I think I'd better go and make certain those prisoners are safely under lock and key. 
BUCKINGHAM: It must be very difficult working for someone like General Smythe. 
RANSOM: Yes, I suppose he is a bit of a martinet. He has a great deal of responsibility, you know. 
BUCKINGHAM: Oh yes, but a great deal falls upon your shoulders, Captain. 
RANSOM: Yes, I suppose it is a job, running a place like this you know. Quite a problem. People don't understand. It's the paperwork, you see. It's quite fantastic how many forms we have to fill in. Just look at that.

[Wine cellar]

CARSTAIRS: What is a video screen? Some kind of kinematograph? 
ZOE: Oh, well, it's a bit more complicated than that. If only I could show it to you. 
DOCTOR: If you'll take us to the General's room, we'll prove this thing exists! 
CARSTAIRS: All right, you show it to me and I'll believe you. But you'd better be right.

[British command post]

BUCKINGHAM: I see! But how do you keep a track of all the equipment? 
RANSOM: Ah well, now that's the problem. I keep sending these subalterns the forms, and they just don't fill them in. 
BUCKINGHAM: But if they're at the front, fighting? 
RANSOM: There's no excuse for mislaying valuable military equipment. Do you know, in the last push we lost over one hundred shovels? 
(The telephone rings. Buckingham gets to it first.)

[Outside the wine cellar]

CARSTAIRS: Hello, Lady Jennifer? Carstairs. Look, I. What, there with you now? Well, get rid of him, quickly!

[British command post]

BUCKINGHAM: Yes, all right. I will. 
RANSOM: That for me? 
BUCKINGHAM: Yes, all right. 
RANSOM: Who was there? 
BUCKINGHAM: The General. 
RANSOM: The General? 
BUCKINGHAM: He's at number seventeen command post and he'd like you to join him there immediately. 
RANSOM: Oh, right. Well, what's he doing there? That's the farthest point of the sector! I'd better join him, I suppose. Jolly nice talking to you. You know, not many women take an interest in the problems of supply. Goodbye. 
(Ransom leaves. The telephone rings.) 
BUCKINGHAM: Yes? Yes, he's just gone. Oh. All right. 
(Buckingham goes to the window to watch a car drive away. Carstairs enters with the Doctor, Zoe and Jamie.) 
BUCKINGHAM: What on earth are you doing? 
DOCTOR: There's no time to explain now. Now, where is this thing, Zoe? 
ZOE: It's over there. 
BUCKINGHAM: But that's the General's private room!

[Smythe's room]

(Revolver still drawn, Carstairs leads the group in. Zoe opens the portrait door to reveal the monitor.) 
ZOE: There it is! 
CARSTAIRS: There's nothing there, only wall. 
DOCTOR: What? You mean you can't see that screen? 
BUCKINGHAM: What are we supposed to be looking at? 
CARSTAIRS: Well, I still can't see anything. 
DOCTOR: Look at the wall! Concentrate! 
(Carstairs and Buckingham stare at the wood panelling until the dial and monitor appear.) 
BUCKINGHAM: It is there. I can see it! 
DOCTOR: Can you see it yet? 
CARSTAIRS: Yes. But what's it for? 
ZOE: Well, it's like a telephone, only you can see people as well as hear them. 
BUCKINGHAM: What's on the other end?

[War room]

DOCTOR [on monitor]: Good heavens, this thing is switched on! 
(The Doctor turns it off, leaving Smythe and a man in a dark visor staring at a glass map.)

[Smythe's room]

ZOE: But we didn't see anything on the screen. 
DOCTOR: No, but somebody may have seen us. We've got to get away from here, all of us. 
CARSTAIRS: Get away? Where do you hope to get to? 
DOCTOR: Well, anywhere so long as it's away from here. 
CARSTAIRS: I just can't let you go, just like that. 
DOCTOR: Yes, you can. And you've got to come too. Your lives will be in danger now, both of you. 
BUCKINGHAM: I think he's right. 
DOCTOR: Now look, my friends and I are leaving here. Are you going to shoot us down? 
CARSTAIRS: All right. I'll believe you.

[British command post]

BUCKINGHAM: I'll get the ambulance. 
CARSTAIRS: Yes. I'll meet you by the front entrance. 
DOCTOR: So what do you want us to do? 
CARSTAIRS: Just clamber into the ambulance and keep quiet. I'm going to have to bluff our way past the sentries. Now, just wait here. I'll get some maps. 
(Carstairs leaves.) 
JAMIE: Are we going back to the Tardis now? 
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, we must stay here and see what is happening. 
ZOE: We can't leave these people now, anyway. 
JAMIE: No, I suppose not. 
CARSTAIRS: Right, are you ready? Come on. 
RANSOM: Carstairs, what's going on? 
CARSTAIRS: Orders from the General, sir. He wants the prisoners taken to HQ immediately. 
RANSOM: Are you sure your message is genuine? 
CARSTAIRS: Well, yes, sir, I spoke to the General personally. 
RANSOM: Well, I don't know. I had a message to meet him at command post seventeen. That was a fake. 
CARSTAIRS: Well, the General was most insistent, sir, but of course it is up to you, sir. 
RANSOM: Oh, you'd better carry on. 
CARSTAIRS: Very good, sir. All right, move off. Any trouble mind, I won't hesitate to fire. 
RANSOM: Just a minute, Carstairs. 
CARSTAIRS: Sir? 
RANSOM: Where's Lady Jennifer? 
CARSTAIRS: She's somewhere around, sir. 
RANSOM: Right. 
(Carstairs and the travellers leave.) 
RANSOM: I want a word with her.

[Farm gate]

(The ambulance stops.) 
DOCTOR: Right, Zoe, up you go. 
JAMIE: Okay, right.

[British command post]

(The SIDRAT has materialised in Smythe's room and the General has closed the portrait door properly.) 
SMYTHE: Where are the prisoners? 
RANSOM: Everything's all right, sir. They're on their way to headquarters just as you ordered. 
SMYTHE: I gave no such order! 
RANSOM: Well, they've just left with Lieutenant Carstairs, sir. 
SMYTHE: Ransom, you're a fool! Where's Lady Jennifer? 
RANSOM: I don't know, sir. She gave me a message to meet you at command post seventeen. (looks out of the window) The ambulance, sir, it's gone. 
SMYTHE: Now we know what to look for. Well, issue a general order at once! 
RANSOM: Yes, sir. 
(Whilst the ambulance trundles along a road.) 
RANSOM: Good, thank you. Ambulance spotted, sir. 
SMYTHE: Where? 
RANSOM: Sector four, heading east, travelling very fast. I'll send out a motorcycle patrol. 
SMYTHE: No need for that. 
RANSOM: Well, sector four could cut them off. 
SMYTHE: Concentration of artillery there. Yes, that should reach them. 
RANSOM: We'll use artillery on an ambulance, sir? 
SMYTHE: That ambulance is in enemy hands, Ransom. 
RANSOM: But there are two women on board. 
(Smythe puts his spectacles on.) 
SMYTHE: I want a creeping barrage laid along that road. Do you understand? Do you understand? 
RANSOM: Yes, I understand. 
SMYTHE: Good. Well, order the artillery to fire, then. 
RANSOM: A very good idea, sir. Creeping barrage. Stop them dead. 
SMYTHE: That's just how we want them. Dead.

[Ambulance]

(The shell explosions make the ambulance stop. Carstairs joins the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe in the back.) 
CARSTAIRS: Maps! Artillery barrage, and we're still seven miles from the German line. 
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps it's not, perhaps it's not German artillery. 
CARSTAIRS: Well, our chaps wouldn't fire at us. 
DOCTOR: No, but General Smythe might! 
JAMIE: Whoever it is, his aim's getting better! 
CARSTAIRS: Let's get out of here! Bring the rest of the maps. 
DOCTOR: Righto! Stay here, keep under cover.

[Road]

(The Doctor sits with Buckingham and Carstairs up front.) 
CARSTAIRS: Right! 
(The ambulance drives forward and fades to nothing.)

[Mist]

BUCKINGHAM: Oh! 
DOCTOR: What is it? 
CARSTAIRS: Fog. Can't see. 
BUCKINGHAM: The mist, the gas! 
DOCTOR: Gas? 
BUCKINGHAM: I can't go on, there's something stopping me. 
DOCTOR: It's not gas, go on. 
BUCKINGHAM: I can't! 
DOCTOR: Well, move over. Let me, come on. 
(The Doctor gets behind the steering wheel and releases the handbrake.)

[Road]

(The ambulance appears on a peaceful road winding besides a river - actually Seven Sisters Country Park, Sussex. They get out and look around.) 
JAMIE: That's more like it. 
ZOE: That mist, Doctor, what was it? 
DOCTOR: I don't know, Zoe. Some sort of force field. 
ZOE: Where are we? There's no sign of the war here. 
JAMIE: Yes, and the guns have stopped, too. 
DOCTOR: Yes. It's odd, Jamie. 
CARSTAIRS: Feeling better? 
BUCKINGHAM: Yes. Thank you.

[Hilltop]

(Above the road and river. There's a vague sound of men shouting in the distance.) 
JAMIE: Ah, that's better! 
ZOE: What's that? 
(A phalanx of warriors are heading towards them lead by a two horse chariot. Romans!) 
ZOE: Oh, come on!

[Road]

(As the Romans plant their SPQR at the top of the rise.) 
DOCTOR: Start the engine! 
ZOE: Quick! 
JAMIE: Look! 
CARSTAIRS: Switch on. 
(Carstairs starts cranking as the Romans bear down on them.)

Episode Three

[Road]

(The ambulance engine catches and Carstairs gets in as Buckingham slowly backs the ambulance up the road and it fades away. When the Romans get there they just stop in mid yell.)

[Ambulance]

ZOE: That was a close shave. Where are we, Doctor? 
JAMIE: Oh no, we're not back here again. 
(Carstairs and Buckingham join them in the back.) 
DOCTOR: Ah, Lieutenant Carstairs, is this the only map you're supplied with? 
CARSTAIRS: Yes, that's the one. 
DOCTOR: It's a bit inadequate, isn't it? 
BUCKINGHAM: Doctor, who were those people who attacked us just now? 
DOCTOR: Oh, they were Romans. 
CARSTAIRS: Oh, but that's impossible! 
DOCTOR: Oh, lots of impossible things happen when you pass through time. 
BUCKINGHAM: Time? But no one can alter time. 
DOCTOR: Look, it is 1917 where we are now on this map. Where we were attacked by the Romans it is two thousand years ago. 
CARSTAIRS: But surely, Doctor 
DOCTOR: Surely before we met the Romans we passed through a mist didn't we? A gas you called it. Now, supposing this mist is a barrier between different time zones? 
ZOE: I see. So we went off the edge of this map and into a different time zone. 
DOCTOR: Yes. What we need is a map which covers all the time zones. I'm afraid we shall have to get back to General Smythe's headquarters, to the chateau. 
JAMIE: Well how are we going to get back there? 
DOCTOR: Well, that's easy. You will take us!

[British command post]

RANSOM: No trace of them? Well, keep searching! 
(Jamie and the Doctor enter, followed by Carstairs.) 
CARSTAIRS: Lieutenant Carstairs reporting, sir. I brought back the prisoners. 
RANSOM: Carstairs, what on earth have you been up to? And what do you mean by giving me that fake report from the General? I warn you, Carstairs, you're in very serious trouble! You're 
(Carstairs points his revolver directly at Ransom.) 
RANSOM: Have you gone mad? 
CARSTAIRS: I'm sorry about this, sir. 
RANSOM: You'll be shot for this, Carstairs! 
CARSTAIRS: Yes, sir. 
(Jamie takes Ransom's gun.) 
CARSTAIRS: Don't do anything foolish, sir. I think it might be better if you raised your hands. 
(The Doctor rummages around for maps.) 
CARSTAIRS: Bandages, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: What? Oh, yes. I'm afraid that there's nothing here, only local maps. Here we are. Perhaps there's something in the General's room. I'll go and see. 
RANSOM: This is mutiny. I hope you 
(Jamie stuffs a handkerchief into Ransom's mouth and fastens it there with a bandage.)

[Smythe's room]

(The Doctor enters and looks around.) 
CARSTAIRS: Find anything? 
DOCTOR: Well, only this safe. 
CARSTAIRS: The only way to get inside that is to blow it up. 
DOCTOR: Oh, what a good idea. 
CARSTAIRS: You serious? 
DOCTOR: Well, this is a military establishment, there must be some explosives around here. 
CARSTAIRS: Right. I'll see what I can find. 
DOCTOR: Good. 
(Carstairs leaves.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie, I wonder whether perhaps I can pick this lock. 
JAMIE: Aye, with a tuning fork? 
(While Ransom is trussed up on the settee, Carstairs opens boxes and crates in the drawing room.) 
JAMIE: Oh come on, Doctor, we haven't got all night. Someone's bound to turn up. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I know, Jamie. Oh dear, this is useless. 
(Carstairs enters with a hand-sized device.) 
JAMIE: What's that thing? 
CARSTAIRS: It's a Mills bomb. It's all I could find. I thought we might hang it on the front of the safe and let it off. 
DOCTOR: Oh, well, yes, that might blow the room up very nicely, but I don't think it would affect the safe much. You see we have to concentrate the 
(The Doctor is fiddling with the primitive grenade.) 
CARSTAIRS: Look out! 
DOCTOR: Whole explosion into the lock there. 
CARSTAIRS: Blow us all up. 
DOCTOR: Now then, if I can pack the explosive into the lock and then detonate it. Ah, here we are. Now then. Ah yes, I see. 
CARSTAIRS: For goodness sake, be careful. That's Amatol in there. 
DOCTOR: It's all right. I do have the detonator, you know. Now then, just release this. There we are. Now what have we got? Oh yes. 
(The Doctor pours the explosive powder onto a piece of paper.) 
DOCTOR: This fuse, how long does it last? 
CARSTAIRS: About four seconds. 
DOCTOR: Oh, that's not very good, is it? 
(The Doctor looks for a longer fuse, briefly considering on of the tassels on Jamie's best sporran. He settles for breaking a candle and using its wick. He inserts it carefully into the safe lock.) 
DOCTOR: There we are. 
RANSOM [OC]: Help! Help!

[British command post]

(Ransom has tipped over the settee and dislodged his gag, obviously.) 
RANSOM: Sergeant Major! Help! 
CARSTAIRS: I'm sorry about this, sir. Can't have you making a row. 
CRANE: Hello. 
CARSTAIRS: Dropped my pen. 
CRANE: Ah. Captain Ransom about? 
CARSTAIRS: No, I'm looking after things. Can I help? 
CRANE: Well, it's a bit tricky, actually. The sentry found these two ladies hiding in an ambulance. 
CARSTAIRS: Well? What about it? 
CRANE: Well, you remember there was this spy flap earlier today. Something about them getting away in an ambulance and one of them was a woman. I don't think we've met before, have we?

[Smythe's room]

(Jamie strikes a match and they hide behind Smythe's camp bed. The Doctor covers his head with a pillow.) 
DOCTOR: Now we light the blue touch paper and retire immediately!

[British command post]

BUCKINGHAM: This is all completely ridiculous! 
CARSTAIRS: Really, old chap, you can leave them to me. I'm sure we can sort it out. 
CRANE: But don't you think I ought to wait for Captain Ransom? 
CARSTAIRS: He may be quite some time. 
CRANE: I can wait. How long do you say you've been on attachment here?

[Smythe's room]

CRANE [OC]: How long? 
CARSTAIRS [OC]: About three months. 
JAMIE: Someone's out there with Carstairs. 
(They go to listen at the door.)

[British command post]

CARSTAIRS: You may leave them to me, old chap. It's quite under control. 
CRANE: Oh well, right you are. Sorry about all this. Do hope you understand. Can't afford to take chances, you see. 
ZOE: We quite understand.

[Smythe's room]

CRANE [OC]: Perhaps you could stay for dinner. We don't often see ladies here. The chaps in the mess would be delighted. 
BUCKINGHAM [OC]: Sorry, but we really have to be on our way. 
DOCTOR: We shall have to put the fuse out. It's too late! Duck!

[British command post]

CRANE: Cheerio! 
(Crane leaves. The safe goes Boom and he rushes back in again.) 
CRANE: What the blazes?

[Smythe's room]

(Crane runs in. The Doctor and Jamie are coughing. Crane turns then raises his arms.) 
CARSTAIRS: Now don't do anything foolish, old boy. Doc, have you got any more bandages? 
DOCTOR: Ah yes. Here we are, Jamie. 
CRANE: You're Carstairs, the one who went off with the spies! 
CARSTAIRS: Come on! 
(Jamie takes Crane out to be tied up. The Doctor has found a map marked off in triangles. Zoe enters.) 
DOCTOR: Look, Zoe. 1917 zone, Roman zone, American Civil War zone. This whole place is divided into time zones. 
ZOE: But there's a blank space in the middle. There's nothing marked at all. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, and I think that that's where we've got to get to. 
(And not the Crimean, 30 Years, Russo-Japanese, Greek, Boer, Peninsular, English Civil or Mexican Civil war zones.)

[Road]

(The ambulance is stopped by a German patrol.) 
DOCTOR: This is an ambulance. We have a seriously wounded officer in the back. 
(A German goes round to see Carstairs having his brow mopped by Zoe, with Buckingham attending.) 
GERMAN: Sie müssen mit uns kommen. 
DOCTOR: Ah. You want me to come with you. Ah well, if you put it like that. Yes, here we go.

[German trench]

ZOE: Well, what's going to happen to us? 
JAMIE: Ah, foreigners! Look, what's the use of pretending that Carstairs is wounded? They're bound to find out sooner or later. 
ZOE: Well, at least it stopped them taking him to a prison camp. Besides, he's safe in the ambulance with Jennifer. 
JAMIE: Aye, for how long though? 
ZOE: Well, perhaps the Doctor will be able to talk them into letting us go. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
[German field office]

LÜCKE: For the last time, what is your name? 
DOCTOR: Why don't you just call me Doctor? 
LÜCKE: That is not a name. I want your full name. 
DOCTOR: Oh, very well. Doctor John Smith. 
LÜCKE: Good. Now we are getting somewhere. What are you doing behind our lines? 
DOCTOR: Well, we were lost, you see. 
LÜCKE: So, you are lost. And very conveniently you find your way through our lines. 
DOCTOR: I realise this must seem rather strange. 
LÜCKE: I find it both strange and suspicious. 
DOCTOR: But I can assure you we're quite harmless. 
LÜCKE: Three people dressed in civilian clothes trying to infiltrate through our lines. Admit it, you are spies. 
DOCTOR: No, no, no, we are not spies. 
LÜCKE: Then tell me where you came from before you were picked up by that ambulance. 
DOCTOR: Well, you see, that's rather difficult to explain. 
LÜCKE: Everything seems to be difficult for you to explain. I advise you to tell me the truth. Now! 
(Lucke cocks his revolver.) 
DOCTOR: All right, if you insist.

[German trench]

(A soldier gives them two Prussian helmets.) 
JAMIE: Oh! I don't know how they stick it out here. 
ZOE: It's the same with the British, remember. 
JAMIE: What a way to fight, though, hiding in wee holes and blasting each other with big guns. 
(Boom!) 
ZOE: Oh, I wish we could get out of here, Jamie!

[German field office]

LÜCKE: Other planets? A time machine? The girl is from the future and the boy is from the past? 
DOCTOR: Well, you told me to tell you the truth. 
LÜCKE: I think you must be mad. 
DOCTOR: Why don't you ask my companions if you don't believe me? 
LÜCKE: Bringen Sie die anderen Engländer herein! Sofort! We shall soon see if your stories are the same. 
(Jamie and Zoe enter.) 
LÜCKE: Young woman, where did you meet this man? 
DOCTOR: Tell him the truth, both of you. 
LÜCKE: Silence! Well? 
ZOE: We met at a space station. 
LÜCKE: A space station. And you, where did you meet this man? 
JAMIE: In Scotland. 
LÜCKE: Ach, so. Now tell me, when? 
JAMIE: In seventeen forty five. I was fighting the Redcoats. 
LÜCKE: You were fighting the Redcoats in seventeen forty five? That ambulance, was it going to a hospital or to a lunatic asylum? 
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. Look, look, I can prove to you that we come from another time. This is a sonic screwdriver. Now, where can I demonstrate? Ah, that revolver will do. It's all right. 
(Lucke places his weapon on the table and the Doctor unscrews the hand grip without touching it.) 
DOCTOR: There we are. And back it goes. 
LÜCKE: Phantastisch! 
DOCTOR: Do you believe me now? 
LÜCKE: But it's impossible. You did not touch the screw. It just moved. Is it possible you are telling the truth? 
(A bald archetype Prussian enters, complete with duelling scar. All he needs is a monocle.) 
VON WEICH: Leutnant Lücke! 
LÜCKE: Jawohl, mein herr! 
VON WEICH: Wer sind diese Leute? 
LÜCKE: Wir haben hier 
VON WEICH: Was ist hier los? 
LÜCKE: Wir haben hier drei Englische zivilisten, herr Kapitän. 
VON WEICH: What are you doing here? Where do you come from? 
DOCTOR: Well 
LÜCKE: Er hat mir gesagt, dass er aus einem anderen Zeitalter kam, in annen rontschiff namen Tardis. 
VON WEICH: Time travellers? 
DOCTOR: Well, it is a little difficult to understand, but 
VON WEICH: Leutnant Lücke! Kommen sie bitte mit mir. 
LUCKE: Jawohl, mein Kapitan.

[Von Weich's room]

(Von Weich leads Lücke though a curtain and screws in his monocle.) 
VON WEICH: Es sind Englische spione! Wir müssen sie festhalten! Ich werde mit dem General darüber sprechen. 
LÜCKE: Jawohl herr Kapitän Von Weich. 
(Lücke walks slowly back through the curtain.)

[German field office]

LÜCKE: You are dangerous English spies. 
DOCTOR: But this is ridiculous. 
LÜCKE: You are spies! And you are going to be shot.

[Von Weich's room]

(Behind a portrait hanging on a panelled wall is another monitor screen, just like Smythes'.) 
VON WEICH: Von Weich, 1917 German front line to central control. We have captured three people who escaped from the British sector. They claim to be time travellers.

[German field office]

DOCTOR: No, no, no! We are not spies! The sonic screwdriver. We've just shown you with the gun. 
LÜCKE: Yes. You did something with thee gun. 
JAMIE: Let the Doctor show you again, eh? 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. Now, it's very simple. Put the gun on the table. You can keep your hand on it again if you like! Now, watch. 
(The screw in the grip goes up and down.) 
LÜCKE: Yes! And then you put it back again! 
DOCTOR: That's right. 
LÜCKE: Is it possible? 
DOCTOR: Oh, we've got lots of tricks like that. Let me show you. Catch, Jamie. 
(Jamie catches the gun and points it at Lucke.) 
DOCTOR: Now then, Lieutenant. I'm sorry about this, but perhaps you'd be good enough to take us back to our ambulance!

[War room]

(Large and alien, staffed by people wearing visors and overalls. An alarm sounds. Smythe is also there. Four guards in wet suits with laser rifles or similar enter, followed by a man with a square medallion around his neck. Smythe gestures the other staff to leave.) 
SMYTHE: Did you have a comfortable trip, sir? 
WAR CHIEF: Excellent. The War Lord is pleased with our work. But the rate of progress must be accelerated. 
SMYTHE: A report from my zone, sir. The prisoners that escaped from the chateau been recaptured in the German lines. I have advised they be shot immediately. They gave some ridiculous story about being time travellers. 
WAR CHIEF: Time travellers? And you ordered them to be shot? I want them brought here for re-interrogation. 
(The alarm sounds again.) 
VON WEICH [on monitor]: Those prisoners, they've escaped. They will probably go back to your lines. 
SMYTHE: How did that happen? 
VON WEICH [on monitor]: They tricked my human Lieutenant. 
SMYTHE: Oh that is sheer incompetence! 
WAR CHIEF: They also escaped from you, General Smythe. Organise pursuit and report back here. 
VON WEICH [on monitor]: Sir. 
(Transmission ends.) 
WAR CHIEF: Issue a general alert. But I want these people captured alive. 
SMYTHE: General alert to all time zones. Five escaped prisoners travelling in a 1917 British Army ambulance clearly marked with a red cross. These prisoners may be capable of crossing the time zone barriers. Officers are to describe the ambulance to their human troops as a hostile vehicle which much be destroyed at all costs! 
WAR CHIEF [OC]: Time travellers? I wonder. 
SMYTHE: The description of the prisoners is as follows.

[Ambulance]

(Under the gaze of an American soldier, the ambulance stops and Carstairs goes to the back.) 
CARSTAIRS: Can I have a look at that map, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes. Here we are. 
CARSTAIRS: We've just been through another one of those mists and we've gone off the edge of my map. 
ZOE: Where do you think we are, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I think we're right about there. 
ZOE: America 1862. That was the American Civil War wasn't it? Another war! 
(Gun shots.) 
CARSTAIRS: Get down!

[Road]

(The soldier fires, and Carstairs shoots back.) 
CARSTAIRS: Get moving!

[Ambulance]

(The Doctor pokes his head out.) 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, be careful! 
DOCTOR: Zoe, we're right. That was an American Civil War soldier. 
JAMIE: You mean we're mixed up in another war now? 
DOCTOR: Yes. But it means we're on the right road, and we're still making for that blank space in the middle of the map.

[Road]

(Further on, a tree falls in front of the ambulance.) 
CARSTAIRS: Jamie! 
(Jamie, the Doctor and Zoe get out of the ambulance. They are about to move the tree when shots are fired. Carstairs is the only one who actually hits his targets though. The survivors run away.) 
CARSTAIRS: Get that tree moved! 
DOCTOR: Come on. 
(Carstairs takes out another man creeping up behind the ambulance, and tackles a fourth hand to hand. Jamie deals with another as the Doctor and Zoe drag the tree off the road.) 
DOCTOR: Where have you been? We've done it without you. 
(Carstairs hold off some horsemen as the three get back into the ambulance. Then he has to change pistols as more cavalry arrive.) 
CARSTAIRS: Lady Jennifer! Drive on! 
(Further on, Buckingham pulls the ambulance over in some bushes and cavalry ride past. She opens the engine cover.) 
DOCTOR: What's wrong? 
BUCKINGHAM: Afraid we've run out of petrol. 
DOCTOR: Oh no! 
BUCKINGHAM: Where's Lieutenant Carstairs? 
JAMIE: He held them off while we got away. 
BUCKINGHAM: Oh, dear. 
ZOE: Oh, well now what do we do? 
DOCTOR: There's only one thing for it. We shall have to go on by foot. Come along.

[War room]

SMYTHE: If my troops make a push here, what resistance can you put up? 
VON WEICH: Along here we shall have pillboxes, machine gun nests, landmines. You'll have no chance, but it will be an excellent test of the morale of your humans. Your entire force will be wiped out. 
SMYTHE: Ah, but I will use my reinforcements to turn your flank. There! 
VON WEICH: Then it will not be a fair battle. 
SMYTHE: Perhaps not, but it will be an excellent test of your morale. 
WAR CHIEF: Those specimens we were discussing. An ambush was laid but only one was captured. 
SMYTHE: Which one? 
WAR CHIEF: A young Lieutenant, one of yours. He could have got away, but he stayed behind to help the others escape. 
VON WEICH: These humans are very loyal to one another in stress situations. 
WAR CHIEF: One of their finest qualities. He's being brought back here for re-processing.

[Barn]

(Crickets are singing. It must be evening.) 
JAMIE: It's all right. This'll do for the night, eh? 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, Jamie, this looks all right. 
ZOE: I wish we knew where Lieutenant Carstairs was. 
JAMIE: We shouldn't have left him, you know. 
DOCTOR: It was the way he wanted it. 
ZOE: Well, now what do we do? We've lost Lieutenant Carstairs, the ambulance has broken down and we're miles from the Tardis. 
DOCTOR: We carry on, of course. We've got no alternative. 
JAMIE: Are we still heading for that blank space in that map of yours? 
DOCTOR: Yes. That is where we'll find the answer. Now we'd better get some rest. We'll have to start early in the morning. 
(A materialisation sound fills the barn.) 
DOCTOR: Quick, hide! 
(A SIDRAT appears and opens, disgorging ten Union soldiers.) 
ZOE: So many of them! That thing must be bigger inside than outside, just like the Tardis. 
DOCTOR: I must have a look inside. 
JAMIE: Ah, but be careful now, Doctor! 
BUCKINGHAM: What on earth is it? 
ZOE: It's some kind of space time machine, I think. 
BUCKINGHAM: But it just appeared from nowhere! 
(There is gunfire outside.) 
ZOE: Doctor! Doctor! 
JAMIE: Getting closer! 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, come back! 
(Zoe goes into the SIDRAT.) 
JAMIE: Oh now, Zoe, don't! Lady Jennifer! 
(The SIDRAT door closes as Jamie runs to Buckingham at the barn door.) 
JAMIE: Keep away from the door! 
(The SIDRAT dematerialises.) 
JAMIE: Doctor! No, Zoe, no! Oh no.

Episode Four

[Barn]

(Jamie and Buckingham are stranded in the American Civil War zone. A group of soldiers surround them.) 
THOMSON: And just who might you be?

[SIDRAT]

(Very large inside, with transparent room dividers.) 
ZOE: Doctor, look, it is like the Tardis. Bigger inside than out. 
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoe, you're right. 
ZOE: But who else would have space time machines like the Tardis? 
DOCTOR: Well, there is an answer to that, but I hope, I just hope. 
ZOE: What? 
(Zoe takes a pair of plastic visors with + eye holes from a shelf.) 
ZOE: Doctor, what are these? 
DOCTOR: Zoe, come and see. 
(The Doctor has found a battalion of German WW1 soldiers.) 
ZOE: Why are they just standing there like that? 
DOCTOR: They seem to be in some sort of hypnotic trance. 
(There are Romans in another section.) 
ZOE: Romans, like the ones that attacked us. But these soldiers, what are they here for? 
DOCTOR: They're going to fight, Zoe. That's what soldiers are for. 
ZOE: But they're all from different times. 
(The SIDRAT rematerialises.) 
ZOE: We're landing! 
(The Doctor looks for an empty compartment.) 
DOCTOR: Quick, in here! 
(The Romans march past.) 
ZOE: We could get away. 
DOCTOR: No, we'd only land up right in the middle of another war. 
ZOE: Well, then, what are we going to do? 
DOCTOR: Well this thing must eventually go back to its base. That's where we've got to get to. 
ZOE: Oh but Doctor surely 
(The SIDRAT door closes and it dematerialises.) 
DOCTOR: It's taking off again. That settles it.

[Barn]

THOMSON: Where do you come from? What are you doing here? 
BUCKINGHAM: Well, that's rather difficult to explain actually. 
RILEY: But, you're English. 
JAMIE: I'm not. I'm a Scot. 
RILEY: You're English! Spies for the South! 
JAMIE: Oh, not again! Look, we're not spies. We're nothing to do with your war. 
BUCKINGHAM: We're neutral. 
THOMSON: In a civil war, ma'am, no one's neutral. Now who to you support the North, or the Confederates in the South? 
JAMIE: What's he talking about? 
BUCKINGHAM: American Civil War, Jamie, remember? 
JAMIE: Oh aye. 
RILEY: Oh, they're reb spies, sure enough. Tie 'em up. 
BUCKINGHAM: What are you going to do to us? 
THOMSON: Now that's up to the General. But when we leave here, you're coming with us. 
RILEY: And the General, he doesn't take kindly to spies. He shoots 'em! 
BUCKINGHAM: This is disgraceful. We are neutral civilians. 
RILEY: Okay, over there. 
THOMSON: All right, you guys, ten minutes rest. Not you. Out on sentry duty. 
(No sooner does the soldier step outside than he is shot.) 
THOMSON: Rebs! 
(The Americans are fully occupied.) 
JAMIE: Try and get my knife. 
RILEY: Sarge, there's too many of them! 
THOMSON: Give me your rifle! Okay, make a break for the woods. I'll stay behind and give you covering fire. Move! 
RILEY: Good luck, Sarge. 
(The soldiers withdraw as Buckingham tries to cut Jamie's bonds. Thomson leaves last.) 
BUCKINGHAM: They've forgotten all about us. 
JAMIE: Just as well. How're we doing? 
BUCKINGHAM: Oh. No good, Jamie. Too late. 
(The Confederate army have taken the barn.) 
LEROY: Now don't you worry, ma'am. You're safe now. Oh, just like those Yankees to treat a lady like this. 
BUCKINGHAM: Thank you. 
LEROY: Oh that's my pleasure, ma'am. 
(Leroy unties Buckingham and Jamie.) 
LEROY: Happens all the time, ma'am. Yankees, they take over your house, tie you up, steal your food Oh, would you excuse me, ma'am? 
(Leroy talks to his commander, who we only see from the back. He is bald and as soon as he speaks with a bad southern accent we know who it is.) 
LEROY: The Yankees had some civilian prisoners, sir. 
VON WEICH: These people are enemies of the South. 
LEROY: But Captain 
VON WEICH: The boy is a Yankee soldier, the woman is a spy. You tie them up. 
LEROY: Yes, Captain. 
(Von Weich turns and removes his monocle.)

[War room]

SCIENTIST: But the difficulties of this form of mental processing are considerable. 
WAR CHIEF: I'm not interested in excuses. The process should be universally effective. 
SCIENTIST: We only have a five percent failure rate. 
WAR CHIEF: That five percent is causing us endless trouble. 
SCIENTIST: What harm can they do? 
WAR CHIEF: Sabotage, murder and subversion. Pockets of resistance building up everywhere. 
SCIENTIST: But five percent? So few of them cause you trouble? 
WAR CHIEF: Their numbers are growing all the time. If ever they band together in one organised group, they could cause enough trouble to upset the major plan. The process must be improved. 
SCIENTIST: It already has been. I am hoping to give a first demonstration to the students very shortly. 
WAR CHIEF: I hope for your own sake the experiment will be successful. 
(An alarm sounds.) 
VON WEICH [on monitor]: Von Weich, American Civil War Zone to Central Control. Two more of the escapees from the 1917 zone have been recaptured. The woman and the boy. The older man and the girl are still free. Soldiers are now hunting them down. 
WAR CHIEF: Excellent. When you have captured the other two, send them all here. 
VON WEICH [on monitor]: Sir. 
(Transmission ends.) 
WAR CHIEF: They will make excellent specimens for your reprocessing experiment.

[SIDRAT]

ZOE: We're landing again. 
DOCTOR: Yes, all the soldiers have been delivered, so this must be its base. 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, how do we get back to Jennifer and Jamie? It's working on remote control. 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, there are some controls here. I daresay I could get the hang of them.

[SIDRAT landing bay]

(A man is placing various shapes on a large board in front of him. The SIDRAT materialises in a cubicle behind him, opens its door, and the Doctor and Zoe peek out.) 
DOCTOR: He must be the person who's controlling this thing. 
ZOE: Shush. 
(An 1800s soldier marches past wearing a visor with three vertical slits for eyeholes.) 
ZOE: These glasses. They're both wearing them. 
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right. We'd better put them on. 
(They put on the + visors.) 
DOCTOR: Well, come on, let's explore.

[Barn]

(Jamie and Lady Jennifer are tied up, and their guards are playing cards. A cock crows.) 
JAMIE: How long are we going to be kept here? 
JAMIE: Hey, you with the blond hair. I'm talking to you! 
LEROY: You're staying here until the Captain finds those friends of yours. And then we're going to shoot all four of you together. Yankee spies. 
BUCKINGHAM: But we're not Yankees, we were their prisoners. Don't you remember? 
JAMIE: Aye, you found us. Look, you were going to let us go. 
LEROY: Me let you go? You must be crazy! You're dangerous Yankee spies. 
(Leroy goes back to his game of not fizzbin.) 
BUCKINGHAM: It's no good, Jamie, you can't possibly get it undone. It 
(Someone puts a hand over her mouth. It is a negro soldier, so not a Confederate one.) 
HARPER: Not a sound, Mister. Not one sound. 
(Harper unties them.) 
HARPER: There's a hole in the planks over there. Get a move on. 
(Buckingham, Jamie and Harper sneak past LeRoy and his companion.) 
LEROY: Hey, how about that? I'll get some water. 
(Leroy spots the escapees.) 
LEROY: Hey, look! 
HARPER: Run for it! 
JAMIE: Come on! 
HARPER: No, run on! I'll hold them off. 
JAMIE: Where to? 
HARPER: Trail, due north. Old camp. 
JAMIE: Right. 
(Jamie and Buckingham get away. Harper is captured.) 
VON WEICH: What happened? 
LEROY: They got away, he turned them loose. They can't have got far. 
VON WEICH: Get a cavalry patrol, get after them. Hunt them down. So you turned them loose? Now where're they making for, boy? 
HARPER: Look, I ain't going to tell you nothing. 
(Von Weich fixes his monocle in place.) 
VON WEICH: You're going to tell me where they're making for. 
HARPER: Sorry, Captain, but that stuff doesn't work on me. 
VON WEICH: You're from the Resistance. 
HARPER: That's right, and I'm not one of you. Listen, you all. You're not fighting the war between the States, you know. He's just using you! 
VON WEICH: It's no use. You'll never get them to understand. They're under my control.

[Countryside]

(Jamie runs down a slope.) 
JAMIE: Lady Jennifer? Lady Jennifer? 
(A cavalry man charges at Jamie, swinging his sword. Jamie dodges, and picks up a stout tree branch. As the man comes back for another go, Jamie unhorses him, takes his mount and gallops away.) 
JAMIE: Come on. Yah! Yah! 
(The soldier shoots and misses.)

[Central area]

(The Doctor and Zoe are exploring. The doorways are keyhole shaped.) 
ZOE: We've passed a reception area, living quarters, lecture rooms. It's just like a university. 
DOCTOR: Yes, a sort of training school, but for what? 
ZOE: Shush. 
(Three soldiers from different eras walk past.) 
ZOE: Why didn't they take any notice of us? Because of the glasses? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. Come on, let's see what else we can find. 
GUARD: You two, in! 
DOCTOR: Well we were just 
GUARD: In here! You're late. 
DOCTOR: Oh, well if you insist. 
GUARD: The lecture's already started. 
DOCTOR: Lecture?

[Lecture hall]

SCIENTIST: Should you arrive on another planet, you may not be aware that the problem is to retain the specimen's personality as a fighting man while at the same time putting him under our control. As you know, we remove the human specimens from their own world and time, and place them in a context which seems to them to be the same. It is vital that they continue to believe that they are living their own lives on the planet Earth and fighting the wars from which they were taken. 
ZOE [sotto) : So this isn't Earth. 
DOCTOR: Quite right, Zoe, quite right. 
SCIENTIST: With the majority of human specimens, the process used is both lasting and effective. However, in the case of certain humans of particularly strong character and individuality, the effects of the process have not been permanent. Gradually the processing tended to fade and the specimens developed the ability to pass through the Time Zone Barriers. Some formed themselves into resistance groups which have considerably hampered the progress of our plan. It is to overcome this problem that I have further refined our processing technique. To demonstrate the process I chosen a particularly difficult specimen. A man who finally shook off the effects of the process completely, and allied himself to resistance elements in order to fight us. 
(Guards bring out a gurney on which Carstairs is strapped.) 
SCIENTIST: This Lieutenant Carstairs is a 1917 British army officer, who for some time after his initial processing, believed himself to be fighting for his country. However as I shall now demonstrate, the process has completely lapsed and he is now fully conscious of his surroundings. Where are you? 
CARSTAIRS: I don't know. 
SCIENTIST: Describe what you can see. 
CARSTAIRS: A room. Filled with a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo. Funny people, strange clothes and those sort of glasses that you're wearing. 
(The Doctor gestures Carstairs to keep quiet.) 
SCIENTIST: As you see, he is fully aware of his surroundings and very hostile. After my new technique has been applied, he will not only be completely docile, but will be fully convinced that whatever I tell him will be the truth. 
(The Scientist clamps Carstair's in a metal vice-like device and turns it on.) 
ZOE: Oh, can't we help him? 
DOCTOR: No, no, no, not yet. Later. 
SCIENTIST: This machine is, of course, only a prototype. In due course, other machines will be built to this pattern, capable of processing large groups of specimens simultaneously. 
(The machine finishes its cycle.) 
SCIENTIST: Release him. 
(The guards unstrap Carstairs, who stands up.) 
SCIENTIST: What is your name? 
CARSTAIRS: Carstairs. 
SCIENTIST: I am your superior officer, you know. 
CARSTAIRS: Sorry, sir. 
SCIENTIST: Where are you, Carstairs? 
CARSTAIRS: Well, sir, I'm 
SCIENTIST: You are in my office at headquarters. I am your commanding General. 
CARSTAIRS: Yes, sir. I'm in the General's office. 
SCIENTIST: As you see, whatever he sees he transforms into something he can understand. Now, what is this? 
CARSTAIRS: What, sir? 
SCIENTIST: This. 
CARSTAIRS: I'm sorry, sir, there's nothing there. 
SCIENTIST: Objects which are beyond his comprehension, he will not see at all. Now, who are these people? 
CARSTAIRS: They're my brother officers, sir. Except those two people. Those are German spies!

[Countryside]

(Buckingham is running from a man on horseback until she falls, exhausted. The man dismounts and pulls her to her feet when Jamie gallops up, jumps on him and knocks him out.) 
JAMIE: Come on! There'll be more of them after us! 
(Too late. There are rifles aimed at them from all sides.)

[Lecture hall]

(Carstairs has been strapped down again.) 
CARSTAIRS: But they're German spies! I was at the court martial! You've got to believe me! 
(Carstairs is wheeled away.) 
SCIENTIST: I'll examine him later. 
DOCTOR: Well, I don't think much of that as a demonstration. 
SCIENTIST: Will you kindly return to your place? 
DOCTOR: The man was obviously unhinged as a result of your experiment. 
SCIENTIST: The experiment was successful. 
DOCTOR: Then why did he call me a German spy? It's obviously ridiculous, isn't it. 
SCIENTIST: The aberration is only temporary. He was probably involved with tracking down some German spies before he came here. It has obviously become a fixation. 
DOCTOR: Huh. Then he's obviously no use for our purposes, is he. 
(The Doctor opens up the brain-washing apparatus.) 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, just as I thought. This is your trouble, you know. 
SCIENTIST: Will you leave this apparatus alone? 
DOCTOR: Yes, this circuit is overloading the neural paths. 
SCIENTIST: You are here in the capacity of a student. 
DOCTOR: You didn't de-process that man first, did you. 
SCIENTIST: There was no need. His processing had completely lapsed. You saw that for yourself. 
DOCTOR: I saw a man whose processing had partly lapsed. You should have completely de-processed him first, but I don't suppose you can do that on a machine like this. 
SCIENTIST: Of course we can. It is simply a case of reprogramming these circuits here. 
DOCTOR: What there? 
SCIENTIST: And here. 
DOCTOR: Yes? 
SCIENTIST: And here. 
DOCTOR: Oh.

[Barn]

(Jamie and Buckingham are dumped down next to Harper. Their hands are tied in front of them.) 
BUCKINGHAM: Who are you? Why did you help us? 
HARPER: You came from one of those other wars. 
JAMIE: You know what's going on, then? 
HARPER: You see those guys over there? They think they're fighting the war between the States. This isn't even America. 
BUCKINGHAM: Where do you think it is, then? 
HARPER: Look, you came through one of those mists to get here, right? 
JAMIE: Right. 
HARPER: Well, every time you go through one of those mists you're in some other war, some other place. 
BUCKINGHAM: How long have you realised this? 
HARPER: I started noticing things quite a while back. Then I found some other guys who are the same. 
JAMIE: You mean there's more like you? 
HARPER: Oh, there are gangs of us hiding in the woods. We are trying to fight 
VON WEICH: Now we have combed the entire area and we still haven't found your friends. 
JAMIE: Just a moment. 
VON WEICH: Now you-all are going to tell me where they are. 
JAMIE: I've seen you before, 
(Gunshots. Leroy enters.) 
LEROY: Attack coming from the direction of the woods, sir. 
VON WEICH: Get a patrol out there! Keep them back. 
(Soldiers from different races and wars rush in and overpower the Americans. Von Weich shoots a few and tries to make his escape but is surrounded. A cossack unties the captives.) 
JAMIE: What are you going to do to him? 
HARPER: Kill him, of course. He's one of the people running things around here. 
JAMIE: Nom you mustn't, we need him. 
HARPER: Get out of the way, boy, or I'll have to kill you too!

[Lecture hall]

SCIENTIST: You see, it's perfectly simple. With the circuits arranged in this manner, the machine removes all traces any previous processing. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I see. Yes, that's fascinating. 
SCIENTIST: And since we have now exceeded the time allotted for this demonstration, I suggest you all continue to your next assignment. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. Come along, Zoe. 
(An alarm sounds and the Doctor removes his visor. Guards rush in, then the War Chief enters.) 
WAR CHIEF: Was the experiment successful? 
SCIENTIST: Partly, partly. But the specimen showed signs of mental unbalance after the process. 
WAR CHIEF: Then the modifications were not successful? 
SCIENTIST: But I think we've found the cause. One of the students has been extremely helpful to me. That one over there. 
DOCTOR: Run, Zoe, run! 
WAR CHIEF: Stop them! Stop them! 
(Chaos as the Doctor and Zoe get away. Just outside, Carstairs has been struggling with his restraints and now frees himself as the alarm rips through his head.)

[War room]

WAR CHIEF: Emergency alert, emergency alert. This is the War Chief to all guard posts. Close section areas. Detain two resistance members. 

[SIDRAT landing bay]

(Zoe enters alone. Carstairs creeps up behind her and puts his hand over her mouth.) 
ZOE: Oh, Lieutenant Carstairs, thank goodness! We thought that 
(Carstairs points his revolver at her.) 
ZOE: Well, what are you doing? It's me, Zoe! 
CARSTAIRS: You're a German spy. A German spy. It's my duty to shoot you. 
(Carstairs squeezes the trigger.)

Episode Five

[SIDRAT landing bay]

SCIENTIST: Carstairs! Well done, Lieutenant. You've captured a dangerous spy. 
CARSTAIRS: Yes, and this time she won't escape. 
SCIENTIST: Lieutenant, we mustn't kill her. 
CARSTAIRS: But she's a spy. She must die. She must 
(Carstairs finishes squeezing the trigger, but the chamber is not loaded.) 
SCIENTIST: Lieutenant Carstairs, I am your superior officer. You will obey my commands. 
CARSTAIRS: Yes, sir. Prisoner delivered, sir. 
SCIENTIST: Take her away. Security section. 
(Zoe is taken away by guards.) 
SCIENTIST: Now, Lieutenant, we have work to do. Come with me.

[Barn]

(Von Weich is tied up and has a rifle barrel pointed at his chest by a genuine Highlander.) 
JAMIE: You realise we have saved your life? 
BUCKINGHAM: I don't think he's going to be grateful. We're lucky they didn't kill all three of us. 
JAMIE: Look, how long are we going to be kept here? 
HARPER: Until Russell arrives. He'll decide what to do with you. 
JAMIE: Well, who's Russell? 
HARPER: He's our Captain, he'll be along. 
(Harper goes to Von Weich.) 
HARPER: Where is it? Are you going to tell me where that tunnel is? 
BUCKINGHAM: What tunnel? 
HARPER: Look, we've been watching this place. It's where the recruits keep coming from. 
BUCKINGHAM: But what makes you think there's a tunnel? 
HARPER: Come on, we see the recruits come out of here. 
JAMIE: Look, there's no tunnel. They come out of a big green box, a sort of machine. 
HARPER: A what? Machine? Look, is he crazy or something? 
BUCKINGHAM: I know it's difficult to believe, but it is true. I've seen it myself. 
HARPER: Oh, come on, quit kidding about, huh? We've got to find that tunnel. 
BUCKINGHAM: But even if you do find out how the troops get here, what good is it going to do you? 
HARPER: Maybe we can get out of here back to where we came from. 
BUCKINGHAM: Where do you think you are? 
HARPER: Look, I don't know. All I know is I was brought here and I want to find my way out, right? 
(A bearded Yorkshire Redcoat enters.) 
SPENCER: You found your tunnel yet? 
HARPER: Oh, we're still looking. 
SPENCER: The supplies are loaded. Let's get out of here. 
HARPER: Not until we find that tunnel. 
SPENCER: There's no tunnel. We've got the supplies. Let's go. 
(Spencer takes aim at Von Weich.) 
HARPER: Hey, do you think you're doing? 
SPENCER: We can't afford to take prisoners. 
HARPER: Oh no, you don't! 
(They wrestle for the rifle, and Harper wins. Spencer starts a brief fight and gets it back. He aims it at Harper, gets restrained by a Mexican and Harper punches him. Then they start brawling again. Jamie and Buckingham make for the barn door but a Boer war soldier enters and fires his pistol in the air.) 
RUSSELL: Get up. Up! You're just like a couple of kids, aren't you? I leave you alone and you start fighting amongst yourselves. 
SPENCER: He started it. You ask any of them. 
HARPER: We were taking prisoners. He wanted to shoot them. 
RUSSELL: All right, all right! Spencer, take those stores over to our HQ. 
(Spencer leaves.) 
RUSSELL: You ought to know better, Harper. 
HARPER: He wanted to shoot him. I couldn't let him. 
(Jamie spots Von Weich opening up a panel in the barn wall and grabs him. It is a video monitor.) 
JAMIE: Look at that! Now do you believe us?

[Security section]

(No keyhole doors and plastic hangings, but a swirly design on the walls that makes your eyes ache. A guard drags Zoe in and makes her sit down.) 
ZOE: What's going to happen? What are you going to do to me? Well, you might answer me! 
(A small man with round glasses and a nasal voice walks up onto a long dais across the room.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: You are the one who will answer the questions. 
ZOE: Who are you? I won't tell you anything! 
(The Chief brings over a helmet device, puts it on his own head, lowers a monocular in front of his eyes and turns it on. He adjusts the focus.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: What is you name? 
(Zoe is mesmerised.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: My name is 
ZOE: Zoe Heriot. 
SECURITY CHIEF: To which resistance group do you belong? When did you join the resistance? 
ZOE: I did not join the resistance. 
SECURITY CHIEF: I joined the resistance. What time do you come from? 
ZOE: The twenty first century. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Impossible. There is no twenty first century Time Zone. I was born in 
ZOE: I was born in the twenty first century. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Try again. I was born in 
ZOE: I was born in the twenty first century. 
SECURITY CHIEF: You were first reported in the 1917 Time Zone. 
ZOE: Yes. 
SECURITY CHIEF: How did you get there? 
ZOE: I arrived in the Tardis. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Tardis? What does that mean? 
ZOE: Time and relative dimensions in space. It's a space ship. 
SECURITY CHIEF: You have a space ship? 
ZOE: The ship belongs to the Doctor. 
SECURITY CHIEF: I'm going to show you some photographs. You will identify anyone know to you, particularly this doctor. 
(A series of images appear on Zoe's face.)

[Processing room]

(On the run, the Doctor backs into where the Scientist has got Carstairs on an examination table.) 
SCIENTIST: What are you doing in here? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I was so interested in your demonstration I felt I had to come along and see how you were getting along. 
SCIENTIST: But you? There's a security alarm out for you. 
DOCTOR: Really? Why? 
SCIENTIST: The War Chief, he pointed you out. 
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. Not me, the girl. 
SCIENTIST: Then why did you run? 
DOCTOR: Well I was trying to catch her, of course. Has she been caught? 
SCIENTIST: Yes. I sent her to the security section for questioning. 
DOCTOR: Oh good. How are you getting on with him? 
SCIENTIST: I'm just about to reprocess him. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, this is interesting. I think you'll find that bit goes just there. Will there be enough of these advanced models ready for our major plan? 
SCIENTIST: If I knew the precise timing of the plan that would be easier to answer. 
DOCTOR: Oh but surely you must know, in your position. 
SCIENTIST: Yes of course, just as you do. But only the War Chief knows the timing. Now really, I am very busy. 
DOCTOR: I would consider it a great honour if I could simply stand and watch. 
SCIENTIST: Oh, very well. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. What are we doing now? 
SCIENTIST: I am about to de-process him, just as you suggested at my lecture. 
DOCTOR: Oh I see. Yes, this is intriguing. Will he remember everything when he wakes up? 
SCIENTIST: Yes, he'll remember everything. Would you strap him down, please? As soon as the de-processing is completed everything will return to normal. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, yes. Yes, certainly. 
(The Doctor makes a pretence of tying a knot.) 
DOCTOR: There we are! Is the de-processing complete? 
SCIENTIST: Yes. 
CARSTAIRS: Oh where am I? Oh, Doctor. 
SCIENTIST: You! He recognises you! You're one of 
DOCTOR: No, no, please. Don't hurt him. Get him off. 
(Carstairs grabs the Scientist.) 
DOCTOR: No, don't hurt him. Put him on there. In the machine, quick! 
(Carstairs pushes the Scientist onto the table and the Doctor clamps the brainwash machine around his head then turns it on.) 
DOCTOR: Hoist with his own petard. Come along, Lieutenant. Lieutenant? 
CARSTAIRS: Doctor, where are we? 
DOCTOR: What? Well, what do you remember? 
CARSTAIRS: Well, I remember you and Lady Jennifer. And I was captured, wasn't I? 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right, unfortunately. And brought here, to the aliens war centre and brainwashed again, but you're all right now. 
CARSTAIRS: Oh, I see! 
DOCTOR: I'll explain as we go along. We must find Zoe. Oh. 
(The Doctor turns the machine down a bit.) 
DOCTOR: Better leave him on simmer.

[Barn]

RUSSELL: You expect me to believe all this? 
JAMIE: Yes! They use that thing to talk to each other. Don't touch it! 
BUCKINGHAM: It works like a telephone. 
RUSSELL: And you say that something appears in the middle of this barn and hundreds of men get out of it? A box? 
JAMIE: Aye, we've both seen it. 
(Von Weich gets to the monitor and presses something.) 
JAMIE: Get him off! 
RUSSELL: What's that noise? 
JAMIE: Don't know. 
VON WEICH: You'll find out soon enough.

[Central Control]

TECHNICIAN: This is Central Control, what is your emergency? This is Central Control, what is your emergency?

[Security section]

WAR CHIEF: Did she identify her friends? 
SECURITY CHIEF: No, they are not on our files of resistance people. 
WAR CHIEF: Then they must be a small independent group. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Yes, five of them. First reported in the 1917 Time Zone. One has been caught and is being reprocessed, two believed still at large in the American Civil War Zone. 
WAR CHIEF: And one still at large in this control. 
SECURITY CHIEF: He will be caught. 
WAR CHIEF: He's evaded your security guards so far. Perhaps he will continue to do so? From which time does she originate? 
SECURITY CHIEF: She was a nurse like the other girl. 1917. 
WAR CHIEF: And the man? 
SECURITY CHIEF: The same, 1917. 
WAR CHIEF: Why did they come here? 
SECURITY CHIEF: They had some confused idea they were getting home. 
WAR CHIEF: She told you nothing else? Everything quite straightforward? 
SECURITY CHIEF: Yes. The normal pattern of resistance activity. did you expect something else? 
TECHNICIAN: Emergency call from the American Civil War Zone sir. 
WAR CHIEF: What's wrong? 
TECHNICIAN: The signal was activated, but there was no message, no contact at all. 
WAR CHIEF: All right, I'll deal with it. Come with me. 
SECURITY CHIEF: But the girl. 
WAR CHIEF: She can wait.

[Control area]

(The War Chief walks away. The Doctor and Carstairs come out of hiding.) 
DOCTOR: That must be the Security Room. 
(The Security Chief walks past.)

[Security section]

DOCTOR: Zoe, what have they done to you? Don't you point that thing at me! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, treating a poor young girl like 
(The Doctor walks round the guard so that Carstairs can come up behind him and knock him out.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, well done. 
(The Doctor waves his smelling salts under Zoe's nose.) 
DOCTOR: There we are. Now, are you feeling better? 
ZOE: Oh my head! What happened? 
DOCTOR: That's was just the question I was going to ask you. What did happen? 
ZOE: They questioned me. Someone came in, put on that strange headset and questioned me. 
DOCTOR: Let's have a look. Oh yes, it's a very interesting little gadget. 
ZOE: I saw pictures of people. 
DOCTOR: Really? Oh, well, let's try it, shall we? 
(The Doctor puts the interrogation helmet on.) 
DOCTOR: Now then, where does this switch? Oh yes, oh, with a slight adjustment 
(Pictures of Russell and Harper flicker back and forth.) 
DOCTOR: There we are. Yes. What questions did they ask you about these people, Zoe? 
ZOE: He was talking about the resistance. At first he seemed to think I was one of them. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, the resistance, of course. Yes. That's the American Civil War. The 1914-18 war. Yes, it's all recorded here. Scattered groups of resistance. 
(The Doctor takes the helmet off.) 
DOCTOR: Now if we could organise. Zoe, can you remember all the details about the resistance from that thing? Names, faces, Time Zones and so on? 
ZOE: Yes, of course I can. 
DOCTOR: Good. Then we can return to the Time Zones and organise the resistance into one big army! That way they'll have a better chance. 
CARSTAIRS: But how do we get back? 
DOCTOR: Well, that's simple. The way we came. Come on. 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, are you sure?

[Central Control]

TECHNICIAN: Still no message sir, just the emergency signal. 
WAR CHIEF: Well? This is your sphere of responsibility. 
(War Chief leaves.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: Arrange transportation for guards. 
TECHNICIAN: Central control to Landing Bay, transportation required for security guards. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Security squad to report to Landing Bay immediately. Proceed to American Civil War Zone to investigate reported emergency.

[Central area]

(An alarm goes off and the Doctor, Zoe and Carstairs hide as three rubber-suited guards march through with weapons.) 
ZOE: What was all that about? 
DOCTOR: I don't know, but they're going to the landing bay. Come on. 
(The trio watch as the guards go into a SIDRAT and it dematerialises.)

[Barn]

HARPER: I've posted sentries all around. If they should send in any troops, our outposts will warn us. 
RUSSELL: Good. 
BUCKINGHAM: What if they send one of those things the Doctor went off in? 
JAMIE: Aye, that's what they'll do. Then they can attack us from inside. 
RUSSELL: They've got to get inside first. 
JAMIE: No you don't understand. 
(Materialisation sound.) 
JAMIE: Quick, hide! In here, Lady Jennifer. 
(A SIDRAT appears. Two of the guards come out. Harper approaches them and they use their weapons on him. He falls, staring at nothing. The rest of the resistance grab the guards from behind.) 
SOLDIER: Hold it there! 
JAMIE: Well, we dealt with those all right, didn't we? 
(Russell takes one of the weapons and goes over to where Harper is lying.) 
RUSSELL: There's not a mark on him. But he's dead. But what are these things, how do they work? 
JAMIE: Hey, careful! 
RUSSELL: They don't work. 
JAMIE: Aye, well, you probably have to do something very special with them. 
RUSSELL: Your green box machine. 
JAMIE: Aye, just what we need.

[War room]

SECURITY CHIEF: This emergency call could be resistance activity. There is a large group operating in the American Civil War Zone. 
WAR CHIEF: There seem to be large groups operating in most Zones, and now they're even infiltrating here. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Only two of them and one of those has already been caught. 
WAR CHIEF: Had I not pointed them out, you wouldn't have even known they were here. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Yes, that has been puzzling me. Just how did you recognise them? 
WAR CHIEF: You dare cross-question me?! The security of this entire venture is being threatened by your incompetence. You will find this intruder! 
SECURITY CHIEF: The whole base is being searched. It is only a matter of time. If the mental processing were fully effective 
WAR CHIEF: There would be no need for security. When I came to your people I was promised efficiency and cooperation. Without the knowledge I have, this complete venture would be impossible. 
SECURITY CHIEF: We have given you every facility. If you have complaints I suggest you take them to the War Lord. 
WAR CHIEF: I intend to do so. And now I suggest you finish the interrogation of that girl before she escapes as well.

[Security section]

(The Security Chief enters. He picks up the guard.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: Where is the girl? You fool, where is she?!

[Barn]

JAMIE: Do you not see, though? This thing could take us all back to the place where it's controlled from! 
RUSSELL: How do you know? 
JAMIE: Oh, where do you think those two came from? 
RUSSELL: Well, is it true? Answer me. 
VON WEICH: Do you think I'd help you? 
RUSSELL: You'll do as you're told. Take those two away. 
JAMIE: Now look, you want to find out what's going on, don't you? Och, I can't wait for you to make up your mind! 
BUCKINGHAM: Oh, wait for me. 
JAMIE: Ah, now, Lady Jennifer, I don't think you should come. 
BUCKINGHAM: Because I'm a woman? 
JAMIE: No, er, well, in a way, yes. 
BUCKINGHAM: That settles it then. I'm certainly coming. You can't go alone. 
RUSSELL: No, you're right, miss, he can't. I'm going with him. But you're staying here. 
BUCKINGHAM: Oh now, look here! 
RUSSELL: You're a nurse, you said? 
BUCKINGHAM: Yes, but what's that got to do with it? 
RUSSELL: I've got hundreds of injured men back at my headquarters. They need the help of someone like you. 
BUCKINGHAM: Yes, I suppose you're right. Tell Lieutenant Carstairs that. Well, tell him I'll see him when you all get back. 
JAMIE: Right. 
BUCKINGHAM: Good luck. 
JAMIE: Oh, thank you. 
RUSSELL: Take her back to our headquarters. Thank you, Miss. 
(Buckingham leaves. Russell goes over to Von Weich.) 
RUSSELL: You. Guard him. If he gives you any trouble, shoot him. You two, you're coming with me. Come on, move! 
JAMIE [OC]: Door's closing! 
RUSSELL: Quick! Come on!

[Processing room]

(The Security Chief releases the Scientist from the brain-washing machine.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: What happened? 
SCIENTIST: That young officer got away. 
SECURITY CHIEF: How? 
SCIENTIST: Oh, the one in the lecture who asked all the questions, he tricked me. I must report this to the War Chief. 
SECURITY CHIEF: No! You two, wait outside. 
(The guards leave.) 
SCIENTIST: But he must be informed. 
SECURITY CHIEF: These people are no ordinary resistance group. The girl said they have the secret of space time travel. 
SCIENTIST: That's impossible. 
SECURITY CHIEF: She was under the truth machine. 
SCIENTIST: But the War Chief. He's the only one who understands space time travel. 
SECURITY CHIEF: And his people. 
SCIENTIST: What are you suggesting? 
SECURITY CHIEF: He is not one of our race. Who knows where his true loyalties lie? 
SCIENTIST: But he came to us of his own accord. 
SECURITY CHIEF: He is a traitor to his own people. How can we be sure he is not a traitor to us?

[War room]

TECHNICIAN: Transportation returning from the American Civil War Zone, sir. 
WAR CHIEF: Good. 
TECHNICIAN: But they're not following the routine, sir. They haven't called in. 
WAR CHIEF: Have you tried to make contact? 
TECHNICIAN: Yes, sir. 
WAR CHIEF: All right, inform the Security Chief. No! No, I'll handle this myself. This is the War Chief to Security section. All guards to landing bay. The following procedure will be carried out

[SIDRAT landing bay]

(The Doctor, Zoe and Carstairs are hiding behind the control panel.) 
ZOE: How long have we got to wait here, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Until one of those things arrives. If I can get inside I'm sure I can control it. 
CARSTAIRS: The alarm signal. They've probably found that guard. 
DOCTOR: The light's flashing. That means an arrival. 
(A troop of guards enter and line up.) 
ZOE: It looks as though somebody important's coming. 
(The guards aim their weapons at the materialising SIDRAT. The door opens and Jamie creeps holding a revolver, followed by Russell and an assortment of nationalities.) 
ZOE: It's an ambush! 
(The guards cut them all down, including Jamie.)

Episode Six

[SIDRAT landing bay]

ZOE: Oh Jamie! Doctor, we've got to help them! 
DOCTOR: No, there's nothing we can do. 
CARSTAIRS: We must get away from here. 
ZOE: But we can't. Jamie. We can't. 
CARSTAIRS: Do you want us all to get killed? Go on! 
(The guards drag their victims away.)

[Central area]

ZOE: Oh Doctor, what about Jamie? Have they killed him? 
DOCTOR: I don't know! 
CARSTAIRS: Let's go this way. 
DOCTOR: No, no, this way to the processing room. 
CARSTAIRS: Why do you want to go to the processing room? 
DOCTOR: Don't ask questions, just follow me. 
ZOE: Oh!

[Security section]

SECURITY CHIEF: I believe that amongst this resistance group that attacked the base are people who have arrived on this planet without being brought here by us. 
SCIENTIST: That's impossible! 
SECURITY CHIEF: Is it? What about the girl Zoe, and this man the Doctor she spoke of? She said he had a space time travel machine. 
SCIENTIST: Yes I know, but 
SECURITY CHIEF: Have we taken humans from later than the Earth year 1917? 
SCIENTIST: Of course not. Greater technological knowledge would be dangerous. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Yet this man who tricked you had sufficient technological knowledge to understand the mental processing machinery. 
SCIENTIST: Yes, that's true. But how could these people get here? 
SECURITY CHIEF: The War Chief. His people have the secret of time travel. 
SCIENTIST: Are you suggesting he's bringing in his own people, the Time Lords? 
SECURITY CHIEF: He came to us because he wanted power. Perhaps there are others of his people who feel the same. 
SCIENTIST: Can you prove this? If so, you must tell the War Lord immediately. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Unfortunately I have no proof. You must help me find proof. I insist. This is a matter of security. 
SCIENTIST: All right, what do you want me to do? 
SECURITY CHIEF: These resistance people. Before you reprocess them, study them carefully. If you find anything unusual send the prisoner concerned to me for questioning.

[Central area]

(There are guards near the Processing room.) 
DOCTOR: We've got to get in there. 
CARSTAIRS: Why? 
DOCTOR: Now that room, the other side. That must've been next door. Yes, come on. 
CARSTAIRS: Now what's he up to? 
ZOE: I've no idea, but I think we'd better follow. Come on.

[Clothing store]

(The Doctor, Zoe and Carstairs push their way through hanging racks of greatcoats, to the wall adjoining the processing room.) 
DOCTOR: Some sort of preformed plastic, wouldn't you say, Zoe? 
ZOE: Yes, but why are you so interested in it, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Little bits of metal imbedded in it. Yes, I think these panels must be held together by some kind of magnetic forcefield. Now if I could reverse that field. Cut me off some pieces of tape, will you please, Zoe? 
ZOE: Oh yes. 
DOCTOR: That's right. One there, that's right. And one just there. 
(The Doctor tapes pieces of wire over the curves in the plastic panel.) 

[Processing room]

(Jamie, Russell and other soldiers lie in a heap in the corner while the Scientist uses his helmet device to view another man's brain.) 
SCIENTIST: All right, take him away.

[Clothing store]

CARSTAIRS: Doctor, what on Earth are you doing? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's no secret, boy, it's simply a case of reversing the magnetic field of this panel. 
ZOE: Doctor, why don't you use your sonic screwdriver as a power source? 
DOCTOR: What a good idea, yes. 
ZOE: There's just one thing though. 
DOCTOR: Yes? 
ZOE: All these panels are interlinked. 
DOCTOR: Yes, well? 
ZOE: Well, if you take one away what's to stop all the rest down like a pack of cards? 
DOCTOR: Well, we'll just have to take that risk, won't we? Now then, stand well clear. 
(The Doctor attaches his sonic screwdriver to one end of the final long wire linking all the rest. The panel glows briefly.) 
CARSTAIRS: Nothing's happened. 
DOCTOR: Watch. 
(The Doctor gently removes the panel and sets it down so they look in through a gap over the top. Jamie is being placed on the examination table.) 
ZOE: It's Jamie! He's alive! 
DOCTOR: I hoped he might be. 
ZOE: But how? They shot him down. 
DOCTOR: Well, the guns they use can be adjusted. I think he was just stunned.

[Processing room]

(The Scientist stares into Jamie's brain and sees a regular pattern of oblongs instead of a swirly brain-like one.) 
SCIENTIST: He was right. Take this prisoner to the Security Chief for questioning.

[Clothing store]

ZOE: Doctor, why are they taking him away? 
DOCTOR: I think they've possibly discovered that he was never processed. 
CARSTAIRS: We'd better get him out of there, then. 
DOCTOR: No, no, wait.

[Processing room]

WAR CHIEF: Have you started the reprocessing yet? 
SCIENTIST: No, I've just been carrying out the preliminary examinations. 
WAR CHIEF: Why? Why not just reprocess them? 
SCIENTIST: I, well, these people have shown considerable courage and enterprise. They may make future leaders. 
WAR CHIEF: Where is this prisoner being taken? 
SCIENTIST: Oh, the Security Chief. He wants to question one of them before reprocessing. 
WAR CHIEF: Really? Why this one in particular? 
SCIENTIST: Oh, he just seemed to be the most suitable. 
WAR CHIEF: For what reason? For what reason! 
SCIENTIST: His brain patterns are different. 
WAR CHIEF: Different how? 
SCIENTIST: Well, he appears not to have been processed before. 
WAR CHIEF: Really? How interesting. All right, carry on. (The guards carry Jamie away.) 
WAR CHIEF: But in future inform me of all such unusual developments. 
(The War Chief leaves.) 
SCIENTIST: Prepare the reprocessing machine. We shall begin with this one.

[Clothing store]

ZOE: Oh Doctor, we're too late. Where have they taken him? 
DOCTOR: I don't know, but don't worry, at least we know that he's alive. Now then, we've got to get in there. Lieutenant? 
CARSTAIRS: Right, sir.

[Processing room]

(While the Scientist adjusts his brain-washing machine, Carstairs goes through the hole in the wall and grabs the scientist's assistant. He bundles him unceremoniously back into the clothing store.) 
DOCTOR: I think you'll find that bit goes there. 
SCIENTIST: Ah, thank you!

[Barn]

VON WEICH: How long do you intend keeping me here? 
MOOR: Until they come back. 
(David Troughton, Patrick's son.) 
VON WEICH: And supposing they don't come back? 
(Von Weich stands.) 
VON WEICH: I'd like some water. 
MOOR: All right. Sit down. 
(Trying to keep his rifle aimed at Von Weich all the time, Moor sidles towards a canteen. As soon as he looks away, Von Weich tries to go for the communications device.) 
MOOR: Stop! Try that again and I'll kill you.

[Security section]

SECURITY CHIEF: But who sent you here? 
JAMIE: Nobody sent us. I came with the Doctor. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Why did he decide to come to this planet? 
JAMIE: He didn't. It was an accident. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Accident? Explain. 
JAMIE: It's the Tardis, you see. He can't control it. We just arrived here. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Was the Doctor summoned here by one of us? 
JAMIE: No, we just arrived. 
(The War Chief and a guard enter.) 
WAR CHIEF: Don't let me interrupt you. 
SECURITY CHIEF: The questioning is over. 
WAR CHIEF: What have you learnt? 
SECURITY CHIEF: Nothing of importance. 
WAR CHIEF: Really? Will you be questioning the others? 
SECURITY CHIEF: They are all from the same resistance group. They will all tell the same story. 
WAR CHIEF: But this one is different, surely? 
SECURITY CHIEF: Why should he be? 
WAR CHIEF: This one hasn't been processed before, has he? 
SECURITY CHIEF: It's possible. 
WAR CHIEF: It's a fact! Why was I not informed? 
SECURITY CHIEF: This is a matter of security. Security is my responsibility, as you often remind me. 
WAR CHIEF: Your first responsibility is to me. 
SECURITY CHIEF: No! My first responsibility is to the War Lord and to my people. 
WAR CHIEF: You don't trust me. But if you question my loyalty, tell the War Lord. But I warn you, be absolutely sure of your suspicions because if you accuse me without positive proof, I shall crush you. 
[Processing room]

(The Doctor is using his smelling salts on Russell while Carstairs reloads his revolver.) 
CARSTAIRS: Can't you hurry it up? 
RUSSELL: What happened? Where am I? 
DOCTOR: It's all right. You're quite safe. 
RUSSELL: Who are you? 
DOCTOR: We're your friends. 
CARSTAIRS: You'll have to hurry it up, Doctor. 
RUSSELL: Doctor? You must be the one that Jamie was talking about. Where is he? 
DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid that they've taken him away. Now, up you get. 
CARSTAIRS: Doctor, we're wasting time. 
(A guard comes past the open door to the central area and Carstairs shoots him.) 
CARSTAIRS: Come on, Doctor, we must get out of here! 
DOCTOR: Quickly through the gap in the wall here, Zoe, help him. 
ZOE: Yes. 
(The Doctor tries to take the brain washing machine off its stand.) 
CARSTAIRS: Come on, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: I'll be a minute. 
(The alarm sounds. Carstairs shoots at another guard outside.) 
CARSTAIRS: Come on, Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Just a minute! 
CARSTAIRS: No, now. or we'll all be caught! Come on. 
(The Doctor abandons the machine.)

[Clothing store]

(Carstairs and the Doctor replace the wall panel.) 
RUSSELL: What is this place? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's the headquarters of the people who are running this whole disgraceful business. 
RUSSELL: Just the people I want to get my hands on. 
DOCTOR: Yes, it's not quite as simple as that. There are rather a lot of them. 
RUSSELL: I don't care how many of them there are! 
DOCTOR: They have rather sophisticated weapons. You wouldn't stand a chance. 
RUSSELL: Oh. So what do we do now? 
DOCTOR: We're going to return to the time zones and organise the resistance into one big army! 
RUSSELL: If you can find them. They're spread all over the place. I've been trying to link them up myself, but it's finding them and you don't know who you can trust. 
DOCTOR: Ah yes, we do now. My friend Zoe has memorised an entire list of the resistance and their whereabouts. 
ZOE: Yes, I memorised the files when I was in the security room. 
DOCTOR: Now I must get you all back to the landing bay. 
CARSTAIRS: Those guards'll be all over the place. 
DOCTOR: Yes, what we need is some kind of disguise.

[Barn]

VON WEICH: British private, aren't you? Nineteenth century. 
MOOR: You can see that, can't you. 
VON WEICH: Oh would you mind reaching my monocle for me? It's in my pocket there. Thank you. 
MOOR: Now sit down again. 
VON WEICH: Don't you talk to me like that. I'm a British Officer! 
MOOR: No, you're not. You're my prisoner. 
VON WEICH: I'm not your prisoner, Moor. I'm your commanding Officer. Do you understand? 
MOOR: I'm not, I'm not in the army. The resistance I'm in! 
VON WEICH: You're in the British army, Private Moor, the year is 1871. You're in the British army, and I'm your commanding Officer. Now, untie me.

[Central area]

SECURITY CHIEF: (to War Chief) They are in here, trapped. (to guards) Right, in!

[Processing room]

SECURITY CHIEF: They were seen here by my men. 
WAR CHIEF: Where are they now, vanished into thin air? 
SECURITY CHIEF: There is only one way they could have escaped. By use of a space time machine. 
(The War Chief goes across to the far wall and pushes at several panels.) 
WAR CHIEF: I'm sorry to crush your wild theories. 
(He pushes the loose panel.) 
WAR CHIEF: There's your space time machine. 
SECURITY CHIEF: After them! 
WAR CHIEF: You're too late for that. They will be on their way to the landing bay by now, I should imagine. Try and get there before them.

[Security section]

(Jamie wakes to see a figure in a greatcoat and gas mask.) 
JAMIE: Ah! 
DOCTOR: It's all right, Jamie, it's me. 
JAMIE: Oh. 
DOCTOR: All right, put on this great coat. 
JAMIE: Where's Zoe? What's happened? 
DOCTOR: She's waiting outside. Now come along.

[Central area]

DOCTOR: Fall in by twos. Come along, hurry up. There's no time to be lost. 
JAMIE: Zoe. 
DOCTOR: Are you ready? Right. Quick march!

[SIDRAT landing bay]

(Two soldiers grab the technician and drag him away.) 
ZOE: Are you sure you can work these controls, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so, Zoe. Now let me see. 
ZOE: There are more guards! 
DOCTOR: Oh my goodness! 
(The Doctor moves some control rods and sets up a protective force field.) 
DOCTOR: There, that should stop them! 
(Russell and Carstairs deal with the two that got through with help from Jamie.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie! All right! Now, I'll preset it for the 1917 zone, and off we go. 
ZOE: Doctor, how did you do it so easily? 
DOCTOR: It's not very difficult, Zoe. Now the doors. 
(A SIDRAT open.) 
DOCTOR: Come along. Don't be afraid, you've gone before. 
CARSTAIRS: After you, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: No, no, I shall follow in a few moments. 
ZOE: You mean you're staying here? 
DOCTOR: No, but I must get the processing machine. 
JAMIE: Ah, if you're staying, I'd better stay too. 
CARSTAIRS: You can count on me then, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Oh, very well. Go on, Zoe, off you go. We'll follow in a few minutes. Good luck. 
(Zoe, Russell and the soldiers go into the SIDRAT and the Doctor dematerialises it remotely.) 
CARSTAIRS: What are you going to do about those guards, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: We're going to let them in. 
(The guards run into an empty bay, then out again.)

[Barn]

VON WEICH: You understand now, Moor? I am your commanding Officer. 
MOOR: You, you are my Commanding Officer. Yes, sir. 
VON WEICH: Good, good. Now, Moor, give me your gun. 
(As Moor is about to hand it over, the SIDRAT materialises and Russell steps out.) 
VON WEICH: Moor, shoot them! That's an order! 
RUSSELL: Back in there, quick. Moor? Moor, it's me, Russell. 
VON WEICH: Private Moor, shoot him. 
RUSSELL: Don't take any notice of him, Moor. You're one of us, one of the resistance, remember? 
MOOR: Resistance? No, I'm in the army. Oh oh two three nine Moor. Private Moor. 
VON WEICH: Shoot him! 
(Russell reaches out, grabs Moor's rifle barrel and disarms him. The two men struggle and Moor gets Russell's service revolver from its holster. Russell forces him to drop it and they continue fighting until Moor is knocked out.) 
VON WEICH: Stay. 
(Von Weich picks up the revolver.) 
VON WEICH: You come one step nearer you'll die. Good. Now you're both coming back with me. Get inside the machine. 
RUSSELL: No, you'll have to shoot me first. 
VON WEICH: Very well, if you prefer to die that's your affair! 
(Gunshot! Von Weich falls to the ground with a bullet from Moor's rifle inside him.) 
MOOR: I had to shoot him, didn't I? 
RUSSELL: Thank goodness you did, lad. 
MOOR: I'm not sure what happened. 
RUSSELL: You've just saved our lives, that's what happened.

[Security section]

(While Jamie helps the Doctor get the brain wash machine.) 
WAR CHIEF: So you have lost them. They have got away. 
SECURITY CHIEF: One of them knew how to operate our space time machines. 
WAR CHIEF: Are you blaming me for that? 
SECURITY CHIEF: You knew they would head for the landing bay. You knew one of them could operate our machines. 
WAR CHIEF: Of course. That is, after all, how they got here. Logic seems to be your weak point. Do something about this resistance group before the War Lord arrives. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Wherever they are, I shall find them.

[Processing room]

JAMIE: Is this all right, Doctor? 
(Jamie holds out a knapsack.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, that's splendid. Put it in. 
(The Doctor puts the machine into it.) 
DOCTOR: There we are. That's it, right. Come on, off we go. Just a minute. Hold that. 
(The Doctor hands the sack to Jamie.) 
JAMIE: Now what? 
CARSTAIRS: What are those, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: They're gas filled valves. Come on. 
(They run out of the room and the Scientist sneaks in.)

[SIDRAT]

(Wearing the gas mask, the Doctor throws one the gas filled valves onto the landing bay floor. The technicians and guards collapse, and the Doctor manipulates the controls to open a SIDRAT. They rush in and it dematerialises.) 
JAMIE: Did we get away all right? 
DOCTOR: Yes I hope so, Jamie. There we go. 
(The sound suddenly stops.) 
DOCTOR: But, they must have stopped it from the outside. 
JAMIE: Well can they get in the doors? 
DOCTOR: No, not now. I've set the emergency lock. 
JAMIE: Will we still get away all right? 
DOCTOR: Yes, it's only a question of overriding the master control. Now, it's a slightly different design to the Tardis. 
SECURITY CHIEF [OC]: Open the doors and surrender. You are trapped.

[SIDRAT landing bay]

SECURITY CHIEF: There is no chance of escape! Surrender and we will spare your lives.

[SIDRAT]

CARSTAIRS: What are you going to do, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Don't worry. These things are impregnable against outside attack. 
JAMIE: You mean like the Tardis? 
SECURITY CHIEF [OC]: This is your last chance. Surrender now!

[SIDRAT landing bay]

WAR CHIEF: How do you propose to get them out? 
SECURITY CHIEF: We will wait. They will come out. 
WAR CHIEF: No, we won't wait. We'll force them out. 
SECURITY CHIEF: What do you intend to do? 
WAR CHIEF: Activate the dimensional control.

[SIDRAT]

JAMIE: Are we doing all right, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Very nicely, Jamie. Now, don't worry. Nothing can happen to us in here. 
CARSTAIRS: Am I seeing things? The walls! Look! 
(The walls are getting closer.) 
JAMIE: And the ceiling too! 
DOCTOR: Oh, what have they done? 
(The ceiling drops, forcing the Doctor, Carstairs and Jamie to their knees.)

[SIDRAT landing bay]

WAR CHIEF: You must surrender, Doctor, or you will all be crushed to death. You have thirty seconds to decide.

[SIDRAT]

WAR CHIEF [OC]: Thirty seconds.

Episode Seven

[SIDRAT]

(The inside is now barely big enough to hold the three men.) 
WAR CHIEF [OC]: Thirty seconds before you are crushed to death. 
CARSTAIRS: What are we going to do, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: We've got no choice. We have to do what they say. 
WAR CHIEF [OC]: Twenty seconds!

[SIDRAT landing bay]

(The War Chief moves more controls on the panel.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: What are you doing now? 
WAR CHIEF: Reducing the dimensions further. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Wait! 
(The SIDRAT opens and the Doctor crawls out waving a white handkerchief.) 
WAR CHIEF: Bring out the others. 
DOCTOR: What are you going to do with us? 
WAR CHIEF: Bring out the others! 
DOCTOR: I won't have my friends ill-treated, you know. 
SECURITY CHIEF: You are in no position to make terms. 
DOCTOR: I am here under a flag of truce. I demand to know what you are going to do with us. 
WAR CHIEF: For the last time, tell your friends to come out. Or would you sooner they were crushed to death? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I think that that's a perfectly horrid idea. 
(The Doctor throws down his last gas-filled diode.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: Guards, stop him!
(While everyone else is choking on the gas, the Doctor has his handkerchief over his mouth, dashes to the control panel, sets the dimension controls back to normal and removes other control symbols before running back into the SIDRAT and closing its door.)

[SIDRAT]

JAMIE: Oh, well done, Doctor.

[SIDRAT landing bay]

(The SIDRAT dematerialises.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: Can't you stop them? 
WAR CHIEF: He's locked off the controls and taken the master circuit rods. What an ingenious fellow he is. 
SECURITY CHIEF: His ingenuity could ruin everything. Alert all time zones! 
WAR CHIEF: I suggest we pay particular attention to the 1917 zone. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Is that where they are going? 
WAR CHIEF: I can't tell for sure. These master circuit rods could guide the machine to any one of the time zones.

[SIDRAT]

(The Doctor puts the new control symbols on the panel by the door.) 
JAMIE: Well, where are we going, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Anywhere but the 1917 zone, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Are we not going back to Zoe and the Tardis? 
DOCTOR: Yes, eventually, but not just now. That's where they'll be looking for us. 
CARSTAIRS: What are we going to do then, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well, we'll go into one of the nearby zones and cross the time zone barrier on foot. Oh! Ah, yes, here we are. (A final symbol goes on the panel.)

[War room]

SECURITY CHIEF: Haven't you traced them yet? 
WAR CHIEF: It's impossible to pick them up when the SIDRAT is still moving. I'll pinpoint their position the moment it lands. 
SECURITY CHIEF: All time zones are ready to hunt them down as soon as you provide the necessary information. 
(An alarm sounds.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: The War Lord is arriving from the home planet. 
WAR CHIEF: He's chosen rather an inconvenient time. 
SECURITY CHIEF: I shall go and receive him. 
WAR CHIEF: No, I'll receive him. You stay here and supervise the capture of that resistance group. 
SECURITY CHIEF: The war Lord will expect me! 
WAR CHIEF: The War Lord will expect everything to be running smoothly and under control, which, at the moment it isn't. 
(The War Chief leaves.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: Keep your eyes on the operations maps! I want to know the moment that capsule arrives in a time zone.

[SIDRAT]

(Mealtime for a change. Carstairs and Jamie are eating apples.) 
JAMIE: Its taking its time, isn't it? 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. I probably confused the controls readjusting them in space, in 
CARSTAIRS: You've no idea which zone we're going to land in, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well, no, not really, no. 
JAMIE: Oh, just like the Tardis, eh? 
(The SIDRAT rematerialises.) 
DOCTOR: Come on, here we go. Help me on with the processing machine. Now remember, as soon as we land we must make ourselves scarce. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
DOCTOR: Well they're bound to be on the alert for us.

[War room]

SECURITY CHIEF: Alert the Roman zone commanders in sector five. Transmit map references and order troops to surround the area. These resistance people must be captured or destroyed. 
(A technician leaves. A man in black with the War Chief and an armed guard has arrived.) 
WAR LORD: So my information is correct. I've heard disquieting rumours of serious trouble here. Are they true? 
(Philip Madoc is back.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: There have been temporary difficulties. 
WAR LORD: But they have been overcome? 
SECURITY CHIEF: Almost. 
WAR LORD: War Chief. The defective processing machinery, has it been rectified? 
WAR CHIEF: Your scientists did get effective machines, but 
WAR LORD: But what? 
WAR CHIEF: Unfortunately, it was removed by an intruding party of resistance men. 
WAR LORD: They penetrated the control area? They just walked in? How? 
SECURITY CHIEF: I have the situation under control, War Lord. It is only a matter of time before they are recaptured. 
WAR LORD: Then I hope that time is on your side. 
(A technician brings a report to the Security Chief.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: Report from the Roman zone.

[Hillside]

(Carstairs is looking at a map as they walk.) 
CARSTAIRS: Are you sure this is the right way, sir? 
DOCTOR: Well, I don't know. It's rather difficult to tell, isn't it. 
JAMIE: I think it is, Doctor. I seem to remember that hill. 
CARSTAIRS: Isn't this where we were attacked by the Romans? 
DOCTOR: Huh? 
(And here they come again, charging along the ridge.) 
DOCTOR: Come on! Back to the time zone barrier!

[War room]

WAR CHIEF: They're escaping again. Moving back to the time zone barrier. Our processed Roman legions won't be able to follow them there. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Then we will send in my security guards from the control centre. 
WAR CHIEF: No, not again. We are carrying out a delicately controlled operation. The presence of guards in the time zones could stretch he credulity of the processed humans. It would be most dangerous. 
SECURITY CHIEF: It will be even more dangerous if we allow this Doctor to remain alive. 
WAR CHIEF: Have you looked for this space time machine of theirs? 
SECURITY CHIEF: What use is that to us? 
WAR CHIEF: They will no doubt try to return to it. That's where we should be looking for them. It's a simple enough conclusion. You might even have reached it yourself. 
SECURITY CHIEF: I have reached a number of conclusions about you and about this man, the Doctor. 
WAR CHIEF: Indeed? Then perhaps you'd like to share them with us? 
SECURITY CHIEF: This Doctor arrived here on this planet we have chosen for the war games. He brought with him companions who have not been subjected to our mental processing. 
WAR CHIEF: A fact you tried to conceal. 
SECURITY CHIEF: They came in a space time machine. The secret of space time travel is known only to you and to your people. 
WAR CHIEF: And I brought that secret here. 
SECURITY CHIEF: You have shown us how to operate these machines, but not how to construct them. These people were summoned by one who is in league with his own kind, plotting to betray us! 
WAR CHIEF: You cannot produce one single atom of proof! 
SECURITY CHIEF: The accumulation of evidence is overwhelming! 
WAR LORD: That's enough! That's enough from both of you. Now, I am tired of this eternal bickering. Your inability to work together is endangering our whole plan. You have a choice. Co-operate or be replaced.

[Mist]

JAMIE: Are we safe in here, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, they can't follow us into a time zone barrier. Oh, Lieutenant Carstairs, do you feel all right? 
CARSTAIRS: Perfectly, why? 
DOCTOR: Oh, good. That means the processing machine is working all right. 
JAMIE: Oh, where do we go from now, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Just follow me, Jamie. 
(The three men arrive to the sound of distant warfare. A man in a small weapons emplacement gets on his field telephone.)

[British command post]

(The Sergeant Major takes the call.) 
BURNS: I'll tell General Smythe immediately, sir. Excuse me, sir. 
SMYTHE: What is it? 
BURNS: Report from number three observation point, sir. Three persons spotted answering to the descriptions of the two spies and the officer wanted for desertion, sir. 
SMYTHE: Map? 
BURNS: They'd be just about, er, here, sir. 
SMYTHE: How very convenient. Right next to a machine gun emplacement.

[No Man's Land]

(The Doctor, Jamie and Carstairs run down the muddy bank near the machine gun. The Doctor falls.) 
CARSTAIRS: Come on, Doctor. 
(The machine gun fires.) 
CARSTAIRS: Take cover! They've got us pinned down. 
(To the rear of the machine gunners are Zoe and two resistance fighters. They knock out the gunners with their musket butts. The Doctor, Jamie and Carstairs have been surrounded by British troops.) 
ZOE: No, don't shoot. You'll hit my friends. We'll follow them.

[British command post]

SMYTHE: You've caused me a great deal of trouble. 
DOCTOR: Good, I'm very glad to hear it. I suppose you're going to subject us to another one of your farcical courts martial? 
SMYTHE: In your case, that won't be necessary. You have already been condemned to death. 
DOCTOR: And what about my friends? 
SMYTHE: They will be given the chance to redeem themselves, in the most dangerous sector of the front line. 
DOCTOR: After some more of your mental processing, I suppose? 
SMYTHE: They will have the opportunity of making the supreme sacrifice for their King and country. 
CARSTAIRS: You can drop all that nonsense. We know what's going on. 
SMYTHE: Do you, Carstairs? 
CARSTAIRS: Yes. This isn't the war. We're not even on our own planet. Do you realise that, Sergeant Major? This General of yours isn't even a human being. 
(Smythe puts on his spectacles.) 
SMYTHE: The prisoner is delirious, Sergeant Major. He's talking nonsense. 
BURNS: Yes, sir, delirious, sir. Talking nonsense, sir. 
CARSTAIRS: Listen to me, Sergeant Major! 
SMYTHE: It's no use, Carstairs. Nothing you say will have any effect. Sergeant Major, prepare a firing squad. 
BURNS: Sir! 
(Burns leaves.) 
DOCTOR: Do you have the authority to have me killed? 
SMYTHE: I don't need any authority. 
DOCTOR: Your alien superiors will want to question me. 
SMYTHE: You've caused me a great deal of trouble and embarrassment. Now, I'm afraid, you're going to pay for it with your life! 
DOCTOR: So you're simply being malicious! 
SMYTHE: Revenge can be very satisfying. 
BURNS: Firing party ready, sir! 
SMYTHE: Take him away! 
JAMIE: Look, leave him alone! 
SOLDIER: Come along! 
SMYTHE: Keep these other two here.

[Smythe's room]

(Smythe reports in on the video link.) 
SMYTHE: Smythe, 1917 zone. I have recaptured three of the escaped prisoners. 
WAR CHIEF [OC]: Excellent!

[War room]

WAR CHIEF: I want them sent here immediately. 
SMYTHE [on monitor]: Unfortunately one of them is already dead. 
WAR CHIEF: Which one? 
SMYTHE [on monitor]: The one that calls himself the Doctor. He was shot trying to escape. 
WAR CHIEF: Did you recover the machine? 
SMYTHE [on monitor]: Machine? 
WAR CHIEF: Didn't you receive your instructions? They took with them the new processing machine. It must be recovered! 
SMYTHE [on monitor]: Yes, of course I will. 
WAR CHIEF: Don't fail us, Smythe. The War Lord is here and he doesn't like failures.

[British command post]

JAMIE: (sotto) We've got to try and save the Doctor. 
CARSTAIRS: (sotto) I wouldn't get anywhere near him. 
(Smythe enters.) 
JAMIE: (sotto) How about if I 
CARSTAIRS: (sotto) Quiet. 
SMYTHE: That machine you took, where is it? Where is it?! 
CARSTAIRS: The Doctor's got it. 
BURNS [OC]: Firing squad, attention! Load! 
CARSTAIRS: Only the Doctor knows where it is. You kill him, you'll never get it back. 
BURNS: Squad, aim. Squad 
SMYTHE: Stop! 
(Gunfire outside.) 
SMYTHE: Jesus! 
(Smythe draws his revolver and goes to the door. He fires as the long barrel of a musket appears. With another expletive he goes into his room. Jamie and Carstairs disarm their captors as more resistance fighters enter.) 
JAMIE: Russell! The Doctor, what happened to him? 
RUSSELL: I don't know. We've just attacked the front of the building. 
JAMIE: Doctor! I thought they'd shot you! 
DOCTOR: Fortunately, Zoe arrived in time. Where's General Smythe? 
CARSTAIRS: He's in there. 
DOCTOR: What? But he'll be calling for help. You've got to stop him! 
RUSSELL: Quick, lads. Over here!

[Smythe's room]

SMYTHE: It's the resistance. They're attacking in force. You must send help! 
WAR CHIEF [on monitor: Did you recover the machine? 
SMYTHE: I haven't had a chance. You must send help! 
WAR CHIEF [on monitor]: New master circuit rods for the travel machines are being prepared. 
SMYTHE: You must send help now! 
WAR CHIEF [on monitor]: Smythe, deactivate the area control.

[British command post]

(The fighters have failed to break down the door to Smythe's room.) 
RUSSELL: Right lads, stand back.

[Smythe's room]

WAR CHIEF [on monitor]: Deactivate the area control. Deactivate the area control. Deactivate the area control! 
(Smythe removes the cover from the fireplace to reveal a computer. He is just about to pull out some units when Russell bursts in. They exchange shots and Smythe dies.) 
RUSSELL: Quick, Doctor, in here. Look. I think he was trying to destroy it. 
DOCTOR: Why would he want to do that?

[War room]

(Zoe turns off the monitor.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: They have taken over the Chateau. 
WAR CHIEF: And the Doctor is still alive. Smythe was a fool. He deserved to die. 
WAR LORD: The Doctor has the processing machine. Does he have the knowledge and the ability to use it? 
WAR CHIEF: Yes. I think he has. 
WAR LORD: Then the situation's urgent, isn't it? Fortunately, they're in a very vulnerable position now. If they've made a mass attack then all their forces are concentrated in one position, the chateau. 
SECURITY CHIEF: This time we must use the guards. 
WAR CHIEF: No, we will invalidate the experiment. If they are concentrated in this one place, it would be simple enough to wipe them out with an artillery barrage. 
WAR LORD: Simple, but just as foolish as using the security guards. A violent attack on the Chateau would almost certainly destroy the control units there. The time zone barriers would disappear. No, use the conventional forces. Could be quite amusing. A mass attack on the chateau. A pincer movement with our little band of heroes caught in it's jaws.

[Smythe's room]

ZOE: What do you make of it, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I'm not sure, Zoe. I think they've got something to do with the time zone barriers. 
JAMIE: Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Huh? 
JAMIE: There's troops moving in from all sides. 
DOCTOR: Oh no! Ohm my word, How many resistance did you bring? 
ZOE: Well, not enough to stand up against an army. Hadn't we better try and get away? 
JAMIE: Look, it's too late for that. We're surrounded.

[British command post]

CARSTAIRS: We could try and break out through here. Some of us might get away. 
RUSSELL: Not a chance. We'd be caught between two armies. 
CARSTAIRS: Yeah. 
DOCTOR: Mister Russell, how long can you hold on here? 
RUSSELL: Well, not long, Doctor. Our forward position's about to fall back already. 
DOCTOR: Well, you must hold on as long as you can. I think I've got the answer. You see, we have to have a safe base from which to fight these people. I must go and get on with my work. 
RUSSELL: What does he mean? What's he up to? 
CARSTAIRS: I don't know, But we'll do as he says and stick it out here for as long as we can. 
RUSSELL: That won't be long, sir. Listen to that lot. 
CARSTAIRS: Yeah.

[Smythe's room]

DOCTOR: Give some help, Zoe. I want to dismantle this. 
ZOE: What for? 
DOCTOR: To find out how it works, of course. Don't ask questions, just do what I say. 
JAMIE: Well, what can I do? 
DOCTOR: You go and ask. You go and help Mister Russell. 
JAMIE: Right. 
(Jamie leaves.) 
DOCTOR: Now then. 
(The Doctor removes a circuit pack and starts to take it apart with sonic screwdriver.)

[War room]

WAR CHIEF: British troops are advancing from here and here, converging with French troops advancing from here. Germans are advancing from this side together with the Austro-Hungarians. 
SECURITY CHIEF: It is taking longer than it should. These resistance people are putting up a good fight. 
WAR CHIEF: They will be crushed. 
SECURITY CHIEF: They have escaped before. They could do it again. 
WAR CHIEF: Not this time. I am in control. 
SECURITY CHIEF: And the Doctor? Will he die with the rest? 
WAR CHIEF: Why shouldn't he? 
SECURITY CHIEF: He seems to have a charmed life. 
WAR CHIEF: Only when you have a hand in his fate. This Doctor will die.

[British command post]

(Behind a barricade of furniture, the resistance are exchanging fire with the troops outside.) 
JAMIE: It's no good. 
RUSSELL: This is only the vanguard. We know there's more of them to come. Grenade! 
JAMIE: Look out! 
(Russell pulls the French soldier into the room through the French windows. Jamie throws the grenade back outside.) 
JAMIE: Duck! 
CARSTAIRS: It's no good, Russell. We must get away from here.

[Smythe's room]

CARSTAIRS: Doctor, you and Zoe must try and get away from here. 
DOCTOR: No, I don't think that will be necessary. 
CARSTAIRS: But Doctor 
DOCTOR: Shall we try it, Zoe? Right, here we go. 
(The Doctor turns a knob at the bottom of the computer.) 
CARSTAIRS: Doctor, now what? 
DOCTOR: Shush! Listen. 
(No more gunfire.) 
CARSTAIRS: Stopped. It's stopped.

[British command post]

CARSTAIRS: Not a sound. 
RUSSELL: Some sort of trick. 
DOCTOR: No, Mister Russell, look out of the window. 
JAMIE: Aye, a mist. 
DOCTOR: Yes. I've set up a time zone barrier all round the chateau. 
RUSSELL: So none of the processed people will be able to get at us. 
DOCTOR: Exactly, but your people can come and go just as you please. At last we've got a safe base from which to fight them! We can carry out the next step in complete safety. 
CARSTAIRS: What next step, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Is this one of yours, Mister Russell? 
RUSSELL: No, Doctor. I pulled him through the window. 
DOCTOR: He's just the man we need.

[War room]

SECURITY CHIEF: So much for your armies of processed humans. 
WAR CHIEF: Smythe should have destroyed the machine. 
SECURITY CHIEF: We should have sent in my security guards. 
WAR CHIEF: And ruin the entire experiment? 
WAR LORD: The Security Chief is right. You have failed. And your leadership of the security forces has hardly been spectacularly successful. I will take charge of the whole situation. Now listen carefully, this is what I plan to do.

[British command post]

(The French soldier is being de-processed.) 
DOCTOR: I think that will do, Jamie. 
(The machine stops and Jamie, who is holding it, backs away from the French soldier.) 
DU PONT: Qui et vous? Qu'est ce qui se passe? 
DOCTOR: I think it's worked. 
CARSTAIRS: He seems pretty confused. Est ce que vous voyez ca? 
DU PONT: Oui, je me vois bien. Vous ne pas les bosch? 
CARSTAIRS: I think it has worked, Doctor. At least he can see we're not Germans. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear. I wonder whether he's completely back to normal? 
DU PONT: Je comprends rien. Qui et vous? Qu' est ce que vous faites ici dans le chateau? 
CARSTAIRS: I think he's all right. He just wants to know what we're doing here. Er, Nous sommes le, le, le, resistance. Resistance? Do you speak English? 
DU PONT: English? You English? 
RUSSELL: We're all sorts here, lad. 
DU PONT: Ne comprends pas. 
CARSTAIRS: Nous combatons le. Er, sorry, my French isn't up to it. 
DOCTOR: Look, try. Try to explain to him what's been happening. 
CARSTAIRS: Venez ici, monsieur. 
RUSSELL: So you bring people back to normal with that thing? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes. Everyone we capture we can convert to our side. You'll soon have all the men you need. 
RUSSELL: Yes, but if you're going to do them all one by one, it'll take until doomsday. 
DOCTOR: Look, Mister Russell, I am doing my best! If you can capture some more equipment I might be able to rig up something that will do dozens at a time. 
RUSSELL: Well, now you're talking. 
(The sound of a SIDRAT materialising fills the room.) 
RUSSELL: One of those machines. Quick lads, in here! 
(Guards come out of the SIDRAT in Smythe's room and take out the soldiers. Then they advance into the main room where the rest of the resistance have turned their barricade to face the door. The Security Chief is behind them. The Doctor breaks cover to try and grab the processing machine.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: Stop! Take him! 
(A guard takes the Doctor into Smythe's room.) 
JAMIE: Don't shoot, you might hit the Doctor! 
(The Doctor is pushed into the SIDRAT followed the Security Chief carrying the machine, then the other guard. It dematerialises.)

Episode Eight

[SIDRAT landing bay]

(The SIDRAT materialises and a guard, the Security Chief carrying the machine, and the Doctor comes out to face a phalanx of armed guards.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you. 
(The Doctor is taken away.)

[Smythe's room]

CARSTAIRS: We should have been prepared for it. 
JAMIE: It's no good talking about what we should have done. Zoe, can you work that stuff and get another one of those things to arrive here? 
RUSSELL: Not on your life! You call one of those things, it'll be full of guards. They may have sent one anyway. 
CARSTAIRS: Sergeant? You got any explosives? 
RUSSELL: Lots of dynamite, sir. 
CARSTAIRS: Right, we'll put some here, where the thing lands. 
ZOE: But if you blow this place up, you'll destroy the time barrier equipment, and then their troops will be able to get in. 
RUSSELL: Yes, she's right. But we can keep the place guarded. You, get a machine gun and set it up in here. Right, come on. 
JAMIE: That's all very well, but it's not going to get the Doctor back, is it.

[War room]

SECURITY CHIEF: The prisoner is in the security room awaiting interrogation. 
WAR LORD: Good. A very successful venture. Congratulations. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Thank you. 
WAR LORD: Give it to the scientist. He will return to the home planet and have it mass produced. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Very well. 
(The Security Chief leaves with the mind-washing machine.) 
WAR CHIEF: The interrogation of that resistance leader might prove difficult. 
WAR LORD: Why? 
WAR CHIEF: He is obviously a man of substantial intellect. He will need special treatment. 
WAR LORD: Then you must see he gets it, mustn't you? 
WAR CHIEF: I will.

[Security section]

(The Security Chief is using his mind-reading machine on the Doctor.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: Answer me. You must answer. Admit that the War Chief sent you here. You are both of the same race. Your arrival here is part of a plot to betray us to the Time Lords. Answer! 
(The Doctor sits still so the Chief turns up the intensity.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: You will answer me now or I will destroy your mind totally!

[Smythe's room]

(Russell and two Americans set up a machine gun.) 
RUSSELL: Right, lads. Now see that this place is guarded at all times.

[British command post]

RUSSELL: Machine gun set up, sir. 
CARSTAIRS: Fine. 
JAMIE: Aye, maybe now you'll do something about getting the Doctor back? 
RUSSELL: I've got more than your friend the Doctor to worry about, lad. 
JAMIE: Now look, we can't just leave him, you know. 
RUSSELL: If there was any way of helping him, I would. 
ZOE: We must carry out the Doctor's plan, that's the best way we can help him. 
CARSTAIRS: How far did you two get to contacting the other resistance groups? 
RUSSELL: Not very far, sir. The attack on this place got in the way. 
CARSTAIRS: Yeah. 
ZOE: We sent out guards to contact the other resistance groups, the ones we couldn't reach. 
RUSSELL: Can you remember their names? 
ZOE: Yes. There's Marcus Octavius from the Roman Zone, Arturo Villar from the Mexican Civil War Zone, Ivan Petrov from the Crimean war Zone. 
RUSSELL: Yes. All right, all right, I believe you. 
ZOE: And I can remember all the locations of all their camps, too. 
RUSSELL: Arturo Villar. Now he's the one we've got to convince. 
JAMIE: Arturo Villar? Well, what's so special about him? 
RUSSELL: He's got one of the biggest resistance groups I know about. Bandits, most of them. 
(A SIDRAT is materialising.)

[Smythe's room]

RUSSELL: Right, lads. Now don't fire until the door opens. 
(The door opens and a guard comes out.) 
RUSSELL: Fire! 
(The machine gun is aimed directly at the opening, but the guard gets back in safely and the door closes.) 
RUSSELL: Hold it! 
(A door opens again and the gunners are felled by a weapon. Russell manages to get out of the way in time. Carstairs enters.) 
RUSSELL: Get back! 
(Russell takes the machine gun but Carstairs goes to the side of the SIDRAT and tosses a grenade in through the open door. BOOM. The SIDRAT dematerialises with smoke still curling from it.) 
RUSSELL: Well, they won't try that again in a hurry. 
CARSTAIRS: Soldier, get him out of here. Sergeant, get another machine gunner.

[British command post]

JAMIE: What happened? 
RUSSELL: It's all right, panic's over. Zoe, you'd better get a hurry with those resistance names, if you would. 
ZOE: Right. 
JAMIE: What're you going to do then? 
RUSSELL: We've got to round them all up. Get them here for a meeting. 
JAMIE: Oh, let's go then. 
RUSSELL: Not you, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
RUSSELL: Someone's got to be in charge here. 
JAMIE: Me? 
RUSSELL: Yes, lad. You.

[Security section]

(The interrogation is getting nowhere.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: Admit it, the War Chief sent for you. At this volume your mind will only last for fifteen minutes. Thirty if you are lucky. Now, admit that the War Chief sent for you! 
WAR CHIEF: Are you trying to kill him? 
(Security Chief turns off the probe and the Doctor relaxes.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: I am trying to get the truth out of him. 
WAR CHIEF: You'll never make him talk that way. 
SECURITY CHIEF: You are very sure. 
WAR CHIEF: He is one of my own race. Your truth machine cannot work on us if we choose to resist. 
SECURITY CHIEF: You admit it then. You do know him. 
WAR CHIEF: Of course I do. And only I can deal with him. Release him. 
SECURITY CHIEF: He is my prisoner. 
WAR CHIEF: But I am your superior. 
(The Security Chief releases the Doctor's wrists from the chair.) 
WAR CHIEF: You and I are going to talk alone. 
DOCTOR: I have nothing to say to you. 
WAR CHIEF: We shall see. Guards, take this prisoner to the War Room. 
(The Doctor is taken out.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: You have no right to interrupt my interrogation. 
WAR CHIEF: Your interrogation has been completely unsuccessful. I have methods of my own. 
(The War Chief leaves. The Security Chief goes over to his control desk.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: I want to speak to the War Lord on the top security channel.

[War room]

WAR CHIEF: See I am not interrupted. You also, outside. 
(All the technicians leave.) 
WAR CHIEF: You may have changed your appearance, but I know who you are. 
DOCTOR: Oh, do you? 
WAR CHIEF: Your machine is a Tardis. You're too familiar with it's controls to be a stranger. 
DOCTOR: I had every right to leave. 
WAR CHIEF: Stealing a Tardis? Oh, I'm not criticising you. We are two of a kind. 
DOCTOR: We most certainly are not! 
WAR CHIEF: We were both Time Lords and we both decided to leave our race. 
DOCTOR: I had reasons of my own. 
WAR CHIEF: Just as I had. 
DOCTOR: Your reasons are only too obvious. Power! 
WAR CHIEF: How much have you learnt of our plans? 
DOCTOR: I know that you've been kidnapping soldiers from the Earth from various times in it's history and bringing them here to kill one another. 
WAR CHIEF: But do you realise our ultimate objectives? 
DOCTOR: No objective can justify such slaughter. 
WAR CHIEF: The war games on this planet are simply the means to an end. The aliens intend to conquer the entire galaxy. A thousand inhabited worlds. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but why choose the people of the Earth? 
WAR CHIEF: They are the most suitable recruits for our armies. Man is the most vicious species of all. 
DOCTOR: Well, that simply isn't true. 
WAR CHIEF: Consider their history. For a half a million years they have been systematically killing each other. Now we can turn this savagery to some purpose. We can bring peace to the galaxy, and you can help. You see, I'm not the cold-hearted villain you suppose me to be. My motives are purely peaceful.

[British command post]

(Zoe has fallen asleep at the desk so Jamie puts a coat over her shoulders and leaves quietly. The armed guards are also dozing off. Then one gets hit over the head and the other has a rifle barrel pushed in his chest.) 
ZOE: Jamie? What? 
VILLAR: You don't speak, make a noise, understand? This man Russell, where is he? 
ZOE: Who are you? 
VILLAR: Arturo Villar! 
ZOE: Well, why didn't you tell us you were coming? 
VILLAR: Traps are for animals to fall into. Hey, get the men Russell, and no tricks. My men surround this place. 
ZOE: Well, I think you might at least have a 
VILLAR: Women should never think. For such a little woman your mouth is too big. Get Russell.

[Smythe's room]

(Jamie is asleep on the cot bed.) 
ZOE: Jamie? 
JAMIE: Has something happened? 
ZOE: I'll say it has. Arturo Villar's arrived with all his bandits, and they've surrounded the headquarters. 
JAMIE: Has he now? I'll soon sort him out. 
ZOE: Oh Jamie, no! They'd shoot you as soon as look at you. 
JAMIE: Eh? I thought he was supposed to be on our side? 
ZOE: Well, he is. Well, I mean, he will be if we can persuade him to join us. 
JAMIE: Well, didn't you explain to him? 
ZOE: Yes, I tried, but he wouldn't listen. He's got rather primitive ideas about women knowing their place. 
JAMIE: Has he now? Oh, sounds a nice chap. 
ZOE: Jamie, this is no laughing matter. We've got to persuade him to stay here until Russell gets back. 
JAMIE: Well look, if he won't listen to you, then he's not going to 
ZOE: No, not to me, but. Quickly over here, I've got an idea. 
JAMIE: Zoe, what are you doing? 
ZOE: Jamie, come on!

[British command post]

(Villar has helped himself to food.) 
VILLAR: Well? Where is this Russell? 
ZOE: He's not here. 
VILLAR: Then I go. 
ZOE: Wait! I think perhaps you'd better meet our other leader. 
VILLAR: Who is this? 
ZOE: Jamie! Our leader, James Robert McCrimmon! 
(Wearing an officer's cap and with two ammo belts across his chest, Jamie swaggers in.) 
VILLAR: Salut! 
JAMIE: Oh, how do you do. 
VILLAR: So, you call everyone together for a meeting, huh? Why? Maybe you plan to take over my territory, huh? 
JAMIE: Oh, no, no. No, it's nothing like that, no. 
ZOE: Unity is strength. 
JAMIE: Unity is strength. 
VILLAR: And when you have this strength, what do you do with it? 
JAMIE: Ah, do with it. Aye. 
ZOE: We attack the aliens that brought everybody here. 
JAMIE: We attack them all together in force! 
VILLAR: You bring all the resistance together in one place, you know what happens? We rob and kill each other! 
ZOE: You'll never win unless you work together. It's the only way. 
VILLAR: Why do you let a woman speak for you? 
JAMIE: Well, why not? Only if she's right, of course. 
ZOE: And I am. 
VILLAR: We always fight in small groups, far apart. That's why they don't catch us. 
JAMIE: Aye, and that's why you're getting nowhere. 
VILLAR: We are free men. We do anything we want to. 
ZOE: You are hunted fugitives and they'll pick you off one by one unless you join with us. It's the only way you'll ever get home. 
VILLAR: Home? No one can get away from this place. 
ZOE: Oh, but you can. 
VILLAR: How? 
ZOE: The same way you all came here. But first we've got to defeat the people that run everything. They have a stronghold. 
VILLAR: I have heard. It is impossible to get in there. 
ZOE: Well, we have been there, and if we can get a big enough army together, I can take you all there. 
VILLAR: All right, I stay for this meeting. But then we see.

[War room]

WAR CHIEF: We have soldiers from most of the major wars in the planet Earth. The first World War, the war between Russia and Japan of 1905, Thirty years war. 
DOCTOR: But why make them kill each other? 
WAR CHIEF: How else can we find the most disciplined and courageous fighters? 
DOCTOR: You have given these aliens our science and our knowledge to carry out this disgusting plan. 
WAR CHIEF: We are going to bring a new order to the galaxy, one United Galactic Empire. 
DOCTOR: An empire of slaves, with you as one of it's rulers. 
WAR CHIEF: Doctor, this is also a matter of your own survival. Unless I can convince the War Lord that you will help us 
(Alarms sound, the War Lord and Security Chief enter with guards.) 
WAR LORD: What is the prisoner doing here? 
WAR CHIEF: I am interrogating him. 
WAR LORD: You interrogate without guards? 
WAR CHIEF: I know this man. He is a fugitive from the Time Lords. 
SECURITY CHIEF: As you are. 
WAR CHIEF: That's right, as I am. 
WAR LORD: Did you bring him here? 
WAR CHIEF: No, he arrived by chance. 
WAR LORD: Did the Time Lords send you? 
DOCTOR: No. 
WAR LORD: Have you informed them? 
WAR CHIEF: He dare not. That would betray him. 
SECURITY CHIEF: He has allied himself with the resistance and has organised them against us. He must die. 
WAR CHIEF: No! He has agreed to help us destroy the resistance. He will cooperate. He has no alternative. 
SECURITY CHIEF: He should be killed now. We cannot trust him. 
WAR LORD: If he helps us destroy the resistance. If. His life will be spared. 
SECURITY CHIEF: War Lord. 
WAR CHIEF: I have decided. (to War Chief) I hold you responsible for the success of the plan. Failure will mean death, to both of you. 
(The War Lord, Security Chief and guards leave.) 
DOCTOR: I never promised to help you! 
WAR CHIEF: But you will. You have no alternative. 
DOCTOR: But to help people like that to conquer the galaxy? 
WAR CHIEF: Not people like that, people like us. I intend to take over as Supreme Galactic Ruler. You can help me to rule, if you will cooperate.

[British command post]

VILLAR: I tell you it's crazy, it'll never work! 
RUSSELL: We don't know till we've tried it. We've never had all the resistance groups together before. 
VILLAR: You bring everyone together in one place, you know what happens? The enemy will go pow! We are all killed. 
PETROV: What he says makes sense. Alone, we annoy them a little, together, we wipe them out. 
JAMIE: That's exactly what the Doctor says. 
CARSTAIRS: Look, we should get together a large body of men. Armed, disciplined. And then, and only then can we strike at their headquarters. 
VILLAR: How do we get there? 
ZOE: We use one of their own space time machines. 
VILLAR: Ah, these little boxes you talk about, holding thousands of men. Fairy stories! 
PETROV: I have seen one. I have seen soldiers come out of them. Whole regiments. 
CARSTAIRS: You see, Señor Villar? We're not talking nonsense. 
VILLAR: These magic boxes. Where do we get one? 
ZOE: They have certain landing points in each time zone. That room over there, that's one of them. 
VILLAR: How you get a whole army in here? The place is surrounded. It's hard enough for one man at a time to get in. 
CARSTAIRS: Yes, quite right. We must use one of the other places. 
JAMIE: Well, what about that American barn where we met Mister Russell? 
CARSTAIRS: Yes, that's er, that's here. (points to map) Is that all right for everybody? 
PETROV: Khorosho! I know that place. Much forest, easy to hide men. 
CARSTAIRS: Well, we're agreed then. You all gather your groups here, and we make a concerted attack on the enemy. 
VILLAR: And what if he make a concerted attack on us? 
CARSTAIRS: Oh, he's going to be far too busy to do that. 
(A motley pair of resistance fighters sneak into a Roman tent and smash its communications unit.)

[War room]

(Zone One alarm sounds.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: Failure of communications unit in Roman Zone. Send a technicians to repair. And send a guard!

[British command post]

CARSTAIRS: Right. Good. Right, carry on. That's the first one, Roman Zone. Control unit's been completely destroyed. 
ZOE: I wonder if it'll work? 
CARSTAIRS: Oh, it'll work all right. Next one's due in the Crimean War Zone. It's due about now. 
(The poor sentry gets jumped and dragged away while a Mexican takes dynamite into the store room. He comes out again unrolling the fuse wire which his Redcoat companion fastens to the detonator and then presses the plunger. KaBOOM!)

[War room]

SECURITY CHIEF: Another communications failure. Crimean War Zone. Send a squad of guards!

[British command post]

RUSSELL: (answers telephone.) Hello. Russell. 
CARSTAIRS: (on telephone) Good. Excellent. Yes, thank you very much. 
RUSSELL: I see. 
CARSTAIRS: Roman Zone. A technician and guard have arrived. 
ZOE: So that's the Roman Zone then. 
JAMIE: Technician and guard? That's only two men. 
CARSTAIRS: They're not really worried yet. 
RUSSELL: They are now. They've just sent a squad of guards to the Crimean War Zone. 
ZOE: Oh, good. That's a more like it. 
CARSTAIRS: By the time we've finished with them, there won't be a guard left in the place. 
(Time passes, and flags are put on the map for Russo-Japanese war and 30 years war. Zoe takes a call.) 
ZOE: Good! Jamie, Boer War Zone. 
CARSTAIRS: English Civil War Zone. 
RUSSELL: Yes, fine. Peninsular War Zone, they've sent ten guards there. 
CARSTAIRS: Right, well, that seems to be about it. Right, time for phase two. Villar should be at the barn by now. Carry on, Sergeant. 
RUSSELL: Sir. 
(Carstairs leaves.) 
RUSSELL: Okay, we'll leave one by one and spread out.

[Barn]

(A soldier rushes in and goes straight to the video screen. He gets shot. A Mexican draws his pistol to shoot out the screen.) 
VILLAR: No, not yet. Now we wait.

[War room]

SECURITY CHIEF: It is a clear pattern. Simultaneous attacks in all time zones. 
WAR CHIEF: And you've sent guards to every attack? 
SECURITY CHIEF: There are now very few left to send. 
WAR CHIEF: That's exactly what they wanted. Have any of the guards returned? 
SECURITY CHIEF: No. 
WAR CHIEF: So you've left the base weakened for a possible mass attack. 
WAR LORD: Is that true? 
SECURITY CHIEF: I know where their attack is coming from. A communications unit was activated in the American Civil War Zone. 
WAR LORD: And how do you propose to deal with them, with your guards scattered all over the War Zones? 
SECURITY CHIEF: The neutron bomb. 
WAR CHIEF: That would wipe out the processed humans. We would have to evacuate the planet. 
WAR LORD: The resistance army must be crushed once and for all. 
SECURITY CHIEF: So we shall use the neutron bomb? 
WAR LORD: No, we shall attempt to be rather more subtle than that, (to the Doctor) which will give you an ideal opportunity to prove your loyalty and save your life.

[Barn]

CARSTAIRS: Are all the resistance groups here, Sergeant? 
RUSSELL: Yes, sir. 
VILLAR: They are hidden in the woods. So here we all are in one place, a nice big target. 
RUSSELL: Don't worry, it won't be for long. Soon as we smash that thing, they'll send one of their machines and we'll take it. 
CARSTAIRS: Right, stand back. 
(Carstairs is about to shoot out the video screen when a familiar face appears on it.) 
JAMIE: Wait a minute! 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Jamie? Zoe? 
ZOE: Oh Doctor, where are you? Are you all right? 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Is Mister Russell there? 
JAMIE: Aye, all the resistance leaders are with us. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Oh, good. Now there's no time to be lost. I think I can send you one of their space time machines. I've managed to gain control of their transportation system. 
ZOE: We've got a whole army here, Doctor. We could take over the entire base. 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Oh, no, no. All I need is a party of picked men. There's got quite a lot to organise. I have to talk to the leaders. 
JAMIE: But Doctor, would it not be better if we brought a gang with us? 
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Jamie, please don't argue. I will send the transportation now. 
(Transmission ends.) 
VILLAR: I don't like this. It could be a trap. 
(A SIDRAT materialises.) 
CARSTAIRS: Don't panic! There's nothing to worry about. Everybody take cover just in case there are some guards. 
(The SIDRAT door opens and Carstairs checks inside.) 
CARSTAIRS: It's all right. It's empty. 
RUSSELL: Right, now one of us must stay here to look after those men. Petrov, it'd better be you. 
PETROV: All right, you are boss. 
VILLAR: Mine is the biggest group. I should stay here in charge. 
RUSSELL: Why? You scared of going into that thing? 
VILLAR: Arturo Villar is afraid of nothing! 
RUSSELL: Right. In you go then. 
VILLAR: I shall lead the way. (Carstairs, Villar, Zoe, Jamie, Russell enter the SIDRAT followed by Russell and a couple of soldiers. It dematerialises.)

[SIDRAT landing bay]

(The SIDRAT materialises.) 
DOCTOR: Ah, Carstairs. 
CARSTAIRS: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Zoe. 
ZOE: Oh, Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Jamie. 
JAMIE: Are you all right? 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, everything is under control. Now listen, everyone. Just follow me. We're going to take over the war room! 
(The Doctor leads them two paces into the room then guards appear.) 
DOCTOR: Stand still, don't move! You are completely surrounded! 
ZOE: Doctor! 
WAR CHIEF: Thank you, Doctor. A nice, neat little package for us to dispose of.

Episode Nine

[SIDRAT landing bay]

JAMIE: What's happened? 
RUSSELL: We were idiots to trust you. I'll kill you for this! 
WAR CHIEF: Idle threats, Doctor, have no fear. Guards, disarm them and take them away. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Take him too. 
WAR CHIEF: No. He is working for us. 
SECURITY CHIEF: What further use is he? 
WAR CHIEF: He has proved his loyalty by helping us, and he has great knowledge of time travel mechanics. 
SECURITY CHIEF: The War Lord shall decide. Take these prisoners to the processing room. Hold them there under strict guard until further orders. 
CARSTAIRS: Get off! 
(The prisoners are hustled away.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: I shall be with the War Lord. 
(Security Chief leaves.) 
WAR CHIEF: Don't worry, Doctor. The War Lord will welcome your loyalty and assistance. 
DOCTOR: Well, I hope so, but you know, I find it hard to understand why you need me. 
WAR CHIEF: We need each other. 
DOCTOR: It's something to do with the Tardis travel machines, isn't it? 
WAR CHIEF: Shall we join the War Lord? It doesn't do to keep him waiting. 
DOCTOR: I must congratulate you on them, you know. You're achieved a remarkable degree of control. 
WAR CHIEF: Simply a variation on the old models. 
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear fellow, you're too modest. Dimensional flexibility? Remote control? In my day these things were impossible to achieve without shortening the life of the time control units. 
WAR CHIEF: There have been many advances made in space time technology. 
DOCTOR: Yes, there must have been. That particular problem is impossible to solve. How did you solve it? 
WAR CHIEF: It's not a thing one can explain in a few words. We'll discuss it later. Now we really should join the War Lord. 
DOCTOR: You haven't solved it, have you? Your machines have a limited life span. Sooner or later they're going to be useless. 
WAR CHIEF: Very well. Yes, you're right. 
DOCTOR: Now I understand. It's my Tardis that you're after, isn't it? 
WAR CHIEF: Exactly! When we are in control, the machines I have brought with me will have expired. If we hold the only space time travel machine, we can rule our galaxy without fear of opposition. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but without me and my Tardis your ambitions are going to be rather hard to realise, aren't they? 
WAR CHIEF: That's right. And without my influence, these aliens will surely kill you.

[Processing room]

RUSSELL: Well, a fine mess your friend the Doctor got us in, eh? I'll break his neck when I get my hands on him. 
CARSTAIRS: Oh, I don't believe it. 
JAMIE: Look, he must have had a good reason. 
VILLAR: To have us killed, maybe, to save his own skin. When I get my hands on him I kill him too! 
JAMIE: Now look, the Doctor wouldn't betray us. 
ZOE: No, of course, he wouldn't! Why did he get us to come here?

[War room]

WAR LORD: He seems to have done very well. We have the leaders of the resistance, and the immediate threat to the war games is over. But your sudden decision to join us worries me. 
DOCTOR: Well, I like to be on the winning side. 
WAR LORD: Previously you thought the resistance to be the winning side. What made you change your mind? 
DOCTOR: Well, I hadn't realised how small and weak their groups were compared with your might and power. 
WAR LORD: You have a silver tongue, just like your friend the War Chief. What contribution can you make to our plan? 
DOCTOR: Well, your processing machines. I can make them work more effectively. 
WAR LORD: Our scientist is at this moment producing new machines on the home planet. 
DOCTOR: Ah yes, but that will take time. I can make the old ones work just as well. Probably better. 
WAR LORD: Very well. You shall have the opportunity to prove your ability. You will adjust the machines and reprocess your resistance friends. 
DOCTOR: They are no longer my friends. They are our enemies. 
WAR LORD: Of course they are. Take him to the processing room. See he has every facility. 
(The Doctor and Security Chief leave with guards.) 
WAR LORD: The resistance groups, where are they? 
WAR CHIEF: They are all now concentrated in this one area. I have ordered the conventional troops to move in on them. 
WAR LORD: Good. When the situation returns to normal order all the security guards to return to the control centre. All control points on the planet are to be repaired, and the war games recommenced. 
WAR CHIEF: Are you returning to the home planet? 
WAR LORD: No. I'm waiting until the emergency is over. You will inform me immediately if there's any change in the situation.

[Processing room]

ZOE: What are they making us wait here for? 
CARSTAIRS: Probably going to reprocess us again. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
CARSTAIRS: Brainwash us, send us back to fight. 
RUSSELL: No, I doubt it. They know their processing machines don't work on us. 
VILLAR: They will shoot us. What else do you do with prisoners? 
SECURITY CHIEF: Your friend the Doctor has a better idea. He is going to adjust the machines and re-process you himself. 
JAMIE: He wouldn't do that! 
ZOE: Doctor, you can't! 
RUSSELL: You just try it! 
SECURITY CHIEF: I don't think they like you. Unfortunately I cannot spare any of my guards to protect you, so you will have to fend for yourself. 
DOCTOR: What? But you 
(The Security Chief leaves with the guards.) 
RUSSELL: Well, well, well. It seems your new friends don't like you either. 
VILLAR: Leave him to me. I kill him first. 
DOCTOR: No. No! Don't come any closer, no!

[War room]

SECURITY CHIEF: How is the battle progressing? 
WAR CHIEF: The resistance group were all concentrated in this one area. We have them completely encircled. 
SECURITY CHIEF: And now you will destroy them? 
WAR CHIEF: Of course. They are falling into disorder, naturally enough since we have their leaders here. Has the Doctor started processing them? 
SECURITY CHIEF: Not yet. 
WAR CHIEF: Why not? 
SECURITY CHIEF: Where is the War Lord? 
WAR CHIEF: You did take the Doctor to the processing room? 
SECURITY CHIEF: Of course. 
WAR CHIEF: I don't trust you. 
SECURITY CHIEF: The feeling is mutual. 
(The War Chief leaves.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: Play back the recordings.

[Processing room]

(The Doctor is being mobbed.) 
DOCTOR: Oh no, leave me alone! 
CARSTAIRS: Leave him be! 
JAMIE: Now look! Just give him a chance to speak! 
RUSSELL: Yes, we listened to him once before and look where it got us. He led us into a trap! 
DOCTOR: They were going to drop a neutron bomb! You'd all be dead now, and all of your resistance friends with you, if it wasn't for me. 
VILLAR: He's lying. 
RUSSELL: You did a deal to save your own neck. 
VILLAR: But your deal didn't do you no good. They turn you over to us and now we kill you. 
CARSTAIRS: No, you can't just murder him. 
VILLAR: Is not murder, is execution. 
CARSTAIRS: Have you got any explanation for your conduct? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I am trying to save your lives! If you do exactly as I tell you'll be all right. 
VILLAR: We don't listen to your lies no more. 
(Villar gets away from Carstairs and starts choking the Doctor. The War Chief and his guards break it up.) 
WAR CHIEF: I'm sorry, Doctor. There seems to have been some kind of misunderstanding. 
DOCTOR: Yes, and it was very nearly fatal.

[War room]

WAR CHIEF [OC]: Doctor, this is also a matter of your own survival. Unless I can convince the War Lord that you will help us 
SECURITY CHIEF: Stop! Wind further on. Now! Try there. 
WAR LORD [OC]: Responsible for the success of the plan. Failure will mean death. For both of you. 
DOCTOR [OC]: I never promised to help you! 
WAR CHIEF [OC]: But you will. You have no alternative. 
DOCTOR [OC]: To help people like that gain control of the galaxy? 
WAR CHIEF [OC]: Not people like that, people like us. I will take over as Supreme Galactic Ruler. You can help me rule, if you will cooperate. 
SECURITY CHIEF: Enough! I knew it.

[Processing room]

(Jamie is in the brainwashing machine.) 
WAR CHIEF: Are you sure this new process will be completely effective? 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, quite sure. I think that will do. There we are. Now then, when this young man comes to, he will believe himself to be fighting the English Redcoats in 1745. Now get up! 
JAMIE: Eh? Oh. 
DOCTOR: What is your name? 
JAMIE: Eh? 
DOCTOR: Your name. 
JAMIE: Ah, James Robert McCrimmon. 
DOCTOR: Do you know where you are? 
JAMIE: Er well, I 
DOCTOR: You are in my castle. I am the McCrimmon of McCrimmon, your hereditary Chieftain. 
JAMIE: Yes, of course. You're the Chieftain. Who's that? 
DOCTOR: Well, that is a friendly chieftain. You will obey his orders as you will mine. 
JAMIE: Oh aye, I'll obey you. 
DOCTOR: There you are, you see? Complete loyalty and devotion. I can do the same with all the other resistance people that you capture. 
WAR CHIEF: Excellent. Continue with the others. If you can successfully process characters like these, you will have made an immense contribution. 
(The War Chief leaves.) 
DOCTOR: Thank you. Bring the girl! 
ZOE: Oh, leave me alone. Don't! 
(The guards bring Zoe, and Jamie helps sit her down.) 
JAMIE: Look, do as you're told. 
DOCTOR: You will obey us. It is for your own good. (wink)

[War room]

WAR CHIEF: What a stupid fool you are. You deliberately disobeyed the War Lord's orders. Arrest him. Arrest him! 
SECURITY CHIEF: You are no longer in command. 
WAR CHIEF [OC]: I will take over as Supreme Galactic Ruler. You can help me rule, if you will cooperate. 
SECURITY CHIEF: I had all discussion that took place between you and the Doctor recorded. What a stupid fool you are. Guards, take him to the security bay! Collect his accomplice, the Doctor, on the way. If they offer any resistance, shoot them both!

[Processing room]

(Villar has been processed.) 
DOCTOR: There we are. Now then, sit up, sit up! Now then, you are in la Castille de la Cruz de San Antonio de la Frada Forma, in Mexico. 
VILLAR: Eh? Are you crazy? You machine is no good! Villar is too strong for you! 
(Villar starts throttling the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: Stop! Get him off me! 
(Carstairs and the others tackle the guards who come to his aid, then Jamie gets Villar off the Doctor.) 
JAMIE: Can you not pretend like the rest of us, you great loon? 
VILLAR: Is all a trick? 
JAMIE: Aye. 
VILLAR: You fix the machine so she don't work? 
DOCTOR: Yes. I fix her, and you nearly fixed me. 
VILLAR: And you only pretend to be loco? 
JAMIE: Exactly! 
RUSSELL: But Doctor, why did you get us here at all? 
DOCTOR: They were going to drop the neutron bomb. You were better alive here than dead out there. 
CARSTAIRS: Zoe, watch the door, will you? 
ZOE: Right. 
CARSTAIRS: Doctor, now we're here, surely we can take over? 
RUSSELL: It depends upon how many of those guards they've got. 
CARSTAIRS: Ah, but we've been drawing them out to the Time Zones. 
DOCTOR: Yes, very successfully from what I hear. 
ZOE: Doctor, somebody's coming. Three of them are heading this way. 
(The War Chief is marched in under guard. The fighters take out the guards.) 
DOCTOR: Don't harm him. We may need him. 
WAR CHIEF: It seems my trust in you was a little misplaced. 
DOCTOR: Did you really think I'd take part in your disgusting, stealing scheme? 
WAR CHIEF: Why not? You must have been a little tempted by the thought of being the ruler of an entire galaxy. 
VILLAR: All this talk! When we fight? 
RUSSELL: We haven't got anything to fight with. We've no guns. 
CARSTAIRS: We've got those alien guns if we can work out how to use them. 
VILLAR: I no trust those things. I need my guns, they good guns, never miss. 
RUSSELL: Well, he knows where they're stored. 
WAR CHIEF: I might. 
RUSSELL: You'd better, because I'm 
DOCTOR: I'm sure that the War Chief is going to cooperate. He's going to help us gain control of the War Room. 
WAR CHIEF: That may not be so easy. You see, our little arrangement had been discovered. I was under arrest. 
RUSSELL: Oh yes? 
CARSTAIRS: Yes, that could be right. He did come in here under gunpoint. 
WAR CHIEF: But the personnel in the landing bay are not aware of my arrest. When the security guards return from the Time Zones, you won't stand a chance. I can stop the arrival of the time machines. 
DOCTOR: I see. Very well, but first you'll take us to the War Room. You're the only one that can stop the fighting in the Zones. 
VILLAR: Hey, wait a minute! First we get our guns, no? 
DOCTOR: No. I mean, yes. Come along, Jamie, Zoe.

[War room]

SECURITY CHIEF: I want a blanket broadcast to all security guards in the War Zones. This is the Security Chief. The resistance groups are scattered over the Civil War Zone. They will be dealt with later. All security guards will now proceed to the nearest control point, there are 
(The resistance rushes in.) 
SECURITY CHIEF: Guards! 
(Two more guards enter, and Villar shoots them.) 
VILLAR: I told you, my guns best! 
SECURITY CHIEF: Emergency alarm! 
(The technician hits the alarm then gets shot. The Security Chief tries to sneak to a weapons rack, and the War Chief takes him down with one of the sonic weapons. Jamie and Carstairs point their guns at him.) 
WAR CHIEF: It's all right. It was a personal debt I had to settle. 
(The War Chief hands over the weapon.) 
DOCTOR: Will somebody turn off that hideous noise? I cannot think! 
ZOE: There's one thing I don't understand, Doctor. How are you going to get all these people back to their own time? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I've been thinking about that. 
WAR CHIEF: You realise that we have very little time now the alarm has been sounded? 
DOCTOR: Yes. Call off the fighting at once! 
WAR CHIEF: We could just go to the landing bay, order a machine and leave. 
DOCTOR: You could, we can't. The fighting has to be stopped and everyone sent back to their own times. 
WAR CHIEF: Sent back? How? 
DOCTOR: By your Tardis travel machines, of course. 
WAR CHIEF: I'm afraid that will not be possible. There are only two machines left with enough life in them. 
DOCTOR: What? But, oh my word, well that's happened rather sooner than I expected. 
RUSSELL: Doctor, does that mean that you can't do as you promised and get us all home? 
DOCTOR: Oh, well, yes, I 
WAR CHIEF: You can't. 
DOCTOR: I can still do that. 
WAR CHIEF: You can't, unless. Doctor, you mustn't call them in or it will be the end of us. They'll show no mercy. 
DOCTOR: You stop the fighting! 
RUSSELL: Do as you're told! 
WAR CHIEF: This is the War Chief to all War Zones. This is a command direct from the War Lord. All fighting will cease. I repeat, all fighting in the War Zones will cease. You will stand by for further orders. 
ZOE: What did he mean, Doctor? Who mustn't you call? 
DOCTOR: The only people who can put an end to this whole ghastly business and send everyone back to their own times. The Time Lords. 
JAMIE: Who are they? 
DOCTOR: They're my own people, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Oh, well, that's all right, then. 
ZOE: But it isn't all right, is it, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: No, it's not, Zoe. But I'm afraid that there's no alternative. 
(The Doctor sits on the floor and puts six plastic squares in a circle in front of him. Then he closes his eyes and concentrates.) 
JAMIE: What's he doing? 
WAR CHIEF: Don't do it, Doctor. You can't! You know what will happen! 
(The squares form themselves into a cube.) 
JAMIE: Look at that! 
CARSTAIRS: That's fantastic. 
VILLAR: Is magic! 
ZOE: Doctor, are you all right? 
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoe, I'm all right. 
JAMIE: Doctor, what's that? 
DOCTOR: It's a box, Jamie. 
JAMIE: I know. I can see that. 
DOCTOR: It's a very special sort of box. It now contains all the information about what's been going on here, and an appeal for help. 
JAMIE: Help? Who from? 
ZOE: The Time Lords? 
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoe. 
JAMIE: Well, why haven't you asked them for help before? 
DOCTOR: I've never really needed it before, Jamie, but this business of sending everyone back to their own times is, well, it's too difficult for me. 
(The Doctor puts the cube in his pocket.) 
DOCTOR: Now, come along. The War Chief! 
CARSTAIRS: What? 
DOCTOR: He's gone! 
RUSSELL: What? 
DOCTOR: He must be trying to get away before the Time Lords get here! 
CARSTAIRS: Well, what are we going to do, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: We must go to the landing bay and stop him.

[SIDRAT landing bay]

(The War Chief runs in and summons a SIDRAT. But before he can get inside he is stopped by guards.) 
WAR CHIEF: I thought 
WAR LORD: Yes? 
WAR CHIEF: You've arrived just in time. There's been a revolt. The prisoners have escaped. How many guards do you have? 
WAR LORD: Only the ones you see here. 
WAR CHIEF: Then we must return to the home planet to bring reinforcements. 
WAR LORD: Where is the Security Chief? 
WAR CHIEF: The prisoners have taken over the War Room. They've killed him. 
WAR LORD: No, no, you killed him, but a little too late. I heard the recording. 
WAR CHIEF: He wanted to stop the War Games. He was a incompetent fool, jealous of my position. Surely you realise that? He forged that recording you heard. 
(The War Chief runs for the exit but guards block him.) 
WAR CHIEF: He wanted to stop the war games! He tried 
WAR LORD: Kill him!

[Central area]

(The War Chief's screams can be heard.) 
CARSTAIRS: Doctor! Doctor, that came from the landing bay! 
DOCTOR: Yes, but they won't be expecting us. Come on.

[SIDRAT landing bay]

WAR LORD: Remove the traitor's carcass. We will return to the home planet and bring back an army to quell this revolt once and for all. 
(The guards take the War Chief's body to one side while the War Lord adjusts the SIDRAT control panel.) 
VILLAR: Viva el Villar! 
(Villar starts shooting, and the other fighters join in from the other side of the bay. Jamie goes hand to hand with a remaining guard.) 
VILLAR: Out of the way, I shoot the dog! 
(Carstairs deals with the other surviving guard as Russell helps Jamie. Villar goes to the War Lord.) 
VILLAR: I kill him too! 
DOCTOR: No, no, that won't be necessary. We'll leave him for the Time Lords to dispose of. 
RUSSELL: When will they be here, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I'm going to send for them now. And I want you all to stay here and wait until they come. 
RUSSELL: But what are you going to do? 
DOCTOR: Well, I cannot stay here. Jamie, Zoe, this is where we say goodbye. 
JAMIE: What are you talking about? 
DOCTOR: Well, the Time Lords will return you home. 
ZOE: But why can't we stay with you? 
DOCTOR: Because when I send this box to them, they'll know where I am. 
JAMIE: But I thought they were your people, your friends? 
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, they are my people, but. Oh, it'd take too long to explain. I have to go! 
JAMIE: Now look, if you're going to be in trouble, you'll need me to look after you. 
ZOE: Me, too. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
DOCTOR: But you don't understand! Oh, very well, but don't say I didn't warn you. Right then, we must return to the 1917 Zone and find the Tardis, and make good our escape. 
CARSTAIRS: Doctor, can I come back there with you? I'd rather like to try and find Lady Jennifer. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, very well. 
(The Doctor gets a SIDRAT ready, then sits on the floor and concentrates. The box vanishes.) 
DOCTOR: Well, goodbye, gentlemen. I'm sorry, but we must rush. 
VILLAR: You leave us? 
RUSSELL: Yes, what about us? 
DOCTOR: The Time Lords will return you home. Now come along. 
VILLAR: No! No one is going anywhere. This Doctor, he cheat us. We rescue him and now he leave us here to die. 
RUSSELL: Yes, it's only fair, Doctor! If these Time Lords are friends of yours, why don't you wait for them to arrive? 
DOCTOR: But you don't understand, Mister Russell. I must go. Please! 
VILLAR: You stay here with us, my friend. 
DOCTOR: Look, I am not going to argue. Jamie, Zoe, Carstairs, into the machine. 
JAMIE: Ah but Doctor, look, he's not joking, you know. 
DOCTOR: For once, Jamie, do as you are told! 
VILLAR: You move and I kill you! 
DOCTOR: Then you will just have to kill me, Mister Villar. 
VILLAR: Well Mister Doctor, that is just what I will do! 
(The Doctor goes into the SIDRAT after Jamie and Zoe. Carstairs and Russell grab Villar to stop him shooting the Doctor, then Carstairs enters the SIDRAT.) 
VILLAR: Let me go, I kill him! 
RUSSELL: You can't shoot him in the back, he's done too much for us. 
VILLAR: Ah, the back, the front, what's the difference? 
RUSSELL: It's too late now, anyway. 
(The SIDRAT dematerialises.) 
WAR LORD: Don't worry. When the Time Lords get him, he'll wish you had killed him. 
(A strange sound fills the room.) 
WAR LORD: They're coming.

[No Man's Land]

CARSTAIRS: Fighting's stopped. 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, goodbye, Lieutenant. 
JAMIE: Eh? 
DOCTOR: There's the Tardis. We've got to get on. 
CARSTAIRS: Goodbye, Doctor. 
ZOE: Oh, Doctor, wait! Goodbye! 
JAMIE: Bye, Lieutenant. 
CARSTAIRS: Bye. 
(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie rush away, and Carstairs waves then vanishes.) 
JAMIE: Hey, he's 
DOCTOR: Come on! 
(The strange sound is here too. Their movements get slower and slower as they run towards the Tardis.) 
DOCTOR: Come on! 
ZOE: What is it? 
DOCTOR: Time Lords! Try harder! We must get away! 
(They are on hands and knees by the time they get to the Tardis.) 
DOCTOR: We must get away! 
(The Doctor just manages to put the key in the lock.)

Episode Ten

[Outside the Tardis]

ZOE: What's happening, Doctor? I can hardly move. 
DOCTOR: It's a force field. Concentrate. We may be able to break through it. Help me with the key. Concentrate! 
(Jamie holds the Doctor's arm up to turn the key and open the Tardis door.)

[Tardis]

(They crawl inside.) 
ZOE: It's in here, too. 
JAMIE: Will we get away all right, Doctor? 
(The Doctor reaches the door controls.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, I hope so, Jamie. If I can boost the power enough, the Tardis may be able to break through the force field. 
(The Tardis dematerialises and they can move at normal speed again.) 
JAMIE: Well, what was happening? Why was it so difficult to move? 
DOCTOR: It was the Time Lords. 
ZOE: But they're your own people, aren't they, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. 
JAMIE: Why did you run away from them in the first place? 
DOCTOR: What? Well, I was bored. 
ZOE: What do you mean, you were bored? 
DOCTOR: Well, the Time Lords are an immensely civilised race. We can control our own environment, we can live forever, barring accidents, and we have the secret of space time travel. 
JAMIE: Well what's so wrong in all that? 
DOCTOR: Well we hardly ever use our great powers. We consent simply to observe and to gather knowledge. 
ZOE: And that wasn't enough for you? 
DOCTOR: No, of course not. With a whole galaxy to explore? Millions of planets, eons of time, countless civilisations to meet? 
JAMIE: Well, why do they object to you doing all that? 
DOCTOR: Well, It is a fact, Jamie, that I do tend to get involved with things. 
JAMIE: Aye, you can say that again. Whenever there's any trouble, he's in it right up to his neck. 
ZOE: But you've helped people, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, but that's no excuse in their eyes. 
JAMIE: Well, then what are you going to do? 
DOCTOR: We're going to run away. I've set the controls to take us to a planet on the outermost fringes of the galaxy. 
JAMIE: Oh, in that case, we'll probably land up right in their laps. 
(The Tardis dematerialises.) 
ZOE: We can't be landing already. 
DOCTOR: Well, that is impossible! 
(The TARDIS is dropping through the air to a sea, where it lands with a gentle plop.) 
JAMIE: Oh, it's the sea. 
ZOE: Well, don't worry, Jamie. We know the Tardis can't sink. 
JAMIE: Oh, can't it? Look! 
(The scanner is looking straight at a coral reef.) 
ZOE: Oh, now what can we do? 
(A shark swims by.) 
JAMIE: Look out! 
DOCTOR: It's all right. It can't possibly harm us. 
(A type of materialisation noise sounds and the Tardis shakes.) 
JAMIE: I'm not so sure! 
DOCTOR: We're perfectly safe in the Tardis. 
ZOE: Doctor! 
(Water is dripping onto the console.) 
DOCTOR: Oh my word! It's the Time Lords. They're breaking down the defensive mechanism. We've got to get out of here. 
ZOE: Where can we go? 
DOCTOR: Well, I know one place where we'll be safe, if I can get us there. 
(The Doctor relocates the Tardis.) 
JAMIE: Where are we? 
DOCTOR: We're in outer space. We'll just stop here for a while. There's a chance we may have given them the slip. 
(A gentle, reasonable voice fills the Tardis.) 
TIME LORD [OC]: There is no escape, Doctor. Return the Tardis immediately to our home planet. 
DOCTOR: Why can't you leave me alone? I haven't done any harm. 
TIME LORD [OC]: You have broken our laws. You must face your trial. 
JAMIE: Trial? 
TIME LORD [OC]: You will do better to return of your own accord. 
DOCTOR: Oh, oh, oh, very well, if I must. 
ZOE: Doctor, what on Earth are you doing? 
DOCTOR: I'm trying to make a quick transference jump. We've got to get away from here to somewhere safe. Ah, we're landing. 
(The scanner shows alligators.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, no! 
JAMIE: Is that what you call somewhere safe? 
(The trio are thrown to the floor.) 
ZOE: Oh! It's shaking itself to pieces! 
JAMIE: Yeah, we could all be killed! 
ZOE: Doctor, can't you induce a power drive? 
DOCTOR: I'll try. Oh, the controls. They're moving by themselves. 
(Everything settles down again.) 
JAMIE: Now where are we? 
ZOE: Oh, let's see on the scanner. 
JAMIE: Oh, it's broken. 
ZOE: No, I don't think so. 
(Suddenly the picture resolves itself into a long chamber filled with SIDRATS along one wall.) 
TIME LORD [OC]: You have returned to us, Doctor. Your travels are over. 
DOCTOR: It's my own planet. They have brought us here. 
JAMIE: Can't we get away again? 
DOCTOR: No, not this time. Come along.

[SIDRAT bay]

(A man in a long robe is waiting for them.) 
TIME LORD 2: Come with me. 
JAMIE: Now, just a moment. What's going on around here? 
DOCTOR: Jamie, do as he says.

[Trial chamber]

(They are led in. The War Lord is already there. The Time Lord joins two others.) 
TIME LORD 2: The witnesses have arrived. 
TIME LORD: Let them stand aside until they are needed. Continue with the trial. 
(Yes, that mellifluous voice is Bernard Horsfall again.) 
TIME LORD 3: In every one of these time zones, thousands of human beings fought and died in the belief that they were on their own planet. The survivors have now all been returned to their own times on the planet Earth, but the death roll is beyond counting. These lives were squandered in the course of a vicious and diabolical scheme to gain control of the entire galaxy. A scheme originated and devised by a race of which the accused is the leader. It was a was a highly organised scheme with an utterly callous disregard for the lives of the humans involved and for the liberties of all the other species in the galaxy which the accused would have dominated with his tyranny. In the pursuit of this scheme, brutal methods of mental processing were used which entirely contravened all the galactic laws. I will now call upon a member of our own race to sort this evil matter out. There will commence a reading of the witness' report. The witness is called. Will you step forward, please? 
(Over the above statement, the Doctor is explaining.) 
DOCTOR: The Time Lords holding a trial is a very rare event. 
ZOE: Why? 
DOCTOR: Well, normally they don't interfere with the affairs of other planets, but they had to when I called for help. 
JAMIE: Well, look, can't we get away? 
DOCTOR: Well, you and Zoe may, but I don't think I will. 
TIME LORD 3: Will you step forward, please? 
DOCTOR: Oh, oh, I beg your pardon. 
TIME LORD 3: We have received your statement. Do you swear to the truth of your report? 
DOCTOR: Everything in that report is the result of my direct personal observation. 
TIME LORD 3: Who is that person? 
DOCTOR: That is the War Lord. 
TIME LORD 3: Does the accused have anything to say? 
TIME LORD: You must speak in your defence. 
TIME LORD 2: The trial cannot proceed unless you do. 
TIME LORD 3: You must speak. 
DOCTOR: Can't you see he's just playing for time? 
TIME LORD 3: Do not make us force you to speak. We would not cause you unnecessary pain. Very well. 
(The Time Lord widens his eyes and suddenly the War Lord falls to his knees screaming and clutching his head.) 
WAR LORD: Stop it! Stop the light! 
TIME LORD 3: You must speak. 
WAR LORD: Yes. 
TIME LORD 3: Do you admit the charges with which you have been accused? 
WAR LORD: I do not even admit the authority of this court. 
TIME LORD: Have you anything to say in your defence? 
WAR LORD: The humans who died in our war games would have killed each other anyway. 
TIME LORD 2: Is your plea that that ends justifies the means? 
WAR LORD: Yes, it is. And members of your own race agreed with me. My War Chief was himself was a Time Lord, and the knowledge he brought me made the whole scheme possible. And another of your Time Lords gave me his support! 
DOCTOR: I never supported your scheme for one moment. 
WAR LORD: You collaborated with my War Chief. If I am guilty, then you are guilty too! 
(Meanwhile, two men are inside the Tardis, working on the console. One goes out to investigate the sound of materialisation and is gunned down by two of the War Lord's guards. The second then comes out and is also killed. Then a total of six guards move off.) 
TIME LORD: We find you guilty of all charges against you. Your attempt to incriminate others is an obvious fraud. 
DOCTOR: Oh, good. I'm glad to see your sense of justice still prevails. (sotto) Even though they've lost their sense of humour. 
WAR LORD: You have no authority over me. 
(The guards enter.) 
WAR LORD: And no power any longer to pass any sentence. Take these people. 
DOCTOR: Oh, no! 
JAMIE: Not again. 
(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie are hustled out.) 
WAR LORD: And if any attempt is made to stop us, then I shall kill them instantly. 
TIME LORD: Let them go. We shall not endanger innocent lives.

[SIDRAT bay]

DOCTOR: You'll never get away. The Time Lords are too strong for you. You needn't think I'm going to help you. 
WAR LORD: Oh yes, you will help us, Doctor, if you want to save the lives of your two friends. Now, into the machine. 
JAMIE: Look, the Tardis is no good to you. He can't even steer it properly. 
WAR LORD: Don't talk rubbish. Of course he can steer it. Now, into the machine!

[Tardis]

WAR LORD: Yes, you shall make us many of these machines. Now, get to the control panel and take us back to the home planet. 
DOCTOR: I can't, I tell you. The directional mechanism is faulty. 
WAR LORD: You will do as I say or we shall kill the girl. 
DOCTOR: But I don't even know where your home planet is. 
WAR LORD: Galactic sector nine seven three, then we will get the homing signal. Now operate the machine! 
DOCTOR: I'll do my best, but I can't promise anything. Jamie, Zoe, hide your eyes. Run! 
(The Tardis lights are blinding.) 
WAR LORD: Get after them! Kill them! Quickly!

[SIDRAT bay]

(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe run over to the Time Lords.) 
WAR LORD: Kill them! 
(But a forcefield stops the guards.) 
TIME LORD 3: A force field has been placed around you, and around your planet, so that your warlike people will remain prisoners forever. You have been found guilty of all charges, and you and your murderous associates will be dematerialised. It will be as though you had never existed. 
WAR LORD: No, no, no, no! 
(The War Lord and the guards vanish.) 
JAMIE: Ah, well, that's put an end to them. Well, we'll be on our way. Come on, Doctor. Cheerio. 
(Jamie strolls over to the Tardis and straight into the forcefield which then envelopes him and Zoe.) 
JAMIE: Oh, switch this thing off. 
DOCTOR: Jamie, they are not going to let us go. 
JAMIE: What? After all you've done for them? 
(The Doctor and two Time Lords leave.) 
ZOE: What are you going to do to him? 
TIME LORD 3: He must stand his trial. You will wait here. 
ZOE: Well, we want to go with the Doctor! Oh, let us out! 
JAMIE: Come on, let us out of this thing!

[Trial chamber]

TIME LORD: You have heard the charge against you, that you have repeatedly broken our most important law of non-interference in the affairs of other planets. What have you to say? Do you admit these actions? 
DOCTOR: I not only admit them, I am proud of them. While you have been content merely to observe the evil in the galaxy, I have been fighting against it. 
TIME LORD 3: It is not we who is on trial here, Doctor, it is you. 
DOCTOR: No, no, of course, you're above criticism, aren't you. 
TIME LORD: Do you admit that these actions were justified? 
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, I do. Give me a thought channel and I'll show you some of the evils I've been fighting against. 
(The Time Lords nod to each other.) 
DOCTOR: The Quarks, deadly robot servants of the cruel Dominators, they tried to enslave a peace loving race. Then there were the Yeti, more robot killers, instruments of an alien intelligence trying to take over the planet Earth. 
TIME LORD 3: All this is entirely irrelevant. 
DOCTOR: You asked me to justify my actions, I am doing so. Let me show you the Ice Warriors, cruel Martian invaders, they tried to conquer the Earth too. So did the Cybermen, half creature, half machine. But worst of all were the Daleks, a pitiless race of conquerors exterminating all who came up against them. All these evils I have fought while you have done nothing but observe. True, I am guilty of interference, just as you are guilty of failing to use your great powers to help those in need! 
TIME LORD: Is that all you have to say? 
DOCTOR: Well, isn't it enough? 
TIME LORD: Your defence has been heard and will be carefully considered, but you have raised difficult issues. We require time to think about them. You will be recalled when we have made our decision.

[SIDRAT bay]

JAMIE: Let us out! 
ZOE: We want to see the Doctor. Let us out of here! 
(The force field is turned off.) 
TIME LORD 2: Follow me. 
ZOE: Where are we going? 
TIME LORD 2: We're going to send you home. Back you your own world and your own time. 
JAMIE: Oh no, not without the Doctor. 
TIME LORD 2: This is his world. He must stay here. 
ZOE: Well, what's going to happen to him? 
TIME LORD 2: He is awaiting the result of his trial. 
JAMIE: Aye, well, I'm not going till I see him. 
ZOE: Oh, please, can't we see the Doctor? 
TIME LORD 2: You have become attached to him? 
JAMIE: Aye, we've been through a lot, you know. 
ZOE: Please let us see him. 
TIME LORD 2: Come with me. 
JAMIE: Aye.

[Trial chamber]

(The Doctor is reclining on the floor, playing clock patience.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie! Zoe! 
ZOE: Doctor! 
(They are stopped by a forcefield.) 
TIME LORD 2: I've brought your friends to say goodbye. 
JAMIE: Oh, switch this thing off. 
ZOE: We can't say goodbye through a forcefield. 
TIME LORD 2: Very well. I shall leave you together. for a little while. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. 
(The forcefield disappears and the Time Lord leaves.) 
DOCTOR: Jamie! Zoe! 
ZOE: Doctor! 
JAMIE: What are they going to do to you? 
DOCTOR: Oh, nothing much. I expect they'll to make me listen to a long boring speech about being a good boy. They like making speeches. 
ZOE: Well, I think it's time you left them again. 
DOCTOR: Well, that's easier said than done. 
JAMIE: Oh come on, we've been in tighter situations than this. 
DOCTOR: Well, you don't know the Time Lords, Jamie. I do. 
ZOE: Oh, you're not just going to give up, are you, Doctor? 
JAMIE: Of course he's not. Are you, Doctor, eh? 
DOCTOR: Well. Oh, all right, but we may find it a bit difficult getting out of here. 
JAMIE: Hey, they've forgotten to switch that thing back on again. 
DOCTOR: Forgotten? 
ZOE: Well, that's all we need, isn't it? Now we can get away. 
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course. 
JAMIE: Come on! 
(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe pick their way through an area of square pools of mist to )

[SIDRAT bay]

TIME LORD 3: There is no escape, Doctor. 
(Jamie runs up against a forcefield.) 
TIME LORD 3: It is time to say goodbye to your friends. 
ZOE: There must be something we can do? 
DOCTOR: No Zoe, not this time. Well, goodbye, Jamie. 
JAMIE: But Doctor surely we could 
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Jamie. 
JAMIE: I won't forget you, you know. 
DOCTOR: I won't forget you. Don't go blundering into too much trouble, will you? 
JAMIE: Oh, you're a fine one to talk. 
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Zoe. 
ZOE: Goodbye, Doctor. Will we ever meet again? 
DOCTOR: Again? Now, Zoe, you and I know, time is relative, isn't it? 
(Jamie and Zoe are led to a SIDRAT. They wave and go inside. It dematerialises.) 
DOCTOR: They'll forget me, won't they? 
TIME LORD 2: Not entirely. They will be returned to a time just before they went away with you. They will remember their first adventure with you, but nothing more. But come along. Your fate has been decided.

[The Wheel in Space]

(The Doctor watches on the trial chamber viewscreen as a confused Zoe walks down a corridor.) 
TANYA: Oh, Zoe. Zoe, are you all right? 
ZOE: Oh, yes. 
TANYA: Are the Doctor and Jamie gone? 
ZOE: Yes, I've just seen them off. 
TANYA: Well, we'd better get back to work, you know. There's a lot to be done if we're going to get the Wheel back to normal. Are you sure you're all right? 
ZOE: Oh, yes. I thought I'd forgotten something important, but it's nothing. 
TANYA: Right, come along then. 
ZOE: All right, I'm coming.

[Trial chamber]

(On the screen, Zoe looks back then the image fades.) 
DOCTOR: She'll be all right, won't she? 
TIME LORD: Of course. 
DOCTOR: What about Jamie? 
TIME LORD 3: Look.

[Culloden Moor]

(Pipes are skirling as a Redcoat aims his musket at Jamie's back. He turns and drops just as the soldier fires.) 
JAMIE: Try to murder a McCrimmon, would you? Well, I'll show you! Creag an Tuire! 
(Jamie charges the Redcoat, swinging his sword while the man tries to reload. He gives up and flees.)

[Trial chamber]

TIME LORD: They will both continue their lives as if nothing had happened. 
DOCTOR: Yes, very efficient. Now then, what about me? 
TIME LORD: We have accepted your plea that there is evil in the universe that must be fought, and that you still have a part to play in that battle. 
DOCTOR: What? You mean that you're going to let me go free? 
TIME LORD: Not entirely. We have noted your particular interest in the planet Earth. The frequency of your visits must have given you special knowledge of that world and it's problems. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose that's true. Earth seems more vulnerable than others, yes. 
TIME LORD: For that reason you will be sent back to that planet. 
DOCTOR: Oh, good. 
TIME LORD: In exile. 
DOCTOR: In exile? 
TIME LORD: You will be sent to Earth in the twentieth century, and will remain there for as long as we deem proper, and for that period the secret of the Tardis will be taken from you. 
DOCTOR: But you, you can't condemn me to exile on one primitive planet in one century in time! Besides, I'm known on the Earth. It might be very awkward for me. 
TIME LORD: Your appearance has changed before, it will change again. That is part of the sentence. 
DOCTOR: You can't just change what I look like without consulting me! 
TIME LORD: You will have an opportunity to choose your appearance. 
DOCTOR: Oh, well, that's not so bad. But I warn you, I'm very particular. 
TIME LORD: Here is your first choice. 
(A man with a big bushy beard, followed by other sketches.) 
DOCTOR: Oh he's too old! Well he's too fat, isn't he. No, he's too thin. That one's too young. Oh now, that won't do at all. It's ridiculous. 
TIME LORD: You're wasting time, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: It's not my fault, is it? Is this the best you can do? I've never seen such an incredible bunch. 
TIME LORD: Since you refuse to take the decision, the decision will be taken for you. 
DOCTOR: No, no, no, I never said that. But I maintain I have the right to decide what I look like! It could be very important on the Earth. People on Earth attach a very great deal of importance 
(The Doctor's face is beginning to twist and change.) 
DOCTOR: Ah, what's happening? 
(We are treated to multiple images of Patrick gurning as they circle around.) 
DOCTOR: What's hap, what's happened? 
TIME LORD: The time has come for you to change your appearance, Doctor, and begin your exile. 
DOCTOR: Is this some sort of joke? No, I refuse to be treated in. What are you doing? 
(The Doctor's face disappears.) 
DOCTOR: No! Stop, you're making me giddy! No, you can't do this to me! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

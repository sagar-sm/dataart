[Tardis]
(The Doctor has regenerated after his ordeal with the Cybermen and energy-draining Mondas. Ben and Polly watched him change into a younger person.)  POLLY: His face, his hair, look at it.  BEN: He's breathing, and the Tardis seems to be normal.  POLLY: Ben, what are we going to do? We can't just leave the Doctor there.  BEN: What, him? The Doctor?  POLLY: Well, that's who came through the doors. There was no one else outside. Ben, do you remember what he said in the tracking room? Something about 'This old body of mine is wearing a bit thin.'  BEN: So he gets himself a new one?  POLLY: Well, yes.  BEN: Oh, do me a favour.  POLLY: Then whatever happened, happened in here.  BEN: But it's impossible.  POLLY: Not so long ago we'd have been saying that about a lot of things.  (The man on the floor moans and opens his eyes. As he struggles to sit up, a searing pain nearly cripples him. Clutching his head, he stares wildly at Ben and Polly, his vision blurred. We hear the thumping of his headache, or is it heartbeat?)  DOCTOR: Stop. Stop. Concentrate on one thing. One thing.  (The man turns his attention to the Tardis console, focusing on the controls. The thumping becomes slower and softer. At last his vision clears. The man removes his hands from his face and looks around him, his features brightening in relief.)  DOCTOR: It's over. (chuckles) It's over.  (The man scrambles to his feet, wobbling unsteadily. Ben and Polly watch but make no attempt to help as he circles the Tardis console as if reacquainting himself with the controls. His clothes hang off his slight frame, much too big, and he struggles to unfasten the heavy cloak that threatens to trip him up. As he does so, an ornate ring drops to the floor.)  BEN: Doctor?  (As the Tardis engine springs to life and dematerialises, the man raises his hands to his face once more, feeling his features as if they belonged to a stranger. Polly moves to pick up the fallen ring, eyeing the newcomer with open curiosity and a little unease. The little man makes his way over to a storage chest, his stiff-legged gait reminding Polly of a small child learning to walk. He trips, but recovers quickly.)  DOCTOR: The muscles are still a bit tight.  BEN: What are we going to do?  POLLY: It is the Doctor. I know it is. I think.  BEN: It's not only his face that's changed. He doesn't even act like him.  (The stranger is rummaging through the contents of the chest.)  BEN: Come on, it's time we sorted this out. Now look here!  DOCTOR: Hold that.  (He hands Ben a mirror.)  DOCTOR: Tilt it.  (The man gazes intently at his reflection. The face in the mirror has a mop of black hair and dark green eyes. Momentarily the image blurs and changes to that of an older, white-haired man before changing back again. Apparently satisfied, the man turns his attention back to the storage chest.)  BEN: Have you done with this?  DOCTOR: Put it down. Put it down.  BEN: Now what's the game?  (The man turns, cheerfully brandishing an ornamental dagger.)  DOCTOR: Ah! The Crusades, from Saladin. The Doctor was a great collector, wasn't he?  POLLY: But you're the Doctor.  DOCTOR: Oh, I don't look like him.  BEN: Who are we?  DOCTOR: Don't you know?  (The man rummages further and pulls out a piece of dull silver metal. His look of mischief fades as the object triggers a very clear memory.)  DOCTOR: Extermination.  (The man stuffs the metal into his pocket. His concern turns to delight as he unearths a magnifying glass. He begins a careful study of his hands.)  DOCTOR: Ah. Very good. Nails need growing.  (Ben takes the Doctor's ring from Polly.)  BEN: Now look, the Doctor always wore this. So if you're him, it should fit now, shouldn't it?  (And slips it on the man's finger. It's far too big.)  BEN: There. That settles it.  DOCTOR: I'd like to see a butterfly fit into a chrysalis case after it's spread its wings.  POLLY: Then you did change!  DOCTOR: Life depends on change and renewal.  BEN: Oh, so that's it. You've been renewed, have you?  DOCTOR: I've been renewed, have I? That's it. I've been renewed. It's part of the Tardis. Without it, I couldn't survive. Come here.  (Unexpectedly, the man rounds on Polly.)  DOCTOR: Come here.  (Still rather nervous of this strange interloper, Polly steps closer.)  DOCTOR: The Doctor kept a diary, didn't he?  POLLY: Yes.  DOCTOR: I thought so. I wonder where. I wonder where.  (Ben and Polly watch as the man resumes his search of the chest.)  POLLY: He's a very different Doctor, Ben.  BEN: Yeah, maybe. Just where do we stand, though?  (The man has found something else in the chest. A descant recorder. He removes it with great care and stands flexing his fingers over the holes. His expression is one of pure child-like joy, and convinces Polly that it's time for her to trust her instincts about the man's identity. He plays a little tune and dances a jig, stopping when he spots the missing diary.)  POLLY: Doctor?  (Tucking the recorder into his jacket, the Doctor begins to read.)  POLLY: Doctor, what's going to happen to us?  DOCTOR: I think. I think we must have landed for sometime. I think it's time we went for a stroll.  (The Doctor grabs a stove-pipe hat from the chest. Engrossed in his reading, he moves to the console and opens the Tardis doors.)  POLLY: But you don't know where we've landed!  BEN: No, you haven't checked the oxygen or the temperature or anything!  DOCTOR: (still reading the diary) Oxygen density 172, radiation nil, temperature 86. Strong suggestion of mercury deposits. Satisfied, Ben? Now, are you two coming or are you not?  POLLY: He does know us. He said Ben. Didn't you hear him?  BEN: Yeah, I heard. But he might just have been copying you though, mightn't he?
[Mercury swamp]
(The Tardis has landed in a misty swamp. The ground is rocky and pitted with small bubbling pools which occasionally spray a fine silver mist into the air. The Doctor wanders away, still fascinated by the contents of the diary. Strolling directly towards a small pool of mercury, he is apparently oblivious to any danger, yet manages to successfully circumnavigate the obstacle without once looking up from his reading. Suddenly realising what he's done, he stops and looks back, delighted at having outwitted the obstruction and laughs. But then he looks down and sloshes out of the watery puddle in which he is now standing.)  DOCTOR: Are you coming, you two?  (The Doctor continues on his way. After a short distance he stops once more. A boulder blocks his path. Pulling a tape measure from his pocket, he takes some extensive measurements of the rock, and scribbles some calculations on an empty page of the diary. The Doctor glances round him. The boulder stands in a clearing and he could easily walk round it, but a look of mischief crosses his face. Backing up a few steps, the Doctor looks down at his legs, flexing his knees.)  DOCTOR: Time I put you through some tests, I think.  (Breaking into a run, the Doctor successfully leap-frogs the boulder.)  EXAMINER: Hello?  (A newcomer has entered the clearing.)  EXAMINER: Hello? Is there anyone there? Hello? Hello? Why don't they come? (sees the Doctor) Ah, so you've come at last. I'm from Earth. I'm the Examiner.  (There's a gun shot. The man crumples to the ground. Horrified, the Doctor's about to dive for cover then pauses and, keeping low, approaches the fallen figure. He rolls the man over, and sees that he is dead. Searching for some kind of identification, the Doctor finds a large round badge. Automatically reaching into his top pocket he pulls out a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and puts them on. He squints at the badge and moves it backwards and forwards, trying to focus on it, yet all he can see is a misty blur. He removes the spectacles and tries again. This time the text is clear.)  DOCTOR: Earth Examiner. Accord every access. Vulcan.  (Behind the Doctor, a figure looms out of the mist, wearing an all-concealing white suit and goggles. The figure trains a pistol on the Doctor's back.)  BEN: Doctor, where are you?  (The Doctor turns. The figure dodges out of sight. Close to the Tardis, Ben and Polly are exploring the swamp.)  BEN: Phwoar, ain't it hot.  POLLY: Do you think the air's like this everywhere?  BEN: Nah, might be just around here. Don't want too many lungfuls of it, I know that. Here, when I was a kid, we used to live opposite a brewery. You could take a walk and get tipsy all in one go.  POLLY: It's beautiful.  BEN: No, don't touch it, Polly.  POLLY: I wasn't going to.  BEN: No, it's quicksilver. It gets through the pores. Where is the Doctor, or whatever he is, got to?  (As Ben moves away, a cloud of mercury vapour catches Polly full in the face. She coughs.)  BEN: What's the matter? Hey, Polly! Hey, Doctor, wherever you are. Quick, there's something happening to Polly!  (The Doctor heads back to the Tardis at a run.)  BEN: Quick! Over this way!  (Pistol raised as a bludgeon, the suited figure steps out behind the Doctor and knocks him down. The Doctor grabs at the figure briefly before sinking to the ground, unconscious. Working quickly, the stranger presses something into the Doctor's palm then drags the Examiner's body away. The Doctor is left sprawled on the ground, a button clutched in his outstretched hand.)  (Meanwhile, Ben is trying to drag the unconscious Polly to safety. Another cloud of mercury vapour rises from the pool.)  BEN: Doctor!  (The last thing Ben sees before he passes out, is a white suited figure holding a pistol approaching fast.)  (Some time later, a young man in a white survival suit, goggles pushed up over his head, is kneeling besides the seemingly unconscious Doctor. Another older man, similarly attired, approaches.)  BRAGEN: Ah, Quinn, there you are. What have you got there? My people have found two more of them by one of the pools.  QUINN: This one's got a nasty bruise on the back of his head. Fallen over his feet and knocked himself out, I suppose.  BRAGEN: I suppose so.  QUINN: Why don't they use the kit we send them?  BRAGEN: Yes. The other two have had a rather bad dose of fumes. The girl has, anyway.  QUINN: Girl?  BRAGEN: Yes, but she'll recover.  (Ben and Polly are helped into the clearing by two guards.)  QUINN: These comic opera guards of yours do have some uses after all.  BRAGEN: I pick them for their physical fitness.  QUINN: I thought it wasn't for their IQ. Give me a hand with the Examiner, will you.  BRAGEN: I wonder why Earth has chosen to send an Examiner to Vulcan? Just now, I mean.  QUINN: I don't know.  BRAGEN: It's a mystery, isn't it? He isn't due for another two years.  (Ben is recovering.)  QUINN: How do you feel?  BEN: (cough) Urgh.  QUINN: We saw your rocket overshoot the landing area.  BEN: Ay?  QUINN: Don't worry. Most of the ships from Earth do over-shoot. I'm Quinn, Deputy Governor.  BRAGEN: Bragen, Head of Security.  QUINN: Let's get them all back, shall we? I'll take the girl.  BRAGEN: Here, you two, help carry the Examiner.  (The guards lift the Doctor between them.)  BRAGEN: I suppose you Earth people can't wait to examine Lesterson's space capsule?  BEN: Ay?  (Ben is startled as the Doctor winks slyly at him.)
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Lesterson is polishing an oddly shaped piece of metal. A huge space capsule dominates one side of the room. Lesterson's assistant, Janley, joins him.)  JANLEY: (a woman) Lesterson.  LESTERSON: Look at this.  JANLEY: They've just brought in an Examiner from Earth, and a couple of assistants.  LESTERSON: An Examiner? What's he here for?  JANLEY: I thought you'd know.  LESTERSON: It's the capsule, it must be. Well, they can't stop me working on it, I'll tell you that.  JANLEY: Could anyone?  LESTERSON: The Governor's always been difficult about it. But surely they wouldn't send somebody all the way from Earth just  JANLEY: Look, what about the meeting?  LESTERSON: Meeting?  JANLEY: Yes. I've arranged everything. Can we still use the old rocket room?  LESTERSON: Yes, I suppose so. But I do wish you wouldn't get mixed up with these pressure groups, Janley.  JANLEY: Well, somebody has to do something. The colony's running down and you know it.  LESTERSON: I'm too busy.  JANLEY: But if we ran things, you'd have better facilities, more money. I wish you'd take an interest.  LESTERSON: Now look, I don't mind letting you have the use of one of my rooms now and again, Janley, but don't try to involve me. This is what I find important. Two hundred years in a mercury swamp and this piece of metal that dropped from it? Look, a couple of minutes polishing and it's as good as new.  JANLEY: Wonderful.  LESTERSON: Rain, damp, heat, mercury. Nothing touches this metal. No corrosion, Janley. Think of that.  JANLEY: Well, I hope the Examiner lets you go on with your experiment. Frankly, I doubt it. I think the Governor's brought the Examiner here to stop you opening the capsule. You should join our group, Lesterson. You might need us one day.
[Guest quarters]
(Fully recovered, the Doctor, Ben and Polly have been left to make themselves comfortable. The Doctor is plays on his recorder.)  BEN: So the murdered man was the real Examiner?  (Nodding, the Doctor blows a pair of notes.)  BEN: Well, did you see who did it?  (Top note screech.)  POLLY: The Doctor got this button though.  BEN: I think it's pretty dull around here. I don't know why we don't just go back to the Tardis.  POLLY: Doctor, are you going to let them think you're the real Examiner?  (Two notes repeated.)  POLLY: Won't that be dangerous?  (Two notes again.)  BEN: Look, why don't you stop blowing that thing and talk to us properly?  POLLY: Ben!  BEN: Now don't you start. It's bad enough with him.  POLLY: Well, he hasn't done anything.  BEN: No, that's just the trouble.  (Ben snatches the recorder away.)  BEN: He knows what happened back at the Tardis, yet will he tell us? Will he come out and say? Will he admit to being the Doctor?  (Ben blows angrily into the recorder. There is a knock on the door.)  BEN: Come in!  (Two guards in peaked caps and dark uniforms enter, with Bragen and a large bearded man in his late fifties.)  HENSELL: I am Hensell, the Governor. I trust you're all feeling much better?  BEN: I've felt worse, Governor. The Governor.  HENSELL: If Earth had seen fit to warn us you were coming, we might possibly have been able to guide you down to the landing area.  DOCTOR: If Earth didn't warn you we were coming, Governor, they must have had a very good reason. I wonder what it was?  HENSELL: Now look here, I run this Colony. I'm entitled to know why you have come to Vulcan. What is your brief?  DOCTOR: I am the Examiner.  HENSELL: Why are you here?  DOCTOR: To examine. And I intend to start my examination at once.  (The Doctor darts forward and begins to examine Bragen's tunic.)  HENSELL: Someone's leaked reports about these Rebel groups. That's it, isn't it?  DOCTOR: Your turn now, Governor.  (The Doctor turns his attention to Hensell's clothing.)  BRAGEN: There is Lesterson's capsule.  HENSELL: Internal affairs are my business, Bragen. Please don't interfere.  DOCTOR: Please go on.  HENSELL: The capsule. It was found in a mercury swamp. It must have been here for centuries.  DOCTOR: Interesting. Continue.  HENSELL: For centuries before the Earth colony arrived. I felt it might be dangerous. It might contain bacteria.  DOCTOR: I shall examine the capsule later. You may leave us.  HENSELL: I shall look forward to your report. Bragen, see that the Examiner and his party get some proper clothes, will you?  (Hensell, Bragen, and the guards leave.)  DOCTOR: We are wearing proper clothes.  (The Doctor starts playing again.)  BEN: Oh, how did he get that thing back again. That was a bit of a cheek, wasn't it, seeing if the Governor was the guy you got the button off?  POLLY: Doctor? When he was talking to you, you were staring at the other man.  DOCTOR: Yes, very rude of me, wasn't it. Terrible manners. To tell you the truth, I was studying his reaction, seeing if he agreed with the story.  BEN: Did he?  DOCTOR: Must have a look at that capsule.  BEN: Now, you want to watch you don't take this Examiner stuff a bit too far.  DOCTOR: Our answers must come from that mercury swamp.  BEN: 'Cause at least one bloke ain't going to be fooled.  DOCTOR: When Bragen found us, he definitely said space capsule.  BEN: Look, you're not going to fool the guy that did the real Examiner in!
[Corridor]
(A little later Bragen, accompanied by a guard, is posting a notice on a board. Quinn approaches.)  QUINN: Bragen! What's all this nonsense about having to have a pass to see the Examiner?  BRAGEN: It's the Governor's idea.  QUINN: Surely it doesn't apply to me?  BRAGEN: It's not my order, Quinn. I expect the Governor wants to keep people away from him.  QUINN: It sounded like one of your red-tape ideas.  BRAGEN: It had nothing to do with me.  QUINN: Right!  (Quinn strides away, practically colliding with Janley.)  JANLEY: Oh!  QUINN: Sorry, Janley.  JANLEY: My fault.  QUINN: Are you all right?  JANLEY: Yes. Lesterson's just cleared me out of his lab. Is the Examiner going to let him open the capsule?  QUINN: I don't know. I'm on my way there now, if I can push past Bragen's army of lay-abouts.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Later that evening, the Doctor takes Ben and Polly to see the space capsule. The Doctor spots the piece of metal that Lesterson was polishing earlier. He picks it up and examines it, worriedly.)  DOCTOR: Where did you get this?  LESTERSON: It dropped from the capsule.  DOCTOR: Dropped?  LESTERSON: Yes, when it was being hauled into the laboratory. But, you can see, this metal could revolutionise space travel. That's why I'm insisting that we open it. Well, who knows what other marvels there may be inside?  HENSELL: But Lesterson, I didn't think you could open it.  LESTERSON: Well, I have a theory. I'm convinced that the opening mechanism on the other side is either here, or here.  (While Lesterson is occupied, the Doctor pulls out the piece of metal he found in the Tardis and compares the two. They are identical.)  DOCTOR: Extermination.  LESTERSON: Now, my theory is that I can insert a laser ray in this ridge here. The ray spreads, fuses the opening device and gets us in.  HENSELL: Examiner, I shall have to make it your responsibility.  DOCTOR: A laser. Why not? It shouldn't be too difficult.  (The laser fires at the first spot. Nothing happens.)  LESTERSON: Well, we'll try the other side.  (Lesterson refocuses the laser. A mechanism engages and the hatchway slides open. The Doctor and Lesterson step into the capsule.
[Capsule entry]
(A small brightly lit chamber. The Doctor studies the far wall. Everyone else crowds in.)  LESTERSON: Hmm. It's a bit disappointing.  DOCTOR: Not really. This is just an entry bay, isn't it.  LESTERSON: Yes, I suppose so.  HENSELL: Well, this doesn't get us very far, does it?  LESTERSON: Getting into the rest of the capsule will take time, Governor.  BEN: Well, can't you use that torch thing again? That must be an opening door.  LESTERSON: I should have to measure it up and find out where the lock mechanism is.  DOCTOR: I think we'll leave if for tonight.  HENSELL: Leave it for tonight? But what did we come here for?  DOCTOR: That is my decision, Governor.  HENSELL: But good heavens above, man.  DOCTOR: A hundred years you say this has been buried?  LESTERSON: Oh, at least. Now, there must be something in the inner compartment. We shall be able to find out where it came from originally.  DOCTOR: It didn't come from this planet Vulcan.  LESTERSON: Oh no, no, no. The metal is quite alien.  DOCTOR: Alien, yes. Very alien. Goodnight.  (The Doctor leaves the laboratory.)  BEN: What's he up to now?  POLLY: Ben, we're not going to let him out of our sight.  (Ben and Polly follow the Doctor from the lab.)
[Lesterson's laboratory]
HENSELL: Well, Lesterson, you got your way. Was it worth sending for this Examiner? This idiotic Examiner?  LESTERSON: I didn't send for him. I thought you did.  QUINN: Why don't you let me talk to the Examiner, Hensell. I can find out what's he's here for.  HENSELL: No, no, no, no. You keep away from him. We'll leave him to work with Lesterson here. We've all got enough to do without having to worry about some amateur critic from Earth interfering.  QUINN: But with five minutes  HENSELL: You heard what I said, Quinn. You won't mind keeping the Examiner busy, Lesterson? I don't mind what you do with him so long as you keep his nose out of our business.  LESTERSON: Yes. All right.  HENSELL: All right. Well, we shall talk about it tomorrow.  (Once he's alone, Lesterson returns to his workbench where he quickly realises that his metal sample has disappeared.)
[Guest quarters]
(Later that night.)  POLLY: Ben!  BEN: (waking) What?  POLLY: Shh! He's in the corridor.  BEN: Who is?  POLLY: The Doctor, you clod. Come on, quick!
[Corridor]
POLLY: He's going towards Lesterson's lab.  BEN: Of course. To the space capsule.  POLLY: Come on.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(The Doctor steps into the deserted laboratory, which is eerily illuminated by the light glowing from the interior of the capsule. At the capsule entrance, he dips into his pockets and takes out the two pieces of metal. Ben and Polly appear in the doorway of the lab just in time to see the Doctor disappear into the capsule.)
[Capsule entrance]
(The Doctor crosses to the far wall and inserts one of the pieces of metal into a narrow opening. An inner door slides open, revealing a second compartment. The Doctor edges forward, peering into the gloom. Two shapes are silhouetted against the dull metal glow. Familiar, giant pepperpot shapes.)  DOCTOR: Polly, Ben, come in and meet the Daleks.  BEN: What?  DOCTOR: The Daleks.  (As Polly approaches, a sucker arm drops.)  POLLY: You could have opened this before.  DOCTOR: These two pieces of metal are identical. The Doctor got one of them from the Daleks himself.  BEN: Why do you keep saying the Doctor if you mean you?  DOCTOR: I knew I should find them here. I knew it.  BEN: Ah, they look harmless. Not very lively.  POLLY: What do you think? Two hundred years in a swamp and you wouldn't look very lively either. Nothing could live through that, could it?  BEN: Live?  DOCTOR: Nothing human, no.  POLLY: Doctor, look.  BEN: What's the matter?  (The Doctor kneels to examine the marks on the dusty floor.)  DOCTOR: There were three Daleks in here! What's happened to the other one?  (Ben catches sight of something moving in the corner behind the Doctor.)  BEN: Doctor!  (Polly screams. The Doctor spins around. A clawed mutant scuttles from the shadows across the floor.)
Episode Two
[Capsule]
DOCTOR: A light. A torch, outside.  BEN: Did you see it?  DOCTOR: Quickly, Ben, quickly!  POLLY: What was it?  (Ben runs out into the laboratory to look for the torch. He soon finds a lamp with a long lead and drags it back into the capsule, unaware that he's being watched by Resno, one of Lesterson's assistants. The Doctor takes the lamp and begins checking every corner of the compartment.)  POLLY: Can you answer me?  BEN: It was a sort of disembodied hand. A sort of claw. It was horrible.  (The Doctor searches for a while but doesn't find anything.)  DOCTOR: No. No, there's nothing.  BEN: You were right. There were three Daleks.  POLLY: Don't you know what it was? If there were three, who moved it?  BEN: Don't ask me. Lesterson?  POLLY: But he hadn't opened the capsule.  BEN: No, he said he hadn't opened it. Lets get our facts straight.  DOCTOR: Ah ha. Excellent! Good thinking, good thinking.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
BEN: Well, does that mean you think he's been inside?  DOCTOR: Perhaps he's been experimenting on the Daleks? Ah.  POLLY: But, but they're things. I, I mean they're dead. They must be!  DOCTOR: This light is dead. Now the watch.  (The Doctor flicks the torch on and off.)  BEN: Do you mean these things just need power?  DOCTOR: Now, Lesterson's fanatic. The Governor's jealous of his own position. What does that suggest to you? Don't know. Haven't thought about it. But all is not well with this colony. Add to that one Dalek.  BEN: Oh, blimey, you don't half make mountains, don't you? One Dalek?  DOCTOR: Yes! All that is needed to wipe out this entire colony.
[Guest quarters]
QUINN: Examiner? Examiner?  (Bragen enters.)  QUINN: Bragen, don't you ever knock before you enter a room?  BRAGEN: I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I was expecting to find the Examiner here, not you, Quinn.  QUINN: Well, he's not here. You'll probably want to start snooping under the bed, so I'll leave you to it.  BRAGEN: One moment.  QUINN: Don't try your luck with me, Bragen.  BRAGEN: On the contrary, I'm trying to avoid trouble. The Governor gave express instructions that you were not to contact the Examiner. I find you here. I'm sure you can offer some suitable explanation.  QUINN: I can. But not to you.  BRAGEN: Before you go. Oh!  (Quinn shoves Bragen to the floor.)  QUINN: Don't ever try to block my way again.  BRAGEN: Guard!  (As Quinn leaves a guard enters and helps Bragen to his feet.)  BRAGEN: The Examiner is missing. He must be found immediately.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(The Doctor is examining the exterior of the capsule.)  BEN: Of course, the real Doctor was always going on about the Daleks.  POLLY: Real Doctor?  DOCTOR: Real Doctor? Oh, you mean the real Doctor.  BEN: Yeah, now I've seen that claw thing, well, wouldn't want to shake hands with it, let's put it that way.  POLLY: Doctor, look, if they're that dangerous, what are you going to do about it?  DOCTOR: Save my breath. Would Lesterson listen? Lesterson listen. Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen. Exercises the tongue. Try it. Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen.  BEN: Look, they think you're the Examiner, order them to destroy the Daleks. Well, chuck your weight about.  POLLY: (in background) Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen.  POLLY + DOCTOR: Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...  (Behind them, Lesterson and Resno enter.)  LESTERSON: What do you think you're doing in here?  DOCTOR: Listen, listen.  (The Doctor holds out the Examiner's badge.)  LESTERSON: Who gave you permission?  DOCTOR: Read this. Aloud!  LESTERSON: Accord every access.  DOCTOR: Exactly! It doesn't say 'except your laboratory' anywhere does it? Unless it's in micro-print.  LESTERSON: I should have been asked first.  DOCTOR: What was the first thing you noticed when you looked inside that capsule?  BEN: Well, the Daleks.  DOCTOR: You were astounded?  POLLY: Yes.  DOCTOR: Amazed?  BEN: Yes.  DOCTOR: You didn't even give them a glance! Why? Because you'd been in there and seen them. Where is the third Dalek?  LESTERSON: I don't know what you're talking about.  DOCTOR: You opened up the capsule without permission. You found the inner compartment containing three Daleks. You took one of them away and you hid it!  LESTERSON: Hid it? What, what nonsense!  BRAGEN: May I ask what all this is about?  POLLY: We opened an inner compartment in the capsule, and Lesterson had already been in there.  LESTERSON: I don't deny that.  BEN: And he's nicked a Dalek!  BRAGEN: Dalek?  LESTERSON: It's the name the Examiner has given to two metal creations that I've discovered inside the capsule.  BEN: And they're dangerous. Evil.  LESTERSON: Lumps of metal. Quite inactive.  BEN: That's what you think, mate. If you'd seen  (The Doctor's recorder silences Ben.)  LESTERSON: I consider it my duty as a scientist to examine and investigate these objects. Now please, all of you, keep out of my laboratory. Keep your hands off my experiments!  DOCTOR: These lumps of metal, Daleks, I want them broken up, or melted down. Up or down, I don't care which, but destroyed!  LESTERSON: I refuse to allow it.  DOCTOR: I'm an Earth Examiner. I demand it.  LESTERSON: You're exceeding your authority.  DOCTOR: Perhaps we should ask the Governor about that? I wish to see him immediately.  BRAGEN: That might be difficult.  DOCTOR: But not impossible. Ben, Polly.  (The Doctor, Ben, and Polly leave, followed by Bragen.)  RESNO: Could he stop the experiments?  LESTERSON: I don't know. It's none of your business. You go and get Janley and then come back here. We haven't got any time to waste. Now go on, man. Quickly, quickly.  (Resno leaves. Lesterson goes to the capsule and opens a hidden compartment, revealing the third Dalek.)  LESTERSON: They won't stop me experimenting. There must be some way to bring you back to life, and I'm going to find it.
[Guest quarters]
BRAGEN: And of course you do have the right of any access.  DOCTOR: Which is why I have a badge which says so.  BRAGEN: Lesterson watches over his ideas like a mother hen.  DOCTOR: If there was a bomb under this floor timed to go off in five minutes, would you ask my permission before you ripped up the floorboards? Ah ha, fruit!  POLLY: Thank you.  BRAGEN: Examiner, it's up to you of course, but I'd advise a little discretion in your investigations. It's not a very good time, just now.  (The Doctor is generously distributing fruit from a bowl by the bedside.)  BRAGEN: Thank you. With all these disturbances  POLLY: Disturbances?  BRAGEN: Yes, minor acts of sabotage. Rebel cliques, secret newspapers, nothing important you understand, but it keeps the Governor busy. I've no doubt he'll tell you about it himself when I arrange your meeting with him.  BEN: When will that be?  BRAGEN: Oh, he's going on a tour of the perimeter of the colony. I'll find out if he can see you before he goes.  POLLY: Thank you.  (Bragen leaves. Polly sits next to Ben on the bed.)  BEN: You know, it's little things like this that make it difficult to believe that you're the Doctor. The other one, I mean. The proper one. Oh, nuts, you know what I mean.  DOCTOR: Nuts? Yes, certainly, here we are. Crackers?  BEN: You, my old china, are an out and out phony!  DOCTOR: China. Yes, I went there once I believe. Met Marco Polo.  BEN: No, not China. China! China and plate, mate, friend.  DOCTOR: Yes, Marco Polo, a friend. I believe he was.  POLLY: Don't listen to him, Doctor. I know who you are.  DOCTOR: Shh!  (The Doctor gestures Polly into silence as he listens closely to a piece of fruit he's chosen from the bowl. Gently placing the fruit on the table, he pulls a pen knife from his pocket and carefully slices the fruit in half.)  POLLY: It's a  (Concealed in the middle of the fruit is a tiny listening device. Indicating that Ben and Polly should remain silent, the Doctor extracts the device, drops it to the floor and stamps down hard, crushing it.)  BEN: Well, well, a touch of the bugs. Microphones.  POLLY: Someone's been listening to what we were saying!  BEN: Yes, so that's why you were messing about and talking nonsense.  DOCTOR: I never talk nonsense.  POLLY: Ahem.  DOCTOR: Well, hardly never.  BEN: Well, they certainly believe in making us at home, don't they?  DOCTOR: At first, I thought there might be more than one.  BEN: Here, I bet old Charlie Bragen did it.  POLLY: Charlie?  BEN: Well Fred wouldn't suit him, would it.  POLLY: If he did do it, do you think it was his own idea? I mean, he could have been under orders.  BEN: You mean from the Governor? Ah, I don't know. What do you think, Doctor?  DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes of course. Let's consider this button for a moment. It's the only clue we've got to the murderer of the Examiner. The real Examiner.  POLLY: And who asked for him to come?  BEN: Well, Lesterson's crackers about that capsule. He wouldn't want anyone nosing about.  POLLY: Bragen said the Governor's been having trouble.  BEN: No, rule him out. Governors are all the same. He wouldn't ask for help. If he sent the word it would look as if he couldn't do the job properly.  POLLY: Yes.  BEN: Oh, well, I vote we go back to the Tardis. I've had enough of this dump.  DOCTOR: Have you? What about the Daleks?  BEN: Well, they're dead.  POLLY: Well, what about that thing we saw in the capsule? That was alive all right.  BEN: Yeah, I can't explain that.  DOCTOR: I can. And that's why we have to stay.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
RESNO: Ugly-looking brutes, aren't they?  (Janley and Resno are wiring up the Dalek for testing.)  RESNO: What's he want to muck about with them for? Leave well alone, that's what I say.  JANLEY: You're a fine one to be a research assistant. Leave well alone. There'll be no progress on this planet with people like you around.  RESNO: We're doing all right as we are. Or we were until your lot came along stirring things up. You won't get away with it, you know. The Governor knows all about you rebels. He'll smash the lot of you when he's ready.  JANLEY: Governor?  RESNO: Yeah, the Governor!  JANLEY: He couldn't smash  LESTERSON: Will you be quiet! Where do you both think you are? This is a scientific laboratory. Kindly keep your politics out of it. Come on, Resno, man, get on with it. We haven't got all day. We've got to get this working before the Examiner stops us. He's got some phobia about these, these Daleks.
[Guest quarters]
(The Doctor is sitting on the bed clutching his diary.)  DOCTOR: I know the misery they cause, the destruction. But there's something else more terrible. Something I can only half remember.  POLLY: Doctor, what was it?  (A knock at the door. Bragen enters.)  DOCTOR: Well? Where is the Governor? What did he say?  BRAGEN: He sends his apologies, Examiner. He can't see you tonight, but he hopes to see you first thing in the morning.  BEN: Well, it might not wait that long, Char, ah, Bragen.  BRAGEN: It will have to.  DOCTOR: Excuse me.  BEN: Where are you going?  DOCTOR: To see the Governor, of course.  BRAGEN: I'm afraid that's not possible. Once his door is closed, no one, not even you, Examiner, is allowed into his room.  DOCTOR: Very well.  BRAGEN: Thank you. Until the morning then.  (Bragen leaves.)  BEN: What happens now?  DOCTOR: I shall radio Earth. Governor or not, Hensell will have to listen to them. I'll get Earth to back me.  (Suddenly the Doctor yanks open the door. The corridor is empty.)  DOCTOR: That's funny. I could have sworn. You stay here. I shan't be long.  (As he leaves, Ben and Polly see the Doctor slip the door knob into his pocket. They laugh.)
[Lesterson's laboratory]
LESTERSON: Connecting now.  RESNO: All connections responding.  LESTERSON: Nothing at all?  RESNO: No.  LESTERSON: Are you sure?  RESNO: There's nothing wrong here.  LESTERSON: Well, let's see.  RESNO: Really, if you can't trust me to read a dial.  LESTERSON: Be quiet. All right, we'll try again. This time we'll take it up to 3.24. Got that, Janley?  JANLEY: 3.24.  (Very slowly, the Dalek's sucker arm begins to rise.)  RESNO: It's moving.  LESTERSON: Now, note this, Janley. Number one attachment with sucker stick responding. Number two attachment not moving. Number three attachment with lens responding. Watch these meters, Resno.  RESNO: Still responding.  LESTERSON: Now, it's reasonable to assume that this the sucker stick acts like some kind of a hand.  (Janley screams.)  LESTERSON: It's all right. Don't be alarmed. We've only introduced temporary power. We shall have to be able to open it up before we could find how it works permanently.  JANLEY: It's a bit frightening.  LESTERSON: Yes. Now, I cannot think what this short stubby arm is for.  JANLEY: Could the lens attachment be an eye?  LESTERSON: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Now it's quite possible that this, Dalek, now there must be some kind of directing influence. There may even be a simplified brain. Positronic, I shouldn't wonder. Oh, if only we could open it up.  (The sucker arm drops suddenly.)  LESTERSON: Now what?  RESNO: Everything functioning here.  LESTERSON: Yes. Well, perhaps the power is leaking away somewhere. We'll try again.  (Janley increases the power supply to the Dalek. The Dale's eye-stick rises slowly.)  RESNO: Look at the eye-stick! It's watching us!  LESTERSON: Don't be absurd.  RESNO: It was, I tell you. I saw it.  LESTERSON: You can't use the phrase 'watching us'. You'll have us believing that the thing has intelligence next. Now, get on with your work, man.
[Communications room]
(The Doctor finds the door ajar and the room in semi-darkness. The place is a mess. The equipment has been sabotaged and the control panel smashed. The body of the radio operator lies on the floor, unconscious. The Doctor checks he is alive and hears movement across the room.)  DOCTOR: I know you're there.  (Quinn steps from the shadows.)  QUINN: Examiner, thank goodness it's you. I've been trying to talk to you ever since you got here.  (Bragen enters.)  BRAGEN: What's happening here? You again.  QUINN: What do you want?  DOCTOR: I found the operator unconscious.  QUINN: Yes, so did I. I was just looking at him when I heard someone move. It must have been you.  BRAGEN: And those?  (Quinn is holding a set of wire cutters.)  QUINN: I picked them up. What is all this?  DOCTOR: The cables have been cut.  QUINN: What? This is serious. It's not just our own communications. We're cut off from Earth as well.  BRAGEN: The only people that would want to do that are the rebels.  QUINN: If those muscle boys of yours had any brains, they'd stop things like this.  DOCTOR: Bragen, I was attacked just after I landed. This is a small souvenir I collected.  BRAGEN: This button belongs to you, doesn't it?  QUINN: Well, yes.  BRAGEN: And you say you picked these up? I suggest that you were sabotaging the communications.  QUINN: That's a lie.  BRAGEN: Having first attacked one of the engineers. I'd detain the Governor on evidence like that.  QUINN: I hope you're not thinking of detaining me, Bragen.  BRAGEN: I've no option. I could hardly let you run around loose after this, could I? All right, guards.  QUINN: I warn you, Bragen!  (As the guards close around him, Quinn relaxes.)  QUINN: All right, you win this round, Bragen. We'll see what it looks like in front of the Governor.  BRAGEN: The Governor will want an enquiry. May I ask what you were doing here?
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Resno has set up a camera on a tripod in front of the Dalek.)  LESTERSON: Right. I've redirected power. This time working up to 4.68. Now, Resno, you will have to dodge between the camera and your meters.  RESNO: Ready.  LESTERSON: Connecting now.  RESNO: All connections responding.  LESTERSON: Excellent.  JANLEY: It's working!  LESTERSON: Excellent. Film it, film it now, Resno. And note the readings, Janley.  (The Dalek's eye-stick spins around and fixes on Resno.)  LESTERSON: It seems to be interested in you, Resno. What's the matter with you, man?  RESNO: I tell you it's intelligent. It's watching me, Lesterson, weighing me up. I can sense it.  LESTERSON: Don't be a fool.  RESNO: I don't like it, I tell you. I don't know what these things can do.  LESTERSON: No, and we never shall know, shall we, unless we take film of every reaction. Now get on with your work, man.  (Reluctantly, Resno returns to the camera. Suddenly, the Dalek's gun-stick emits a blast of negative light. Resno crumples to the floor, the camera crashing down on top of him.)  LESTERSON: Resno!  (Lesterson disconnects the power.)  JANLEY: It's all right, he isn't dead.  LESTERSON: What happened?  JANLEY: Knocked out by the shock wave.  LESTERSON: We must get him to the hospital. I'll go and get help.  (Lesterson leaves. Janley kneels by Resno then reaches for a dust sheet and starts to wrap the body.)
[Guest quarters]
(The next morning, the Doctor stands at the window, deep in thought. He starts playing his recorder.)  POLLY: But we've got to defend Quinn.  BEN: Yeah, I know. He's innocent until he's proved guilty. But he is guilty.  POLLY: He's the Deputy Governor.  BEN: So what? I had a headmaster once who got nicked for not paying his bus fare. And then there's the motive. Don't forget the motive.  POLLY: Like what, for instance?  BEN: Well, he's the Deputy Governor, right? Maybe he wants to be Governor.  POLLY: Oh, that's ridiculous.  BEN: Well, the jacket button wasn't. And he was caught red-handed in the Communications room with a pair of pliers. And don't tell me he was plucking his eye-brows either.  POLLY: Look, there are some people you know are all right. You just know by looking at them.  BRAGEN: Good morning. The enquiry is about to begin. I've been sent to escort you.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Lesterson is preparing the Dalek for a demonstration.)  LESTERSON: Hello, Janley.  JANLEY: Is it time?  LESTERSON: Yes, yes, I think so. I feel quite excited.  JANLEY: So you should. It's a wonderful achievement.  LESTERSON: Yes, yes, but the wonderful thing, Janley, is that we don't know the full scope of this experiment. Who knows where we may go from here. Who know what this Dalek may do?  JANLEY: It's harmless now?  LESTERSON: Yes, yes, yes. I've removed. Oh, Resno. Have you been to see him today?  JANLEY: Yes, yes.  LESTERSON: And?  JANLEY: He's had medical attention. He's going to be all right.  LESTERSON: Oh good.  JANLEY: No one must find out about this accident. It might give the Examiner just the excuse they want, and he could stop the whole project.  LESTERSON: Oh yes. Yes, yes, yes, you're right.  JANLEY: Well. Ready?  LESTERSON: Yes. Let's go and surprise them.
[Governor's office]
(The Doctor, Ben and Polly are shown in.)  HENSELL: I am sorry I couldn't see you earlier, Examiner. Please sit down.  (Quinn is escorted in under guard.)  HENSELL: Well, Quinn, I don't like this any more than you do. What have you been up to?  QUINN: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.  HENSELL: Well, what about Bragen's report then? These are facts, Quinn. Now, what have you got to say about it?  QUINN: Does the engineer say I hit him?  BRAGEN: How could he if he was hit from behind?  QUINN: Then its only circumstantial evidence.  BRAGEN: The Examiner was also attacked in the mercury swamp. We have a button from your jacket found in the Examiner's hand.  QUINN: I can't explain that.  BRAGEN: I'm sure you can't.  HENSELL: Examiner. You seem to be in two minds.  BEN: (sotto) Yeah, and two bodies.  HENSELL: You mentioned to Bragen that these machines of Lesterson's. What do you call them?  DOCTOR: I call them what they are, Daleks.  HENSELL: Yes, yes, yes, Daleks. You say they could be a motive for destroying our communications.  DOCTOR: I do.  (Lesterson enters.)  HENSELL: Lesterson, this is a special enquiry. Now please.  LESTERSON: This won't wait. You won't be disappointed.  HENSELL: You heard what I said, Lesterson.  LESTERSON: Governor, I've just completed an experiment which could revolutionise the whole colony. Bear with me.  DOCTOR: Lesterson, what have you done? What have you done?  LESTERSON: I'll show you. Janley, now!  (Lesterson's Dalek glides into the room. It's movement is strangely fascinating, holding everyone transfixed. Everyone except the Doctor who edges backwards, shaking his head in horror. The Dalek stops and looks around at each person in turn. At last it re-focuses on the Doctor. The Doctor backs into a chair.)  BEN: It recognised the Doctor. It recognised him.  POLLY: What's the matter, Doctor? Are you all right?  DOCTOR: The fools. The stupid fools.  BEN: You're scared. What can it do?  DOCTOR: Nothing yet.  LESTERSON: This creation is called, I understand, a Dalek.  BEN: It knew who you were. It sounds ridiculous, but it did.  DOCTOR: It knew who I was.  BEN: The Dalek knows who you are.  LESTERSON: Now, look at it. I have merely given it electrical power, but it is capable of storing it. Moreover, it responds to orders. Turn around.  (The Dalek obeys.)  LESTERSON: Move that chair.  (The Dalek pushes the chair across the room.)  LESTERSON: Stop. You see? Well, just think what this could do for our mining program, our processing, packaging. Dozens of labour jobs, Governor. It may even supply the end to all this Colony's problems.  DOCTOR: Yes, it will end the colony's problems, because it will end the colony.  DALEK: I am your servant.  LESTERSON: It, it spoke! Janley, did you hear it? It can actually talk.  DOCTOR: It can do many things, Lesterson. But the thing it does most efficiently is exterminate human beings. It destroys them, without mercy, without conscience. It destroys them. Utterly. Completely. It destroys them.  DALEK: (trying to drown out the Doctor) I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant.
Episode Three
[Governor's office]
HENSELL: So, Lesterson, they're even capable of speech.  LESTERSON: Yes. But then, why not? After all, they have a certain intelligence.  HENSELL: Yes, I know, but  LESTERSON: But it is an intelligence that we can control.  HENSELL: So what you want is permission to continue your experiments?  LESTERSON: Governor, think what it would mean if we were to set it to work in the mines. It could double our production overnight.  BRAGEN: Consider the effects it could have on our whole economy.  HENSELL: Yes, and the effect of that on Earth. Yes, yes, they could be very grateful.  DOCTOR: (to Dalek) I shall stop you. I will.  HENSELL: All right, Lesterson, permission granted.  DOCTOR: Permission? Permission for what?  LESTERSON: To continue my work, Examiner.  DOCTOR: But, but didn't you all hear what I said? The Daleks must be destroyed!  LESTERSON: Never!  DOCTOR: Very well. If not by my order, then by Earth's! Come Ben, Polly.  HENSELL: Ah, Examiner, just a moment. Tell me, why are you so against this project?  DOCTOR: But I've told you! I realise I can't give you any proof, but you've no idea of the danger.  LESTERSON: No.  DOCTOR: Yes. Danger! I shall be contacting Earth just as soon as radio communications have been restored.  (The Doctor glares at the Dalek.)  DOCTOR: You're my servant, are you?  DALEK: I am.  DOCTOR: Very well. Immobilise yourself. Go on. I order it! Immediately!  (The Dalek's eye-stalk droops.)  DOCTOR: Huh!  (The Doctor leaves with Ben and Polly. The Dalek comes back to life.)  JANLEY: Lesterson.  LESTERSON: Why did you stop obeying? You were given an order.  DALEK: He has gone.  LESTERSON: Then you obey only  DALEK: His order was wrong. I cannot serve human beings if I am immobilised. You gave me power. Your orders are right. I serve you.  HENSELL: Lesterson. Lesterson, it reasons. Just how limited is its intelligence?  LESTERSON: Now, there is no cause for concern, Governor. Just you wait until you see the amount of work it can do. And now, I'm really going to put you through your paces. Follow me, Dalek.  DALEK: I obey.  (The Dalek follows Lesterson and Janley.)
[Corridor]
DOCTOR: That's it!  POLLY: We should have stayed with Quinn.  BEN: Well, we couldn't have helped him, Polly, even if we'd wanted to. The Governor's already reached his verdict.  DOCTOR: Wire. Scissors. Tape.  POLLY: But he didn't murder the real Examiner. I'm sure he didn't.  BEN: Oh, well. The way I see it this lot's too busy arguing amongst themselves to do much about anything. Anyway, first things first. The Daleks are the important thing.  DOCTOR: Ah! Congratulations, Ben!  BEN: What did I do? What did I do?  DOCTOR: You just used your brains, that's what you did. The Daleks are the most important thing.  POLLY: I still think Quinn's innocent.
[Governor's office]
QUINN: How can I be in league with the rebels?  BRAGEN: The evidence confirms it.  QUINN: It was I that warned of their dangers.  BRAGEN: As part of your overall plan.  QUINN: You wouldn't even take the matter seriously.  BRAGEN: If I was wrong then, I have a chance to rectify it now.  QUINN: If that's going to be your attitude, I suggest that we  HENSELL: Quinn! Let us conduct this inquiry in an orderly manner. Now, the Examiner was attacked. There can be no question of that.  BRAGEN: And the button grabbed by the Examiner was missing from your suit.  HENSELL: Yes, if you've got anything to add to that, you'd better say it now.  QUINN: I didn't attack the man. I had no reason to. I was the one that sent for him.  HENSELL: You sent for him?  QUINN: It was necessary. Under the circumstances, I'd hardly be likely to sabotage the radio communications.  HENSELL: But, but why Quinn? Why?  QUINN: Because of the rebels!  BRAGEN: The rebels. They're nothing more than one or two fanatics.  QUINN: You know as well as I do that they  BRAGEN: Unless you're trying to create trouble here to undermine the Governor's position.  HENSELL: Bragen, you'd better explain that.  BRAGEN: If you're removed, who takes your place? The Deputy Governor, of course. And that's the real reason behind all this trouble, isn't it, Quinn?  HENSELL: Go on.  BRAGEN: You attack the Examiner in the mercury swamp and blame it on the rebels. Then you sabotage the radio and blame that on the rebels too.  HENSELL: Get him out of my sight!  QUINN: Hensell, before you listen to these preposterous allegations  (The guards drag Quinn out.)  HENSELL: I chose Quinn myself. I trained him for the job. Why, in a few years time, he'd have had this seat.  BRAGEN: Sometimes, Governor, a few years is a long time to wait.  HENSELL: Oh, Bragen?  BRAGEN: Governor?  HENSELL: You will assume Quinn's duties. As of now, you are Deputy Governor.
[Guest quarters]
(The Doctor uses a chair to smash the outer casing of a small electrical unit he's appropriated.)  BEN: I hope you know what you're doing.  DOCTOR: So do I. Excellent. excellent.  BEN: I thought we were after the Daleks, not this control unit you've nicked.  DOCTOR: If only we could find a. Ah, yes.  (Crossing to the bed, the Doctor pulls the mattress from the frame.)  BEN: He's a right little delinquent, isn't he?  POLLY: Doctor, what on Earth are you up to?  (The Doctor tugs at one of the metal cross straps on the bed frame until it comes loose.)  DOCTOR: Now we're really getting somewhere!  BEN: Look Doctor, I don't want to appear dim, but how's this going to do the Daleks in?  DOCTOR: They think that Lesterson's the driving force, but I don't. The Daleks are using him.  POLLY: But how?  DOCTOR: Problem. Smash the Daleks, and the people here will lock us up or kill us. Let the Daleks go, and we'll all be exterminated.  BEN: We could just go back to the Tardis. At least we'd be safe to think there.  DOCTOR: Oh yes, it's coming on.  BEN: Oh, you talk to him, will you?  POLLY: Doctor, look, if you told us what you were up to, perhaps we could help you.  DOCTOR: Mustn't underestimate any of them. Lesterson's a first class scientist, first class. He opened the capsule. He realised that the Daleks could be reactivated.  BEN: Yeah, that could be the answer. Let's kidnap Lesterson, and hide him away for a bit. Well, it would stop him bringing the Daleks back to life, wouldn't it? I thought it was pretty bright.  DOCTOR: There we are.  (The Doctor holds up the collection of parts he has assembled.)  BEN: What is it?  DOCTOR: What is it? It could be the answer to all our problems.
[Corridor]
(The Doctor, Ben and Polly see Quinn being escorted by a guard.)  QUINN: Ah, Examiner, don't let them fool you about the rebels. They're strong. Try and find out where they hold their meetings.  POLLY: Leave him alone!  QUINN: It's all right, Polly.  DOCTOR: We'll help him Polly, but later.  POLLY: Yes, but  DOCTOR: Now, this is a case where a little injustice is better than wholesale slaughter. What we want is in Lesterson's laboratory. Come along.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
LESTERSON: Incredible! Let's move on to test fourteen.  DALEK: I am ready.  LESTERSON: When sodium acts on ethyl alcohol, what is the resulting derivative?  DALEK: Sodium ethoxide. C2 H5 ONA.  LESTERSON: Just five seconds, Janley. Just the time it took to speak the answer.  JANLEY: It's right too.  LESTERSON: But of course it's right. Look, can you imagine what kind of positronic brain this robot has, Janley? Think of the store of knowledge that it must carry. Sulphuric acid.  DALEK: H2 SO4.  LESTERSON: Ah, you see?  DOCTOR: May I come in?  LESTERSON: What do you want?  DOCTOR: Oh, just to see how you're getting on.  LESTERSON: If you think  DOCTOR: No, please. I'm not here to cause trouble. I'm just interested, that's all.  LESTERSON: You've done nothing but meddle and interfere ever since you landed on Vulcan.  DOCTOR: Well, I did give you permission to open up the capsule, now didn't I? Oh please, carry on.  LESTERSON: And you won't try to stop me?  DOCTOR: Stop you? No, of course not. We got off on the wrong foot, Lesterson, but I'm a reasonable man, and I've been thinking perhaps I was hasty.  LESTERSON: Well, if you really want to call a truce.  DOCTOR: A truce? My dear fellow, I'd like to be friends.  LESTERSON: Yes. Yes, very well, you may stay.  DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Thank you.  (The Doctor hustles Ben and Polly out of the lab.)  DOCTOR: Perhaps you'd like to amuse yourselves for a little while.  (On the other side of the room, Janley answers the communicator.)  JANLEY: Laboratory. Yes. All right. I can come now. Right.  (Janley picks up a cloth-wrapped bundle from the desk and conceals it behind her back.)  JANLEY: I just have to slip out for a few minutes, Lesterson, all right?  LESTERSON: Ah, yes, yes. Very well then, Examiner, shall we test its knowledge of physics?  DOCTOR: Oh, splendid, splendid. Please, please, carry on.  LESTERSON: Thank you. What is the First Law of Thermodynamics?  DALEK: When heat is transformed into any other kind of energy or vice versa, the total quantity of energy remains invariable.  (As the Dalek gives the answer, the Doctor slips the modified control unit from his pocket and connects it to the generator.)  DALEK: That is to say, the quantity of heat which disappears is equivalent to the quantity of other kind of energy produced.  (The Doctor activates his device and the Dalek begins to spin helplessly, its eye and sucker sticks twitching uncontrollably.)  LESTERSON: You fool! What do you think you're doing?  DOCTOR: I'm saving your life!  (Lesterson smashes the control unit and pushes the Doctor towards the doors.)  LESTERSON: Get out! Get out!  DALEK: I have sustained no damage.  (The Dalek swings round to watch the Doctor leave, the mechanism behind its empty gun-socket clicking in useless frustration.)
[Governor's office]
JANLEY: It's all right. It's been done.  BRAGEN: You were able to get away then?  JANLEY: Yes. Lesterson's with the Examiner. And Hensell?  BRAGEN: At a meeting of production managers. He left me in control.  JANLEY: We could take over the colony now.  BRAGEN: No. No, it has to be absolutely right. I don't want to take over a colony full of rebels do I, Janley?  JANLEY: I don't know. You're making me help them.  BRAGEN: Only to stir them up to create enough trouble to get rid of Hensell, and then, then we crush them. The whole colony will be grateful, and I'll be Governor.  (Janley unwraps the bundle.)  BRAGEN: Is that the gun you told me of? Can you persuade the rebels this will help them?  JANLEY: Yes, Valmar thinks he can work in a switch to turn it on and off.  BRAGEN: How powerful is it?  JANLEY: It killed Resno, Lesterson's assistant. Lesterson believes that Resno's simply shaken up, taking a few days off.  BRAGEN: And the body?  JANLEY: In the mercury swamp. Lesterson was the indirect cause of Resno's death. It's a good hold over him if he makes trouble. I'll give this to Valmar then?  BRAGEN: Yes.  JANLEY: When do we move?  BRAGEN: I need another card in my hand. The Examiner bothers me.  JANLEY: I thought Quinn was the danger.  BRAGEN: Not any more. The Examiner's no fool. No, there has to be something else.
[Corridor]
(A little later, Ben and Polly are searching for the Doctor.)  POLLY: Well?  BEN: Well, he's not in the laboratory. Lesterson's by himself.  POLLY: Hmm. He must have gone another way. Can I leave it you? I'm going to go back to the rest room.  BEN: But  POLLY: Somebody's got to clear it up.  BEN: Okay.  (Ben leaves. Janley appears.)  JANLEY: Hello there.  POLLY: Hello. You're Lesterson's assistant aren't you?  JANLEY: Yes. You're not looking for the Examiner, are you?  POLLY: Well, do you know where he is?  JANLEY: Yes, he's waiting to get a message through from Earth. He's in the Communications room.  POLLY: Erm.  JANLEY: Oh, you'll find it easy enough. Look. Around, then to your right, in the next block.  POLLY: Thanks very much.  (Janley follows Polly at a short distance.)
[Communications room]
POLLY: Doctor? Anyone here?  (A technician looms from the shadows and grabs Polly, putting his hand over her mouth.)  JANLEY: Well done, Valmar.  (Janley breaks a phial into a handkerchief.)  JANLEY: Hold her. Hold her.  (With the handkerchief over her nose and mouth, Polly sags unconscious in Valmar's arms.)  JANLEY: There, that'll keep her quiet for a bit.  VALMAR: I've no idea who she is. She was just snooping around.  JANLEY: I sent her. We want her kept out of the way. Get a couple of your men to keep her in a safe place. Now, this is what I told you about.  VALMAR: Yes. The lethal power must come from here.  JANLEY: Uh huh.  VALMAR: It should have quite a good range.  JANLEY: Can you fix it?  VALMAR: It's easy. This could win us the revolution.
[Guest quarters]
(The Doctor is stretched out on the bed, playing his recorder.)  BEN: She said she was coming back here. She knew the way, and she wouldn't have wandered off. I know she wouldn't! Oh!  DOCTOR: Ben, if you were a Dalek, what would be your next move?  BEN: I'm talking about Polly.  DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. She's a clever girl, but she couldn't answer this.  BEN: But she is missing!  DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no.  BEN: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!  DOCTOR: No, no, no! She's looking around. There's a lot to see in the colony. She's interested. I like that.  BEN: Come on.  DOCTOR: Where are we going?  BEN: To report it. If we make a fool of ourselves, I don't care. We report it!
[Lesterson's laboratory]
LESTERSON: Yes, yes, yes. I managed to stop that fool of an Examiner just in time. You know, there are some people here who believe that you're an enemy.  DALEK: I am your servant. What does this machine do?  LESTERSON: You know, it's amazing. You have an almost human interest and curiosity.  DALEK: A Dalek is bet, is not the same as a human. If I am to help, I must know everything.  LESTERSON: Yes. Yes, of course.  DALEK: What is this machine?  LESTERSON: It computes meteorite storms as they approach our weather satellites.  DALEK: How accurate is it?  LESTERSON: About seventy percent. It helps to cut down on our satellite losses.  DALEK: Daleks can build computers with one hundred percent accuracy.  LESTERSON: One hundred percent?  DALEK: If you provide materials and our own power unit, a computer will be built.  LESTERSON: A hundred percent? But that would be an enormous saving for the for the colony.  DALEK: Then you will get the materials?  LESTERSON: I'll go and speak to the Governor at once.  DALEK: I will be ready to dictate the blueprint when you return.  LESTERSON: Oh, that's marvellous.  (Lesterson leaves. The Dalek moves to the generator and adjusts a control. As the power rises, the Dalek glides inside the capsule.)
[Corridor]
(Ben realises the Doctor is lagging behind.)  BEN: You agreed we'd go and see Bragen.  DOCTOR: Hmm? Power.  BEN: Come on then!  DOCTOR: Now the energy intake for Daleks should be the cube  (The Doctor rips a notice from the notice board, and starts scribbling on the back.)  DOCTOR: Now then, twenty two over three. Nineteen times  BEN: Well, now what are you at? Talk to yourself.  DOCTOR: Oh, it's useless with incomplete data!  (The Doctor smoothes the notice flat again and pins it back on the board. Then he ducks out of sight.)  DOCTOR: Lesterson!  BEN: Eh?  DOCTOR: He just went past. That means we can get into his laboratory again.  BEN: But we're looking for  DOCTOR: Oh, come along, Ben. Come along.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(The Doctor sees a thick cable stretching from the power unit into the capsule.)  BEN: There's somebody in there.  DALEK: What are you doing here?  DOCTOR: Stand aside. Servants shouldn't question.  DALEK: Entry is restricted.  DOCTOR: Not for me it isn't. Accord every access. I've got a badge.  DALEK: That is an order.  DOCTOR: A Dalek order. Short circuit the generator, Ben.  DALEK: Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Stand back!  DOCTOR: Don't be frightened of it, Ben. It's not armed. I'm going to see what it was doing in there.  (The Doctor stops as two armed Daleks glide from the capsule.)  DOCTOR: Ben?  BEN: What?  DOCTOR: Let's get out of here.  BEN: The fool. Lesterson must have reactivated them.  DOCTOR: Yes. When I say run, run like a rabbit. Run!  (The Doctor and Ben dash the lab.)  DALEK: I have sent the human being for materials.  DALEK 2: And power?  DALEK: Yes. Power we can turn into static. Then we will conquer.  DALEKS: We will conquer. We will conquer. We will conquer.
[Governor's office]
DOCTOR: But if you didn't do it, Lesterson, then the Dalek must have used your power supply and reactivated the others itself.  LESTERSON: I was going to do that anyway.  BEN: Are you off your head, mate? Those two are armed!  LESTERSON: Then we turn off the electricity, disarm them, and then everything is safe again.  DOCTOR: But I've already explained to you.  HENSELL: Stop these arguments, both of you. I've had enough. I've every confidence in Lesterson. He has carte blanche for the Daleks from now on.  DOCTOR: But they must be destroyed!  HENSELL: Bragen, I'm making a tour of the perimeter. I put you in direct charge here. See that Lesterson gets everything he wants, will you?  (Hensell leaves.)  LESTERSON: I shall need a permanent guard on my laboratory, Bragen.  DOCTOR: Huh.  (The Doctor leaves, followed by Ben.)  BRAGEN: Don't worry about the Examiner. I think I can keep him quiet.
[Guest quarters]
BEN: We've been forgetting about Polly.  DOCTOR: Greed and ambition, that's all it is. Wait till they find out what their precious production figures have cost them!  (Bragen enters.)  BEN: Oh, I want to see you.  BRAGEN: What about?  BEN: Well it's Polly, she's missing. We can't find her anywhere.  (The Doctor starts playing his recorder.)  BRAGEN: I'll tell one of my men to make enquiries. It shouldn't take long to find her.  BEN: Ah, thanks.  BRAGEN: Examiner, some of my men have found a body in the mercury swamp. It was the body of a middle-aged man.  DOCTOR: What is that to do with me?  BRAGEN: You're the Examiner. Or maybe you're not.  DOCTOR: Just exactly what do you mean by that?  BRAGEN: Who are you? Quinn's friends come to stir up rebellion?  DOCTOR: There's only one possible way that you could know I'm not the Examiner.  BEN: Yeah, by knowing what the real Examiner looked like.  DOCTOR: Exactly, Ben. Exactly! Only two people knew of his arrival on this planet. Myself and his murderer.  BRAGEN: That's enough!  BEN: Is it? Doctor, we've got to tell the Governor.  BRAGEN: Do you think he'll believe you? I'll soon convince him that you murdered the man yourself. You stole the Examiner's badge.  DOCTOR: Then why don't you arrest us? Because there's a doubt isn't there? Because it might, it just might, go against you.  BRAGEN: All right, all right, so neither of us wants to make a move. But you leave Lesterson alone. And the Daleks!  (Bragen leaves.)  BEN: He'd make a right Father Christmas, wouldn't he?  DOCTOR: Oh, I'd rather fight a hundred of his sort than just one Dalek.  (An envelope is pushed under the door. Ben opens the door but the corridor is empty. Ben picks up the letter.)  BEN: Listen to this. The girl is safe. She will remain so as long as you leave the Daleks alone.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Two gun-sticks are on the bench.)  LESTERSON: And did you disarm the other two?  DALEK: Yes. We are your servants. We do not need guns.  LESTERSON: I'm very glad. I knew the Examiner was wrong about you.  DALEK: Did you get our materials?  LESTERSON: Yes. Everything you need you can have.  DALEK: And a power plant?  LESTERSON: Everything.  (The other two Daleks emerge from the capsule, both disarmed.)  DALEK: We will get our power.  DALEKS: We will get our power. We will get our power. We will get our power.
Episode Four
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(As the Daleks close in, Lesterson goes to the generator and cuts the power supply. Instantly, the Daleks movements become sluggish.)  DALEK: (slow) Turn back the power supply.  LESTERSON: I will, I will. But I want you to remember that I control you.  DALEK: We are your servants.  LESTERSON: I know. Remember it. I gave you each a special charge to bring you back to life. Any further power you need must come from this generator, and I control it. Is that clear?  DALEK: We obey.  (Lesterson returns the generator to full power. Two of the Daleks return to the capsule.)  LESTERSON: Where are they going?  DALEK: To await your orders, master.  LESTERSON: Good. Have you completed the blueprints for the meteor storm computer?  DALEK: It is ready.  (They go to a table.)  LESTERSON: Oh, it's marvellous! I'm glad we understand each other.  DALEK: We understand the human mind.
[Governor's office]
(Bragen is dressed in the uniform of a Deputy Governor now. Valmar is repairing the communications desk.)  BRAGEN: Isn't that finished yet?  VALMAR: Nearly. This is Valmar. Test call please.  (The communicator buzzes.)  VALMAR: Terrace. So I can hear you clearly all right, good. Now try and get in connection now with the interior, and then the perimeter stations. Well, no troubles now.  BRAGEN: About time. This work should have been completed long before this.  VALMAR: Well, I did the best I could.  BRAGEN: Well, it isn't good enough.  VALMAR: Then get someone else, Bragen.  BRAGEN: Be careful. I shall be watching you, Valmar, after this. Now get out.  (There's a commotion outside.)  BEN [OC]: See Bragen.  DOCTOR [OC]: Accord every access.  BRAGEN: What does this intrusion mean?  GUARD: I'm sorry, Bragen. I tried to stop them.  DOCTOR: Intrusion? It's no intrusion. We're just returning the various calls that you made. This guard tried to tell us you were busy. You're not a bit, are you?  BRAGEN: All right, I'll see them.  DOCTOR: Oh, what a nice new uniform. Very smart, very smart. I would like a hat like that.  BRAGEN: Well, what do you want?  BEN: Some joker has kidnapped Polly and sent us this note.  DOCTOR: Yes.  BEN: Well, we want to know what you're doing to find her.  BRAGEN: Now that the communications are restored we can start a search.  BEN: Yeah, I can just imagine what kind of job you'll make of that. Haven't you heard anything yet?  BRAGEN: The planet is a large one.  (A Dalek enters, carrying a drink on a tray.)  DOCTOR: So, they've given you the run of the colony, have they?  DALEK: We obey.  (The Doctor picks up a chair as if to defend himself.)  DALEK: Do I bring liquid for your visitors?  BRAGEN: No. They won't be staying much longer.  (The Dalek leaves.)  BEN: Look, Doctor, if he's not going to help us, we'll have to search for Polly ourselves.  BRAGEN: Sound advice. Why don't you, Doctor?  DOCTOR: Uh, uh. Examiner. I wonder how much longer they'll be able to move around on these floors?  BEN: Ay?  DOCTOR: The floors. They're not metal.  BEN: Doctor.  (The Doctor and Ben leave. The video communicator on the desk flashes on.)  HENSELL [on monitor]: Ah, there you are Bragen. Thank heavens the communications are working again. It's bad enough being stuck out here on the perimeter. Well? Your report, man. Hurry up. I've got a very full schedule.  BRAGEN: There is nothing to report, Governor.  HENSELL [on monitor]: The Examiner?  BRAGEN: I'm taking good care of him.  HENSELL [on monitor]: Good, you know my orders.  BRAGEN: Yes, sir.  HENSELL [on monitor]: All right. Well, you can reach me here if you have to, that's all.  BRAGEN: One moment, Governor. When will you be coming back?  HENSELL [on monitor]: Oh, not for a day or two at least. You can manage, can't you?  BRAGEN: Yes. Yes, of course, Governor.  (The Dalek has returned.)  BRAGEN: What do you want?  DALEK: Have you finished your liquid?  BRAGEN: No. No, I haven't.
[Corridor]
(Janley is pinning a new sign to the notice board. Moving on, she meets Kebble and sends him to the board.)  JANLEY: You'd better check the agenda.  KEBBLE: I'll do it now.  (Kebble hurries away as the Doctor and Ben approach.)  DOCTOR: Static, do you see. They need a constant supply of static from the floor. Some sort of electrical field.  (Ben sees Kebble leaving.)  BEN: Doctor. Why should he?  (Three Daleks go past.)  DOCTOR: It's madness!  BEN: What is?  DOCTOR: Letting them run around like this.  BEN: Hey, wait a minute. Bragen had one acting as a servant, and we've just left him.  DOCTOR: One Dalek in Bragen's office. Three Daleks just gone down the corridors. That makes four.  BEN: Where did the fourth one come from?  DOCTOR: Well, Lesterson can't have been making them. Perhaps there were more in the capsule than we thought.  BEN: We must go and see Lesterson. Yeah, and show him this note. Maybe he or Janley knows where Polly is.  (The Doctor gazes at the notice board. Kebble comes back then turns away again when he sees Ben.)  BEN: We frightened him off. I wonder what the fascination of this notice board is?  DOCTOR: It looks like a perfectly ordinary notice board to me.  BEN: Yeah, well, come on, Doctor. We must find out who's got Polly. Doctor, come on!  (The Doctor follows Ben. Kebble returns.)
[Lesterson's laboratory]
LESTERSON: Janley?  JANLEY: What is it?  LESTERSON: The Daleks. They've given me another list of materials they need.  JANLEY: Let me see. We've got all those things?  LESTERSON: Yes, but why these quantities, Janley? Why? How can they have used up all the materials I gave them? What is it? Why, it's only a matter of a few hours ago.  JANLEY: They're building new things for us.  LESTERSON: Yes, well, I don't want them to do anything without consulting me. What is it they do inside there?  JANLEY: You're worrying too much.  LESTERSON: Look, Janley, say what you like, but I'm beginning to believe that the Examiner is right about the Daleks. Their original thinking terrifies me. If we can control them, fine. But if not  JANLEY: Yes?  LESTERSON: Then I shall have them destroyed. It's too dangerous. The Examiner knows something about them that we don't. I'm going to ask his advice.  JANLEY: I wouldn't bring the Examiner into it if I were you.  LESTERSON: And why not?  JANLEY: You want him to find out about Resno?  LESTERSON: Oh, a little accident. How is he? Is he better?  JANLEY: He's dead.  LESTERSON: What are you talking about? You told me he was  JANLEY: You were busy with the experiments on the Daleks.  LESTERSON: But you should have told me. But the body? It'll have to be reported.  JANLEY: Don't worry, no one will find the body.  LESTERSON: Oh, Janley, you've done a terrible thing.  JANLEY: The experiments on the Daleks were more important.  LESTERSON: More important than human life? No, no, I won't accept that.  JANLEY: You will. You must. Your carelessness was the cause of Resno's death. You murdered him. It's only your word against mine.  LESTERSON: I won't be blackmailed by you.  JANLEY: All I want is for you to go on as you are. Scientific discovery can't stop dead, Lesterson.  (The Doctor and Ben enter.)  LESTERSON: I told the guard that no-one was to be allowed in.  DOCTOR: Accord every access, remember?  BEN: We're looking for Polly.  LESTERSON: Well, she isn't here, and I haven't seen her.  BEN: Well, she's been kidnapped.  LESTERSON: Oh, it sounds a little unlikely.  BEN: Oh, it does, does it? Well, we've got this note which tells us so.  LESTERSON: I'm very sorry, but I don't know anything about it.  DOCTOR: Lesterson?  LESTERSON: Yes?  DOCTOR: You haven't been building Daleks, have you?  LESTERSON: Building? No, I wouldn't know how to begin.  DOCTOR: And there were only three in the capsule?  LESTERSON: Yes.  DOCTOR: Well, we've just seen four. One in the Governor's office and three in the corridor.  LESTERSON: But that's not possible!  DOCTOR: There's only one explanation. The Daleks are reproducing themselves.  JANLEY: These things are machines. How could they reproduce?  DOCTOR: Machines? What makes you think they're just machines? The Daleks are brilliant engineers. Nothing is beyond them given the right materials.  LESTERSON: What?  DOCTOR: I said nothing is beyond them given the right materials.  LESTERSON: Oh.  DOCTOR: Lesterson, what's the matter?  LESTERSON: Oh.  JANLEY: Leave him alone. He's just been overworking, that's all.  BEN: Well, he looks bad.  JANLEY: Will you both go away. Guard! It's you, badgering him with questions. You've done nothing but hound him ever since you arrived on Vulcan. Bragen's orders were that no one was to be admitted.  GUARD: Yes, but I thought that the Examiner.  JANLEY: He attacked Lesterson. Get them out of here. Both of them.  BEN: He did not attack Lesterson!  JANLEY: Out, do you hear?  BEN: All right, all right.  (The guard leads the Doctor and Ben out. Janley uses the communications unit.)  JANLEY: Janley here. Tell Valmar to come over to the lab right away. Good. Now, it's all right. Come on. Rest here for a bit. There. You've been doing far too much.  (Janley gives Lesterson a glass of water.)  JANLEY: Shh.  (When Valmar arrives, Lesterson is fast asleep.)  JANLEY: I've sedated him.  VALMAR: Well, what's the matter with him?  JANLEY: Overwork, I suppose. He just suddenly broke up. Anyway, it'll give you a chance to lay in the new power cable the Daleks have asked for.  VALMAR: You don't miss a trick, do you?  (Janley goes to the Dalek capsule.)  JANLEY: We're going to lay in the new cables you wanted.  DALEK: Good.  VALMAR: You're sure this is okay, Janley?  JANLEY: Of course. We help them, they help us.  DALEK: Yes. We are your servants.  JANLEY: Don't take too long about it, Valmar. Oh, you saw the notice, did you?  VALMAR: I saw it.
[Corridor]
(Back at the notice board.)  BEN: Well, we're still no nearer finding Polly. What are we hanging about here for?  DOCTOR: Ben, I've found a message in code. It's an anagram, you just take the capital letters, see? Work it out yourself.  BEN: Oh, I can't do crosswords.  DOCTOR: Meeting tonight, 2000 hours. R O C K E T -- Rocket. R O O M - Room. P. Rocket Room P.  (The Doctor lets a Dalek go past.)  DOCTOR: It's the rebel's way of calling a meeting. Only tonight we're going to be there, early.  BEN: Yeah, maybe we're nearer finding Polly than I thought.
[Rocket room P]
(Later, the Doctor and Ben are hiding behind a pile of boxes.)  BEN: Ow. I've got pins and needles now.  DOCTOR: What's the time?  BEN: Time we went home.  DOCTOR: Yes.  (The rebels start filing into the room, taking their places around a large table. Valmar brings a Dalek in. Janley has a Dalek gun-stick attached to a control box. Valmar fastens the gun-stick to the Dalek. )  JANLEY: Now, we're going to demonstrate something. You section leaders can pass on what you've seen. So far, we've been concerned with testing the strength of the Governor with a few acts of sabotage. But now we're ready to take over.  KEBBLE: What is that thing? I've seen them moving about, but all we've been told is that it's a machine Lesterson discovered.  JANLEY: Valmar.  VALMAR: Lesterson removed the armaments of the Daleks he discovered. I've rearmed this one, but with a controlling device. We can regulate the fire power and turn it off and on whenever we choose.  JANLEY: Shall we have the demonstration now?  (A shadowy figure nods.)  BEN: That's the one we want. He must be the boss of this outfit.  JANLEY: This screen is two inch thick tungsten steel. Right, Valmar.  VALMAR: Fire at the screen.  (The metal screen is totally destroyed. Consternation.)  JANLEY: Quiet! You must keep quiet. We're too vulnerable here.  KEBBLE: But you can't control a thing like that. It'll turn on us.  JANLEY: No, it won't.  KEBBLE: I wouldn't let any of my group go anywhere near it.  VALMAR: I can control it.  KEBBLE: Prove it. Ah, you daren't! I'm not talking about that thing firing at the wall or bits of metal or anything. I mean people. Have you tested whether you can stop it from killing people? Our people?  VALMAR: Look, I can show you what I've done here.  KEBBLE: Forget it. How do you know a Dalek can tell the difference between the Governor's people and our people?  VALMAR: But I can tell the difference, you fool, and I control it.  KEBBLE: We want something better than words.  JANLEY: Test it on me. Will that satisfy you?  KEBBLE: Well yes, but  BEN: She's out of her mind.  (Valmar looks at the man in the shadows.)  VALMAR: Is it all right?  (The man agrees. Janley stands in front of the Dalek.)  VALMAR: Now, when I tell you to fire  DALEK: I am your servant.  (Valmar flicks a switch, and taps the Dalek on its dome. The weapon does no damage.)  JANLEY: Get back to your places.  KEBBLE: Are you all right?  JANLEY: Of course. I don't take needless risks.  VALMAR: Oh, well done, Janley.  JANLEY: You haven't disarmed the Dalek. Well, go on, take the gun away. We don't want any accidents. Now, what about the girl?  KEBBLE: We've got her safely locked up. Never fear.  JANLEY: I think the best thing for us to do is  BEN: Hear that? Maybe they'll say were she is.  (Ben sends a box crashing to the floor.)  JANLEY: Who's there?  BEN: You stay there, I'll distract them. Find out where Polly is.  JANLEY: No!  BEN: Help! Help!  (Ben runs out and Kebble grabs him and knocks him out.)  JANLEY: The guards will have heard that! Come on we've got to get out of here! Take him and lock him up! Quick! Out!  (Kebble and another man drag Ben away. Janley and the rebels follow, leaving the leader and the Dalek in the room.)  BRAGEN: You might as well come out. We know you're there.  (The Dalek goes to the Doctor's hiding place.)  DOCTOR: Bragen.  BRAGEN: Of course. Who else is fitted to be leader of the rebels?  DOCTOR: No doubt you want to be leader of the Daleks too.  BRAGEN: I am the leader of the Daleks.  DOCTOR: Well, see if you can stop this one from killing me.  BRAGEN: Stop! You heard me, that's an order. Turn away. Fetch the guard.  (The Dalek hesitates.)  DALEK: I obey.  DOCTOR: You hope to have it both ways, Bragen. But how will you look in front of the Governor, when I explain your dual role to him?  BRAGEN: The Governor will hardly listen to an impostor.  DOCTOR: An impostor? How do you propose to prove that?  BRAGEN: My guards are now going to produce the body of the real Examiner from the mercury swamp.  DOCTOR: The one you murdered.  BRAGEN: The one you pretended to be.  DOCTOR: Murder's a far worse crime than impersonation.  BRAGEN: Yes, but you can't prove I'm a murderer, while I can prove that you're an impostor.  (The Dalek returns with Janley and two guards.)  BRAGEN: Take this man away. Detain him.  (The guards escort the Doctor out.)  JANLEY: A dangerous man.  BRAGEN: Now the only one left is the Governor.  JANLEY: Perhaps we should have dealt with the Examiner earlier.  BRAGEN: I'll deal with him in time, and Quinn.
[Cell block]
(A guard uses a sonic key to open the cell next to Quinn, put the Doctor inside and relock it. The guards leave.)  QUINN: You're the last man I expected to see here.  DOCTOR: Hmm. Works by sound, does it?  QUINN: I'm speaking to you, Examiner.  DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry.  QUINN: If you'd listened to me in the first place, you wouldn't be locked up here now.  DOCTOR: Well, your imprisonment hasn't been entirely wasted. It's brought your enemy out into the open.  QUINN: Bragen? I've known that all along.  DOCTOR: Yes. But did you know that he was the leader of the rebels?  QUINN: Bragen, the leader?  DOCTOR: Yes. It's quite a simple sort of lock, really.  (The Doctor empties his pockets.)  QUINN: Hensell's trouble is he thinks he can run this colony on his personality alone.  DOCTOR: But even if he knew of the danger, could he do anything? The rebels are well organised.  QUINN: The Governor's popular. He can count on the mine workers at the perimeter for support.  DOCTOR: In that case we must get word to him.  QUINN: If you'd done your job properly, Examiner, you wouldn't be here now, and I'd have been out too.  DOCTOR: Ah yes, but then I'm not the real Examiner.  (The Doctor chooses a dog whistle from his collection.)  DOCTOR: Ben, Polly and I, we're just travellers, that's all. I found the Examiner dead. Bragen murdered him.  (The Doctor blows the high pitched whistle at the lock.)  QUINN: Everything leads back friend Bragen. Just give me a chance get my hands on him.  DOCTOR: We aren't going to have that chance unless we can get out of here.  QUINN: There's just a little matter of the cell doors.  (The doors don't open, but a dog starts barking outside.)
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Lesterson wakes. He gets a wet handkerchief and presses it to his face. A Dalek enters and he hides. It goes to the capsule and another Dalek comes out.)  DALEK 2: You sent for me?  DALEK: Take up a position at the communications room. Watch and report.  DALEK 2: I obey.  LESTERSON: They're conspiring together! Oh, why didn't I realise? The Examiner was right. They are evil!  (Two more Daleks come out of the capsule and all three leave.)  LESTERSON: There are four. They can't be reproducing!
[Capsule]
(Lesterson discovers a new section has been opened up, A corridor slopes down and away round a corner. Mechanical sounds echo from below. Lesterson goes through two doors to a small ante-room. Through a glass wall he sees a huge chamber with a long production line. At the far end, the lower half of a Dalek appears on the conveyor belt. It goes under an archway where mechanical arms reach in to do something then pull back. Then the casing is steam-cleaned and smothered in foam. Further along the belt it stops by a tank, where another Dalek nets a green tentacled creature and puts it into the casing where probes insert themselves into its body. Under a second archway, the Dalek receives it's dome. A final spray, and the machine comes to life. It leaves the conveyor belt for it's final check as another lower case has started it's journey at the far end.)  DALEK: Dalek nine complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  NEW DALEK: (under the count) We are the new race of Daleks.  DALEK: Dalek ten complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  DALEK: Dalek eleven complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  DALEK: Dalek twelve complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  DALEK: Dalek thirteen complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  DALEK: Dalek fourteen complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  DALEK: Dalek fifteen complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  DALEK: Dalek sixteen complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  DALEK: Dalek seventeen complete.  DALEK 2: Check.  DALEK: Dalek eighteen complete.
Episode Five
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Lesterson closes the capsule door, then drags a heavy cabinet in front of it. Janley enters.)  JANLEY: What's the matter? What is it? Are you ill?  LESTERSON: They're in there, making themselves! Duplicating!  JANLEY: What? What are you talking about?  LESTERSON: I started this, opening the capsule.  JANLEY: Lesterson!  LESTERSON: Don't try to stop me!  JANLEY: What happened?  (The generator is turned off.)  LESTERSON: They forget that I control them. I gave them life back again, and now I've taken it away. Finished it, stopped it.  JANLEY: The Daleks?  LESTERSON: Evil. Horrible. I know what I'm going to do. Laser torches. Melt them down. I'm going to melt the Daleks down to pools of metal.  JANLEY: You won't, Lesterson.  LESTERSON: Oh, do you think I care what you can do? Go on, tell everybody I was responsible for Resno's death. I don't care! I'm going to wipe out the Daleks! Yes, tell everybody all about me! I'm still going to I'm going to wipe out the Daleks!  (Janley leaves. Lesterson lifts the communications receiver.)  LESTERSON: Get me the Examiner. Prison? Who put him there? But I've got to talk to him! I've got to, don't you understand?  (The capsule door opens, pushing the cabinet aside. A Dalek moves up behind Lesterson.)  LESTERSON: How did you get there? I cut off the power.  DALEK: We can store power. We will soon have our own.  LESTERSON: Own power?  DALEK: Why was the capsule door closed?  LESTERSON: Own power! Argh!  (Lesterson flees. Another Dalek enters.)  DALEK: Seal off the capsule's secret entrance.  DALEK 2: I obey.  DALEK: Wait! No more than three Daleks to be seen together at any one time.  DALEK 2: I obey.  DALEK: We are not ready yet to teach these human beings the law of the Daleks.
[Corridor]
LESTERSON: You can help me!  GUARD: What's the matter?  LESTERSON: Where's the Examiner?  GUARD: The Examiner's in prison.  LESTERSON: Oh, yes.  GUARD: What's the matter with you?  LESTERSON: I forgot.  GUARD: What are you running for? Hey!
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Janley and Kebble take Polly to the laboratory. A Dalek comes from the capsule.)  JANLEY: Did Lesterson come back?  DALEK: No. Why is this human restricted?  JANLEY: She's against the Daleks. Afraid, are you? Nothing's going to happen to you if you behave.  POLLY: The Daleks? Of course I'm afraid, and so should you be.  JANLEY: The Daleks are going to help us.  POLLY: Us being the rebels, I suppose.  JANLEY: If you like.  POLLY: And when you've won, the Daleks will just go back to being servants again? You're bigger fools than I thought.  DALEK: We are your servants.  POLLY: While it suits you.  JANLEY: You'll see.  KEBBLE: In!  (Kebble pushes Polly into the capsule.)  KEBBLE: You want me to stay with her?  JANLEY: Yes. You may have to help Valmar. He'll be here in a minute to fix up the new Dalek power cable.  KEBBLE: Right.  DALEK: When will the work be completed?  JANLEY: What is this cable you Daleks are laying, anyway?  DALEK: Daleks operate on static electricity.  JANLEY: Static! Is that possible?  DALEK: To create static, the Daleks need a complete cable circuit.  JANLEY: I see. You convert our electricity into your own power.  DALEK: That is correct. When will the human being complete the work?  JANLEY: He'll be here. It's easier now. There's no-one to interfere with our plans.
[Cell block]
(The dog whistle has not done the trick so the Doctor is running a wet finger around the rim of a glass instead.)  QUINN: Do you have to do that? I'm afraid you'll find these locks are foolproof.  DOCTOR: I wonder how they're converting the power?  QUINN: What are you talking about?  DOCTOR: The Daleks. They're powered by static electricity. It's like blood to them, a constant life-stream.  QUINN: Static isn't workable.  DOCTOR: It is to the Daleks. They've conquered static, just as they've conquered anti-magnetics.  QUINN: I'm not going to listen to any more of this nonsense.  DOCTOR: I don't seem to be able to hit the right note. Do you have any more water?  QUINN: I hope not. No.  DOCTOR: Then I shall have to get some.  GUARD: You can't!  LESTERSON: But it's important! It's desperately important!  GUARD: Well, Bragen gave orders.  LESTERSON: Just get out of my way! Ah! Examiner! The Daleks !  DOCTOR: Yes?  LESTERSON: They're duplicating! I've seen them! They've got their own power now! I can't stop them!  GUARD: Take him to Bragen.  LESTERSON: Oh! Oh! Oh!  DOCTOR: I say. I say, do you think we might have a little more water?  QUINN: Is that all you can say? Lesterson fights his way down here to speak to you and all you can do is demand more water?  (The guard fetches a jug.)  GUARD: Get away from the door.  (The Doctor backs away and listens carefully to the tone of the sonic key. The guard puts down the jug, locks the door and leaves.)  QUINN: Sorry about that outburst. I thought it might help the situation.  (The Doctor adds a little more water to his glass.)  QUINN: Nearly, nearly.
[Governor's office]
(A Dalek is laying a cable around the room. Bragen is working at his desk when is brought in Lesterson under guard.)  BRAGEN: What's this?  GUARD: He tried to break in and speak with the Examiner.  LESTERSON: What is the Dalek doing?!  BRAGEN: I thought you knew. Something to do with the emergency power supply.  LESTERSON: Oh, no. It's a trick. I didn't ask for it.  BRAGEN: Lesterson, I've had reports.  LESTERSON: What are you doing?!  DALEK: Laying the new emergency power supply as you ordered, master.  LESTERSON: It's a lie!  BRAGEN: I've had reports of your incomprehensible behaviour.  LESTERSON: Yes. Yes, but I can explain if you'll get rid of that!  BRAGEN: Finish now.  DALEK: I am your servant.  (The Dalek leaves.)  LESTERSON: Where is the Governor?!  BRAGEN: At the perimeter. Why?  LESTERSON: Call him. Get him back here as quickly as possible. We're all in terrible danger! The Examiner was right! Right all the time!  (Janley enters.)  LESTERSON: Don't listen to anything she has to say.  JANLEY: Come along now.  LESTERSON: She's in league with the Daleks!  JANLEY: Now, now, now, now. Please, Lesterson. Just take things calmly. You're not well.  LESTERSON: I'm perfectly well!  JANLEY: Please, Lesterson, please. Now, you ought to be in hospital. You promised me you'd report there.  LESTERSON: I promised nothing of the kind.  JANLEY: Don't you remember? Never mind. I understand.  BRAGEN: Pity. It's probably only temporary.  LESTERSON: You're trying to say I'm mad.  BRAGEN: No, no, not mad.  JANLEY: No, of course not. No.  LESTERSON: But I tell you, I saw the Daleks. They were duplicating! I saw it! I swear to you!  JANLEY: He suddenly started saying these things in the lab. I'm afraid he's  LESTERSON: Oh, no! No!  BRAGEN: Keep him under restraint.  LESTERSON: Oh, will nobody listen to me?!
[Capsule]
(Polly sits on the floor, watching Valmar work on a power connector. A Dalek is watching them.)  VALMAR: Pass me that small screwdriver.  POLLY: I can't. My hands are tied. Anyway, I wouldn't help you even if I could.  VALMAR: Okay.  (Kebble appears with more cable.)  VALMAR: More? I can't handle them.  KEBBLE: This is the lot.  POLLY: Listen. The Dalek's gone now.  KEBBLE: That doesn't mean you can start talking.  VALMAR: Oh, leave her alone, Kebble. She isn't doing any harm.  POLLY: You think you're very tough don't you, pushing a girl around. I'd like to see you come up against a real man.  KEBBLE: Like who?  POLLY: Like Ben, for instance.  KEBBLE: Don't worry about him. We've got him safely stowed away.  POLLY: You've got Ben?  KEBBLE: He's sleeping off a slight fall.  VALMAR: I told you to leave her alone.  POLLY: Your name's Valmar, isn't it?  VALMAR: That's it.  POLLY: You want the Daleks to fight the Governor. But don't you see? They'll turn on you, too.  KEBBLE: What? Three big pepper pots?  VALMAR: One of them did kill Resno. And you saw what the Dalek did to that sheet of metal.  POLLY: And that's just the beginning.  KEBBLE: Don't listen to her. She's giving you the Examiner's line.  POLLY: He isn't the Examiner. We're just travellers, landed here by accident. The Doctor, that's the man you think is the Examiner, found the real Examiner dead and picked up his papers.  VALMAR: This Doctor of yours. He knows something about the Daleks?  POLLY: He's tried to warn everyone. It's the only reason we stayed here.  DALEK: When will the work be completed?  VALMAR: I don't know. I'll need a new junction box like this one.  (The Dalek leaves.)  POLLY: You've all underestimated these Daleks.  KEBBLE: Better brains than us, I suppose.  POLLY: I only know what the Doctor has told me. He says they're capable of exterminating whole nations.  VALMAR: Perhaps, but what would they want to kill us for, after we've taken over. We're friendly with the Daleks.  POLLY: But don't you see? Human beings can't be friends with Daleks. They don't have friends.  VALMAR: I don't see why not.  POLLY: It's a kind of hatred for anything unlike themselves. They think they're superior.  VALMAR: The girl's got something.  KEBBLE: You want to tell Janley, you're welcome.  POLLY: Janley! She'll betray the lot of you, if she gets the chance.  DALEK: The other junction box is outside.  VALMAR: Thank you.  KEBBLE: Talk too much, don't you? Didn't you know he was soft on Janley? All right, all right, I'm just putting her straight.  VALMAR: More slack on the cables.
[Corridor]
(A Dalek is laying a thick power cable along the wall. is draped over its sucker-stick. The Dalek detects the sounds of voices ahead. It turns back, and moves out of sight as two humans appear.)  HENSELL: What are all these cables lying about?  GUARD: New emergency power supply.  HENSELL: Who's idea was that?  GUARD: What do you want to know for?  HENSELL: What do I? Don't you know I'm the Governor? Where are you from?  GUARD: The interior, sir.  HENSELL: The interior? Why are you carrying a gun?  GUARD: I'm a Squad Leader in Bragen's guard, sir.  HENSELL: Oh, I see. Bragen's guard, ay? All right, carry on.
[Cell block]
GUARD: Cut that row out, you two.  (The Doctor plays his recorder as Quinn creeps out of his unlocked cell and pounces on the guard.)  GUARD: What the? Oh!  (Quinn knocks the guard out then unlocks the Doctor's cell.)  QUINN: Come on.  DOCTOR: Wait a minute.  (They lock the guard in the cell after the Doctor removes the jug and glass of water.)  DOCTOR: We don't want him trying it, although he seemed a bit tone deaf to me.
[Governor's office]
HENSELL: Well, Bragen, these trips are becoming more and more demanding.  BRAGEN: I didn't expect you, Governor.  HENSELL: Oh, I had as much as I could stand. Well, what's been happening here?  BRAGEN: One moment.  HENSELL: I asked you a question, man.  BRAGEN: I heard you.  HENSELL: Look, your work can wait. You can hand over to me tomorrow. I want to hear about the Examiner.  BRAGEN: The Examiner is at present in jail.  HENSELL: In jail? That's rather dangerous, isn't it? Who put him there?  BRAGEN: I did.  HENSELL: You did? In heaven's sake, why?  BRAGEN: He's an impostor, Governor. Possibly a murderer as well. We've just discovered the body of the real Examiner in the mercury swamp.  HENSELL: I hope you're sure of your facts, Bragen.  BRAGEN: Quite sure.  HENSELL: This could have far reaching consequences.  BRAGEN: As far as I am concerned, there's nothing more to be said. So if there's nothing further  HENSELL: Nothing further? Who the devil do you think you're talking to? Stand up when you're speaking to me, man!  BRAGEN: I prefer to remain seated.  HENSELL: Do you now? We'll soon see about that. Guards! Take this man out of my office. Did you hear what I said? That's an order!  BRAGEN: You forget, my dear Hensell. They're not your guards, they're mine.  HENSELL: I am the Governor.  BRAGEN: No. Not now. I am.  HENSELL: Oh, I see. Your guards, ay? Yes, Quinn warned me about your guards, but we all took them too lightly, didn't we? But we'll soon change that.  (Hensell moves to the door, but guards block his way.)  HENSELL: You imbecile! How long do you think your handful of guards can hang out when the people hear that I am being kept a prisoner in my own capital?  BRAGEN: The people will do exactly as they are told, Hensell. It will, of course, be easier for them if you co-operate with us.  (Bragen pushes a button on the desk, then motions for Hensell to take his seat. The Governor sits at his desk. Then a Dalek enters and stops next to Bragen.)  BRAGEN: Wait there. Guards, dismissed.  HENSELL: So, Bragen, you want my cooperation, do you?  BRAGEN: It would save bloodshed. I might even let you keep the title of Governor.  HENSELL: Might you now? I'll tell you what you will do. You'll order your guards to disarm and place yourself under arrest immediately!  BRAGEN: So you reject my offer. I thought it a generous one in the circumstances.  HENSELL: What circumstances?  BRAGEN: Look at this.  HENSELL: What is it?  (Bragen unwraps a Dalek gun-stick.)  BRAGEN: The reason that the colony is now mine.  (Bragen attaches the gun-stick to the Dalek.)  HENSELL: Is it a weapon of some kind?  BRAGEN: I'll arrange a demonstration for you. Do you still refuse my offer?  HENSELL: I will not be intimidated.  BRAGEN: Of course not. In character to the last, Hensell. Kill him!  (The Dalek obeys.)  DALEK: Why do human beings kill human beings?  BRAGEN: Get on with your work.  DALEK: Yes, master. I obey.  BRAGEN: Yes, obey me! From now on, I'll have complete obedience from everyone!
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(The Doctor and Quinn hide under a workbench. A Dalek comes out of the capsule, followed by Valmar.)  VALMAR: I'll have to check the cable circuit now. Otherwise it's just as you asked for.  DALEK: Very well.  VALMAR: Why can't you carry on with the power you're drawing from the colony? Why go to all this trouble?  DALEK: Until now, we have had to recharge from the colony supply. With static power, the Daleks will be twice as (pause) useful.  (Janley runs in.)  JANLEY: Valmar, quick!  VALMAR: What's the matter?  JANLEY: The Governor's back.  VALMAR: What about the girl?  JANLEY: Leave her.  DALEK: I will follow you.  VALMAR: What for?  DALEK: I am your servant.  JANLEY: Come on.  (Janley, Valmar and the Dalek leave. The Doctor and Quinn come out.)  DOCTOR: An electrical circuit of their own supplying static electricity! I wonder how much longer we've got?
[Capsule]
DOCTOR [OC]: I didn't realise they'd have a circuit of their own.  (Kebble picks up a wrench.)  POLLY: Doctor, look out!
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Quinn launches himself at Kebble, who feints and swings the wrench at Quinn's head. Quinn ducks and rolls to the workbench to get Lesterson's laser. He shoots Kebble in the hand and Kebble drops the wrench. Quinn knocks him out.)  POLLY: Are you all right?  DOCTOR: Well done! Who was the man who went outside just now?  POLLY: Valmar. He's been working for the Daleks.  DOCTOR: On their static power supply.  POLLY: Doctor, they've got Ben.  DOCTOR: Yes, I know. He ran away so that I could. Oh well, it's a long story. But don't worry, that boy can take care of himself.  QUINN: Did you hear that? That won't help.  DOCTOR: Get out, all of you!  QUINN: What about you?  POLLY: But Doctor!  DOCTOR: Go!  (Polly and Quinn and Polly run out into the corridor. The Doctor picks up the wrench and follows, slamming the lab doors behind him and jamming the wrench through the handles. The Dalek cannot follow.)  DALEK 2: Have they escaped?  DALEK: Yes, return to capsule and report.  DALEK 2: I obey.  (The Dalek fires its gun at the door. The door buckles and gives way, and the Dalek leaves.)
[Capsule]
DALEK: We are to wait here until the human beings fight among themselves.  DALEK 2: Then we will strike.  DALEK: And exterminate!  ALL DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
[Governor's office]
(The Doctor, Quinn and Polly discover Hensall's body.)  QUINN: The one man who could have saved us.  DOCTOR: Don't worry. The people will follow you, too.  QUINN: Maybe. But there wasn't any maybe about Hensell. He was old-fashioned, single-minded, yes, but he's done a lot of wonderful work for this colony. Events turned out against him, that's all. But why? Why was he killed?  BRAGEN: I can answer that.  (Bragen is flanked by armed guards.)  BRAGEN: He wanted to destroy the Daleks, so one of them killed him. Now I'm declaring martial law. You will be returned to prison and properly guarded this time.  DOCTOR: Martial law? What good do you think that will do against the Daleks?  BRAGEN: The Daleks will do as I tell them.  DOCTOR: We shall see, shan't we.  BRAGEN: Take them away.  (Bragen has the corpse removed.)

ALL DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!  DALEK 2: Orders received. Exterminate all humans!  DALEK: Exterminate all humans!  DALEK 2: Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy!

Episode Six
[Lesterson's laboratory]
DALEK: Take up positions, ready to exterminate all human beings.  DALEK 3: Exterminate!  ALL DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
[Corridor]
(Two guards are escorting the Doctor, Polly and Quinn to the detention area. The Doctor stops. A Dalek has taken up position ahead of them.)  GUARD: Move on!  DOCTOR: The Dalek!  POLLY: What about it?  DOCTOR: Can't you see it's armed?  GUARD: Keep moving!  (The Dalek bars their way.)  DALEK: This area is restricted.  QUINN: On whose authority?  GUARD: Silence!  DALEK: Repeat. This area is restricted.  (Another Dalek appears behind them.)  DALEK 2: Obey or you shall be exterminated.  QUINN: I thought they obeyed us?  POLLY: What do we do now, Doctor?  QUINN: This way.  (The Doctor and Polly follow Quinn, with the guards following.)  DALEK: They will be exterminated.
[Governor's office]
JANLEY: We've won. The revolution's over. I'll pass the word to Valmar, Kebble and the rest.  BRAGEN: Wait. The revolution is not quite over yet.  JANLEY: What more can we do? Hensell's dead, you're the new Governor. The battle's over.  BRAGEN: Not quite. You mentioned Kebble, Valmar and that rabble. Well, now they must be dealt with.  JANLEY: But those are our own men.  BRAGEN: Of course.  JANLEY: I don't understand.  BRAGEN: Do you think I can ever be secure in that chair while that rabble are still loose? They rebelled against Hensell yesterday. Tomorrow it'll be my turn. Well, let them rebel. Tell them the guards have taken control. Let them attack, and then we can crush them utterly.  JANLEY: You say we.  BRAGEN: Yes. We've come a long way together, you and I. Are you going to back down now?  JANLEY: Couldn't you just arrest them?  BRAGEN: Everyone must be killed.  JANLEY: Must they all be slaughtered?  BRAGEN: All of them.  (Behind Janley, Bragen reaches into a drawer and gets a pistol.)  BRAGEN: Well, are you still with me?  JANLEY: I suppose so.  BRAGEN: Then do as I say.  (Bragen lays the gun on the desk.)  BRAGEN: I'm glad you agreed with me.  (Valmar was outside and has overheard everything.)
[Corridor]
(The Doctor, Polly and Quinn now have a guard front and rear. An unarmed Dalek appears.)  DOCTOR: Now!  (Quinn takes out the rear guard. The other guard fires as they rush off, but misses them.)
[Guest quarters]
BEN: What have you brought me in here for?  VALMAR: Quiet!  BEN: Whose side are you on anyway?  VALMAR: I thought I was going to be on the winning side.  BEN: What changed your mind?  VALMAR: Bragen. The colony's become too small for him. He wants us out of the way now.  BEN: Yeah, well, it often happens that way, mate, when you follow blokes like him.  VALMAR: Look, I'm going to try and get your friends here, if I can. So wait here.
[Governor's office]
(The communications unit buzzes.)  GUARD [on monitor]: Section one reporting, Governor Bragen.  BRAGEN: Yes.  GUARD [on monitor]: The rebels are gathering. We've got them under observation.  BRAGEN: Don't let them concentrate in large groups. Hit them before they organise. They'll be making their move any time now.  GUARD [on monitor]: Right.  (Communication ends. Bragen looks over a document then makes a colony-wide broadcast.)  BRAGEN: People of Vulcan. This is your new Governor talking to you. I have to announce that Governor Hensell has been murdered by the rebels. I have taken control temporarily until order is restored. People living on the perimeter and in the interior can stay calm. We know who the murderers are.
[Guest quarters]
BRAGEN [OC]: I shall keep you informed of events as soon as I am able, so listen for the signal to watch your communication sets. That is all.  (The Doctor, Polly and Quinn enter.)  DOCTOR: Ah! There you are.  POLLY: Ben!  DOCTOR: I knew you'd be all right!  BEN: Polly, you okay?  POLLY: Oh, yes.  BEN: Did Valmar find you, then?  POLLY: Valmar? No.  QUINN: What's this about Valmar?  BEN: Well it seems Bragen's gone power mad. He wants the rebels to revolt, then he can finish them off.  DOCTOR: The Daleks won't care who they fight. They'll exterminate every human being on this planet.  POLLY: Doctor, oh please, let's go back to the Tardis.  DOCTOR: Quinn, keep them both here.  BEN: Well, wait a minute, Doctor!  (Quinn blocks Ben's way.)  BEN: All right. All right.  QUINN: Now what do you think he's up to?  DALEK [OC]: Orders received. Daleks commence extermination.  ALL DALEKS [OC]: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
[Corridor]
(Gunfire is heard everywhere.)  KEBBLE: Just a minute, Examiner.  GUARD: All right, hold it!  (The Doctor drops to the floor.)  DOCTOR: Down everyone!  (A Dalek fires, killing one of the guards. A second guard returns fire but is also killed. The Doctor grabs Kebble and they run off. The Dalek follows.)
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(Valmar is connecting control wires to three Daleks.)  VALMAR: Don't come any nearer.  JANLEY: What do you mean?  VALMAR: I overheard your conversation with Bragen. But you can't stand up to the Daleks, so your plan will come to nothing.  JANLEY: Not my plan. Bragen's.  VALMAR: But that's the same thing.  JANLEY: Not any more.  VALMAR: You expect me to believe that?  JANLEY: Look, Val, he was going to kill me too. I came here to do exactly what you've done. Let Bragen see what the Daleks are like. He doesn't know how strong they are. He's got to be stopped.  DALEK: You will lead us to the middle of your party of human beings.  VALMAR: Yes.  DALEK: We will fight (pause) for you.  JANLEY: Believe me, Val, it's the only way to save all our lives.  VALMAR: Did you know that the Daleks are duplicating?  JANLEY: Yes.  DALEK: But we are your friends.  DALEK 2: We will serve you.  DALEK 3: Take us to the centre of your group.  VALMAR: Can we trust them?  JANLEY: We must! The guards have orders to wipe us out. We must use the Daleks. Come on.
[Guest quarters]
(Kebble has gone.)  POLLY: Doctor!  DOCTOR: The window. Does it open?  BEN: I don't know.  DOCTOR: It had better, or we're done for! Out you go.  POLLY: What's happening?  DOCTOR: The Daleks. They're teeming all over the corridors. We've got to get back to Lesterson's lab.  (Kebble appears in the doorway and is shot in the back by a Dalek. The Doctor gets through the window just as a Dalek enters.)
[Governor's office]
BRAGEN: This is Governor Bragen speaking. A group of rebels is attempting to take over the colony. It is the duty of all loyal citizens to help the guards resist. Stay in your homes. Order will be restored. Listen to my bulletins.  GUARD: The rebels are using the Daleks against our people!  BRAGEN: Well, get back and fight! Why do you come running to me? What do you think your guns are for?  GUARD: Well, the guns don't work against them!  BRAGEN: Get back and fight them!
[Corridor]
(The rebels have constructed a barricade of boxes. They are shooting at a group of Bragen's guards when Janley and Valmar with their controlled Daleks.)  JANLEY: There and there!  (The Dalek fires at the guards.)  JANLEY: Over there! No! No! Over there! They're our people!  VALMAR: Cut the Dalek gun off!  JANLEY: No!  (Janley deactivates the control device but the Dalek fires on the rebels.)  VALMAR: I told you to cut the gun off!  JANLEY: I did!  VALMAR: You've killed our own people!  VALMAR: We have to dismantle the gun, that's all.  JANLEY: Oh, look at it!  DALEK: Your usefulness is over.  (A guard appears, firing at the Dalek.)  JANLEY: Come on! Quick, Val. Come on!
[Lesterson's laboratory]
POLLY: Doctor, it's stupid to hide in here!  BEN: Well, do you fancy your chances outside in the corridor? No thanks.  DOCTOR: The answer must be here somewhere.  LESTERSON: Shh!  (Hearing Daleks coming from the capsule, Lesterson hides everyone under the workbench.)  LESTERSON: You must be absolutely quiet. They know everything that's going on. Everything! They even know what you're thinking.  BEN: Where do they get their power from, Lesterson?  LESTERSON: Ah, I tried to turn the power off, but they were miles ahead of me. Marvellous creatures. You have to admire them.  BEN: But we've got to stop them!  LESTERSON: Oh, it's too late for that. They're the new species, you see, taking over from homo sapiens. Man's had his day. Finished now.  DALEK: The static circuit is nearly complete.  DALEK 2: Soon we can abandon the power we are using.  (Screams outside.)  DALEK: The humans are being exterminated.  (The two Daleks go into the capsule.)  BEN: Did you hear that? They're going to use their own power.  DOCTOR: The cables they laid. The trick I tried before won't work anymore.  LESTERSON: Oh, if that's no good now, we're finished. All we can do is marvel at the creatures who are taking our place.
[Corridor]
VALMAR: No!  JANLEY: Come on!  VALMAR: Don't be a fool.  JANLEY: Come on!  (Quinn pulls Valmar to safety as a Dalek appears ahead. Janley shoots at it, but of course she dies.)
[Lesterson's laboratory]
BEN: Take it easy, Polly.  POLLY: Can't we do anything?! They're murdering everybody, one by one!  BEN: You've done all this. Why'd you give them power in the first place?  LESTERSON: Well, I could control it, you see. And then Janley got one of her men, Valmar, I think it was, yes, and he rigged up a secret cable. It's carrying power directly from the colony's supply.  DOCTOR: Where? Where is it, Lesterson?  LESTERSON: Valmar's the only one who can answer that. Or the Daleks of course. They know everything. Yes, you should ask the Daleks.  BEN: Then we must find Valmar.  DOCTOR: No. You stay here and look after Polly. I'll go.  MAN [OC]: Come on. This way. (scream)  (The Doctor uses the diversion of two guards fighting a Dalek to get away down the corridor. A woman tries to enter the lab, but is killed in the doorway. Her companion tries to wrestle the Dalek, with the usual result.)
[Corridor]
(Valmar holds Janley's body, and cries.)  QUINN: You'll have to leave her now, Valmar.  VALMAR: She wasn't as bad as you think.  DOCTOR: Valmar! Where is the Dalek power?  QUINN: Get down, both of you!  (As they play dead, a Dalek glides past them looking for signs of life, and moves on.)  DOCTOR: Valmar. Valmar! Where is the Dalek power supply?  QUINN: We've got to stop them, Valmar. She's dead. There's nothing you can do for her.  VALMAR: The main cable's inside the capsule, but there's nothing you can do.  QUINN: There must be some way of cutting off the power!  DOCTOR: What makes you think I want to do that? We need more time. I know. A diversion. Bragen's guards. We'll have to use them to keep the Daleks busy. You go to Bragen.
[Governor's office]
BRAGEN: Section One, where's your report? Are you there, Section one? Section two? Section two? Why don't they answer? Can you hear me, Section two? Section three? Oh, why don't they answer? I'm their Governor. Why don't they answer?
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(The colony is silent as the grave as the Daleks look for survivors.)  BRAGEN [OC]: This is Bragen speaking. I'm speaking to the Daleks. Daleks, listen to me. I am the Governor. You must work for me. Do not trust the rebels. I will give you whatever you want, but immobilise your guns. This is the Governor speaking.  BEN: He's nuts, trying to talk to the Daleks.  (More Daleks leave the capsule and go out into the corridor.)  BEN: Lesterson, what's in that cupboard?  LESTERSON: Nothing. It's quite empty.  BEN: Well, come on, Polly, we'll be safe in there, love.  (Ben and Polly hide in the cupboard while Lesterson stays underneath the bench.)

BRAGEN: Do you hear me, Daleks?! You will obey my orders!  QUINN: No use, Bragen. The Daleks have stopped obeying your orders.  BRAGEN: Guards!  QUINN: Dead! The Daleks have killed them. You still have your guard units in the interior. How long will it take them to get here?  BRAGEN: That depends.  QUINN: Well, get them!  BRAGEN: Well, they will be intercepted by the Daleks.  QUINN: Exactly! It will draw them away from here and give the Doctor a chance to deal with them.  BRAGEN: I refuse to allow my guards to be sacrificed.  QUINN: In that case the Daleks will destroy everything on this colony.  (Bragen switches on the communications unit.)  BRAGEN: Guards. This is Bragen speaking. All units will report immediately to the capital. Be prepared to face the rebel Daleks. There. Are you satisfied?  QUINN: I hope it works.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
(The Doctor returns with Valmar.)  DOCTOR: Ben! Polly!  (Ben and Polly come out of the cupboard.)  BEN: Doctor, did you hear what Bragen said?  DOCTOR: Yes, I did.  BEN: Well, I only hope the Daleks do go for the guards.  POLLY: A lot of the Daleks went out just now.  DOCTOR: Good, because we're going inside. Come on, Valmar.  (The Doctor and Valmar go into the capsule and come out with a junction box connected to a lot of cables.)  DOCTOR: Ben, give us that spare cable over there. Polly, keep watch at the door.  BEN: Well, you know what you're doing?  DOCTOR: Of course I do.  BEN: Well, why can't you just take all the plugs out and cut the power off?  DOCTOR: Because I prefer to do it my way!  POLLY: Look out!  (Everyone takes cover as a Dalek enters. Valmar goes into the capsule with the modified junction box, just missing another Dalek coming out.)  DALEK 2: Static power is being stored. We can dismantle the human electric system.  (The Doctor starts to edge his way round the room.)  DALEK: The law of the Daleks is in force.  DALEK 2: Extermination of humans.  (Lesterson stands up.)  DALEK: Our cables have been moved.  LESTERSON: And I could tell you who did it.  DALEK: What were you doing in there?  LESTERSON: I want to help you.  DALEK: Why?  LESTERSON: (like a Dalek) I am your servant.  DALEK: We do not need humans now.  LESTERSON: Ah, but you wouldn't kill me. I gave you life.  DALEK: Yes, you gave us life.  (So the Dalek kills him. The Doctor plugs his cable into the generator. Nothing happens. The Daleks spot Valmar and turn, while the Doctor pushes every button in sight. Valmar gets through the door just before the Daleks shoot. Ben pulls Polly out of sight. There's an explosion and the Doctor is knocked down. The Daleks lose control, lights flashing and smoke coming from their casings. One powers into the wall and the other bursts into flames.)
[Colony]
(Everywhere Daleks are affected by the power surge.)  DALEK 2: There are two  DALEK: Exterminate! Ah! Ah! Exterminate!  (The corridors fill with smoke from exploding Daleks.)  DALEK: Out of control! Out of Control!  (In the capsule the machinery goes haywire and explosions rip through it.)
[Governor's office]
(A Dalek enters, but its dome blows off before it can shoot at them.)  BRAGEN: What happened to it?  QUINN: I don't know.  BRAGEN: It seems that your friend, the Examiner, was successful after all.  (Quinn relaxes, and Bragen gets the gun off him.)  BRAGEN: Now I shall restore law and order on this planet.  QUINN: Not your law, Bragen. That's finished for good.  BRAGEN: You'll obey me, or  QUINN: Your day is over, Bragen. No one will obey you now.  BRAGEN: I'm still the Governor, and you will. Valmar!  (A shot rings out, but it is Bragen who falls dead.)  VALMAR: He was a murderer.  QUINN: Enough of guns. There's a lot of clearing up to be done. We will rebuild together. What is the extent of the damage?  VALMAR: Oh, I don't know if its repairable. The whole electrical system.
[Lesterson's laboratory]
QUINN: Are you all right?  BEN: Oh, he's okay. The clot knocked himself out.  QUINN: It's a miracle. How did you do it?  DOCTOR: Eh? What happened? What did I do? What did I do?  BEN: You destroyed the Daleks, that's what you did.  POLLY: No need to be modest about it.  DOCTOR: Did I do that?  POLLY: You know you did.  VALMAR: You used the power from the colony's electric supply, overfed it and blew up their temporary static circuit. Well, didn't you?  DOCTOR: Did I do all that?  VALMAR: You may have stopped the Daleks, but have you any idea of the damage you've done to the colony?  DOCTOR: Oh. There was a blow back, was there?  VALMAR: A blow back? Our power supply has been destroyed! It'll be months before we can get things back to normal.  QUINN: Valmar!  DOCTOR: Oh, that is unfortunate.  VALMAR: But did it have to be this way?  DOCTOR: I did a lot of damage, did I?  QUINN: Come on.  (Valmar and Quinn go to check the capsule.)  DOCTOR: I think we'd better get out of here before they send us the bill.
[Mercury swamp]
(The Doctor and his companions walk to the Tardis. The Doctor is playing his recorder.)  BEN: Well, I mean I didn't expect the brass bands to be playing, but I wouldn't have thought a thank you would have hurt anybody.  POLLY: But Ben, think of all those poor people all killed.  BEN: I know, but the Doctor saved the colony from being completely wiped out.  POLLY: Hmm.  BEN: Yeah, and he was telling them all along, but would they listen?  POLLY: Mind you, he wasn't very convincing when he was trying to explain it to Valmar and Quinn and everybody.  BEN: No, he wasn't, was he?  POLLY: Doctor, you did know what you were doing, didn't you?  (The Doctor just chuckles and gives Polly a wink. There is a Dalek next to the Tardis, its casing melted and scorched.)  BEN: Oh, you needn't worry about them anymore, Doctor. Just a heap of old iron now.  (Ben taps the Dalek casing and they all go into the Tardis. Moments later it dematerialises and the Dalek's eye-stalk lifts as if to watch.)

[Culloden moor]

(1746. Scottish Highland clans, loyal to Bonnie Prince Charles Edward, battle with the English and German regiments loyal to the English monarch, King George. Finally overpowered by superior forces, the Highlanders break ranks and leave the battlefield. The leader of Clan McLaren, Colin, is badly injured. His son Alexander, daughter Kirsty and a young piper called Jamie McCrimmon, accompany him. Confronted on the path by two Redcoats, Alexander engages the soldiers in a sword fight. He kills one Redcoat and the other flees, allowing the small group to move on seeking refuge. The Tardis materialises in small hollow, concealed from view by bushes and brambles. Ben comes out, followed by Polly and the Doctor.) 
POLLY: It's so cool. 
BEN: Hey, Polly. 
POLLY: What? 
BEN: Where does this remind you of? 
POLLY: Oh, it's cold and damp. 
BEN: No, where does it remind you of? 
POLLY: Ouch! Prickles! What? 
BEN: Where else could it be? We're home, Duchess! 
POLLY: Oh, you never give up hope, do you? We'll ask the Doctor. Hey, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Listen. 
(There's an explosion in the distance.) 
BEN: It sounds like the cup final. 
(Something whistles towards them, fast.) 
POLLY: Look out! 
(Ben and Polly throw themselves to the ground as the something goes Boom nearby. The Doctor hides in the brambles, hands over his head.) 
DOCTOR: What are you doing down there? 
BEN: What was it? It looks like an old-time cannon ball. Ow! It's hot. 
DOCTOR: Allow me. Yes, a ten pounder. That does it. 
POLLY: But Doctor, we can't leave. This looks like England. 
BEN: Yeah, I'm going to look over that hill. 
POLLY: Doctor, you don't want us to think you're afraid, do you? 
DOCTOR: Why not? 
POLLY: Look, we can't let Ben go up there on his own. We don't know what he's going to find. Come on.

[Cottage]

(In a ruined cottage, Kirsty is tending her father's wounds.) 
COLIN: Ahh, Kirsty. Ahh. 
KIRSTY: He badly needs a doctor.
(Everyone say Hi to Hannah Gordon.) 
ALEXANDER: Aye, and food. 
COLIN: Water. Water. 
KIRSTY: Whist, father. 
ALEXANDER: Water. Water. 
JAMIE: There's a wee drop left yet. 
(Everyone say Hi! to handsome young Fraser Hines as the McLaren drinks from the canteen and Jamie looks at the remaining piece of his bagpipes - the chanter.) 
COLIN: The battle. The battle! 
ALEXANDER: It's done. The clans are broken, shot to pieces by the English guns. Never had the chance to get to within claymore's length of them. 
COLIN: Ah, the slaughter. 
(Jamie starts to play.) 
ALEXANDER: Whist! Do you want to bring the redcoats upon us? 
JAMIE: They'll be here soon enough, have no fear. 
COLIN: The Prince? 
JAMIE: Dinna fash yourself. He was the first to leave the field. 
ALEXANDER: What's that you say about the Prince? 
COLIN: Ah stay, the pair of you. Why didn't you leave me to die on the field? 
ALEXANDER: You're the Laird himself. 
COLIN: The Laird of what? All the men of our clan are lying in the mud of the Culloden Moor. Oh, I should be with them. Oh, Kirsty, my Kirsty. 
ALEXANDER: We may not be long joining them. The English troops are butchering all their wounded and hanging all their prisoners. 
JAMIE: They canna hang us all, can they? 
ALEXANDER: They'll never hang me, piper. You may be sure of that. 
(Alexander sees movement outside) 
ALEXANDER: Whist! 
KIRSTY: The English? 
ALEXANDER: There is but three of them. 
JAMIE: They're not soldiers. 
COLIN: Our people? 
ALEXANDER: Well, I'll find out. Jamie, at the rear. You gang that way. Wait my signal.

[Near the cottage]

(Jamie and Alexander set off in opposite directions to circle round. Ben spots an abandoned field gun.) 
BEN: Hey, look! This must be where that cannon ball came from. 
DOCTOR: It's unlikely. 
BEN: What do you mean it's unlikely? 
DOCTOR: It's been spiked. 
BEN: Been what? 
DOCTOR: It's been spiked. 
(A long spike has been hammered down the barrel.) 
BEN: Well, how did you know? 
(The Doctor has spotted a bonnet with eagle feather and Jacobite cockade.) 
DOCTOR: I would like a hat like this. How do I look? 
POLLY: It's got words on it. With Charles our brave and merciful Prince Royal, we'll greatly fall or nobly save our country. 
DOCTOR: Bah. Romantic piffle. 
(The Doctor throws the bonnet to the ground.) 
ALEXANDER: You'll pick it up. 
(His claymore is at the Doctor's throat.) 
JAMIE: Careful, like. 
(Jamie has his dirk at Ben's chest. The Doctor picks up the bonnet.) 
ALEXANDER: This way with you. Quick! 
(The battle draws closer.)

[Cottage]

COLIN: We're going to awa' to the caves. 
KIRSTY: Father, you're in no fit state to travel. 
ALEXANDER: Kirsty! Get away with you. 
COLIN: Who are they? 
ALEXANDER: I know not. They're no Scot. They threw down the Prince's cockade. 
POLLY: Cockade? 
BEN: What Prince? 
DOCTOR: Prince Charles Edward. Bonnie Prince Charlie. 
ALEXANDER: You have the tongue. Aye, I thought so. English, the three of them. Camp followers to the Duke of Cumberland, come to steal from the dead. 
COLIN: Abide a moment! Do you wish to pray before you die? 
DOCTOR: Die? 
POLLY: Die for what? 
BEN: Well, you can't kill us in cold blood. 
JAMIE: Well, our bloods warm enough! Your English troopers gave no quarter to men, women and bairns. 
POLLY: Doctor, tell them who we are. 
KIRSTY: Doctor? 
ALEXANDER: Get away with you, woman. 
KIRSTY: We have need of a doctor. 
ALEXANDER: The Laird. 
COLIN: Get me a doctor. Get me a doctor. 
KIRSTY: Look, kill them after. Let them help the Laird first. 
ALEXANDER: We're not going to trust the Laird with these sassenachs, woman. 
(Ben dives forward and snatches a pistol from Colin's side.) 
KIRSTY: But if they can help him at all 
ALEXANDER: Kirsty, get away, will you. 
DOCTOR: Just think of the women. 
BEN: Right, back both of you! Or your Laird won't need a doctor. 
DOCTOR: Well done, Ben. And now, gentlemen. 
ALEXANDER: I'm warning you! 
DOCTOR: Your swords, I think. Ben, cock the pistol. 
KIRSTY: But why? Give them up! 
DOCTOR: Polly, take the swords. That's the style. Now, back against the wall, both of you. Go on! That's better. Now, I'm going to have a look at the wound. Come along, come along, let me see. Yes. We're going to need some clean water to bathe the wound. Ah. 
(The Doctor picks up a bucket and gives it to Kirsty.) 
KIRSTY: I'll not leave him. 
DOCTOR: We're not going to harm him. Polly? 
POLLY: Yes. 
DOCTOR: You go with her. 
POLLY: All right. 
DOCTOR: Off you go then. 
POLLY: Will you show me where the stream is? 
ALEXANDER: Here, Kirsty. Take the Laird's spyglass with you and watch out for these Sassenach dragoons. 
(Polly and Kirsty leave.) 
DOCTOR: You can put that away now, Ben. 
BEN: Put it away? But 
DOCTOR: Will you both give us your word that you'll not molest us? We're only trying to save your Laird from bleeding to death. 
ALEXANDER: Aye. 
JAMIE: You have our word. 
DOCTOR: Put it away, Ben. 
BEN: What, are you going to trust these blokes? 
DOCTOR: A Highlanders word is his bond. At least don't point it at me! 
(Ben tosses the pistol onto the table. Bang!) 
BEN: It just went off. 
ALEXANDER: You fool! 
JAMIE: You'll have every English soldier within miles! 
BEN: Well, what's wrong with that? 
DOCTOR: What's? You should have paid more attention to your history books, Ben. 
BEN: Ay? 
JAMIE: Redcoats! There's about six of them. 
ALEXANDER: They'll slaughter us.

[Culloden moor]

(An elegant officer, Algernon Ffinch, gazes down at the cottage.) 
SERGEANT: Sir! A rebel's been sighted, sir, at the door the cottage where the shooting seemed to come from. 
FFINCH: Good. Only one? 
SERGEANT: Only one seen, sire. There could be more. 
FFINCH: There better be. We haven't seen many, have we? 
SERGEANT: No, well, the troopers were ahead of us, sir. 
FFINCH: And done a good job. Now, I wish they'd left us some pickings. 
SERGEANT: Ah, perhaps when they got away they took their possessions with them. 
FFINCH: Let's hope so. Take a man around the rear, Sergeant. We'll out-flank them. 
SERGEANT: Sir! 
FFINCH: Tell them to shoot first and take no risks. Remember these rebels will be desperate by now. 
SERGEANT: Yes, sir! 
FFINCH: Advance in battle order. 
(His soldiers fix bayonets and advance.)

[Cottage]

JAMIE: We'll be caught like rats in a trap. Can we not run for it? 
ALEXANDER: And leave the Laird to their mercy? There is but one chance. It is but a very slim one. I will try and draw them away from this cottage. 
DOCTOR: Wait! Wait! 
(Alexander runs out to face the Redcoats.)

[Culloden moor]

ALEXANDER: Creag an tuire! 
(He is shot repeatedly.)

[Cottage]

SERGEANT: Surrender in the King's name! 
BEN: Blimey, it's good to hear a London voice again. 
SERGEANT: Silence, you rebel dog. 
BEN: Rebel? What are you talking about? I'm no rebel! Me and the Doctor here, have just arrived. 
SERGEANT: Deserter, then. You'll hang just the same. 
DOCTOR: (German accent) I'm glad you've come, Sergeant. I was waiting for an escort. 
SERGEANT: Who the devil do 
DOCTOR: Civil tongue, Sergeant! You are in charge of these men? 
FFINCH: No, I am. 
DOCTOR: A gentleman at last. Doctor von Wer, at your service. 
SERGEANT: Doctor who? 
DOCTOR: (sotto) That's what I said. 
FFINCH: One of those confounded froggies that came over with the Pretender. 
BEN: We ain't French. Are we? 
DOCTOR: German, from Hanover. Where your good King George comes from. And I speak English a good deal better than he does. 
SERGEANT: Hear that, sir. Treason! Shall we hang them now? 
FFINCH: Wait a moment. Who is that? 
JAMIE: Colin McLaren, the Laird, and I'm his piper. 
SERGEANT: Ah, they're a poor lot, sir. We'll get no pickings here. Let's hang them and have done. 
BEN: Well, a right shower you are! What have we done? Nothing! And what have you got against these two? They lost a battle, right? Well, doesn't that make them prisoners of war? 
FFINCH: Rebels are not treated as prisoners of war. Right, Sergeant, prepare to hang them. 
SERGEANT: Sir. Take him out. 
DOCTOR: Didn't I tell you I was 
SERGEANT: And you. 
BEN: But we haven't done anything! 
SERGEANT: And you. 
JAMIE: But he can't walk! 
SERGEANT: Drag him!

[Duke of Cumberland's line]

(On a supply wagon, an English solicitor called Grey has been watching the battle through a telescope. His secretary, Perkins, is setting up luncheon.) 
GREY: Perkins. Perkins! 
PERKINS: Yes, sir. 
GREY: Not a very inspiring battle, would you say, Perkins? 
PERKINS: Don't really know, sir. I've never seen one before. 
GREY: This one was over in a brief hour. Never have I seen such brave fellows so poorly led. And now, Cumberland's troops are butchering the wounded. It's such a waste of manpower. A little wine, Perkins? 
PERKINS: Oh, yes, sir. Quite ready for it, I am, sir. This sharp northern air, sir, gives one quite an appetite. 
(Two soldiers appear with a Scottish prisoner. The wounded Highlander looks longingly at the food as he is dragged past.) 
GREY: Ah, all these fine sturdy Highlanders. Used to hard work and little food. Think what a price they'd fetch in Jamaica or Barbados, Perkins. 
PERKINS: A pretty penny, no doubt, sir. No doubt at all. 
GREY: Indeed, and I'll have them, Perkins. I did not give up a thriving legal practise, just for the honour of serving King George as his Commissioner of Prisons. 
PERKINS: I thought there was more behind it, sir. 
GREY: With Mister Trask and his ship at our service, we may expect to clear some measure of profit out of this rebellion, ay Perkins? 
PERKINS: Yes, sir. 
GREY: Depending, of course, on how many of the wretched rebels we can deliver from his Majesty's over zealous soldiers. 
(Grey tastes his wine and spits it out in disgust, throwing the rest into Perkins' face.) 
GREY: The wine was corked. If you wish to remain in my service, you'll have to be more careful, won't you, Perkins? 
PERKINS: Yes, sir. My apologies, sir. It won't happen again, sir. 
GREY: I think we best be about our business, otherwise there'll be nothing but corpses left on the battlefield. And corpses are of little use to us, ay Perkins? 
PERKINS: Yes, sir. Wagon, sir? 
GREY: No, I think not. I've had enough for one day. Come, Perkins, we'll walk. 
PERKINS: Yes, sir. 
(Grey strides off, leaving Perkins to cope with the hamper.) 
GREY: Perkins. 
PERKINS: Yes, sir? 
(Perkins takes a mouthful of wine.) 
GREY: Perkins!

[Culloden moor]

(Polly and Kirsty are returning to the cottage with the water. At the top of the hill they spot the soldiers outside the cottage.) 
KIRSTY: Down! 
POLLY: Oh, you've spilt the water. Who are those men? 
KIRSTY: Don't pretend you can't recognise English Redcoats when you see them, even at this distance. 
POLLY: English? Well, that's all right, then. We're safe. 
KIRSTY: Do you want to get us both killed? Tortured? Look, they're going to hang our men. 
(Polly takes the telescope to see nooses being hung over the branch of an oak tree.) 
POLLY: You're right. It's horrible. They've got to be stopped. 
KIRSTY: How? 
POLLY: Well, there must be something we can do? 
KIRSTY: We can but mourn. 
POLLY: Crying's no good. Have you still got breath to run. Come on. We're going to create a diversion. 
(Polly throws a stone in the direction of the cottage.)

[Outside the cottage]

FFINCH: What was that? 
(A second stone hits a soldier.) 
SERGEANT: Look, sir, over there, on that hill. 
FFINCH: Looks like a wench. Stab me, there's another one. 
SERGEANT: Yeah, puts me in mind of what Sergeant King of the Dragoons said, sir. 
FFINCH: What? 
SERGEANT: Well, the Dragoons have got orders to stop every woman. Not that they need them, mind. 
FFINCH: Get to the point, Sergeant. 
SERGEANT: Well, they've heard that the Prince is trying to escape disguised as a woman. Shall I go after them, sir? 
FFINCH: No, I'll go. You two men, come with me. 
SERGEANT: Yeah, but I

[Culloden moor]

POLLY: This is our chance. The officer's coming after us. They can't hang them with the officer away. Let's go. 
KIRSTY: It'll do no good. 
POLLY: Besides which, you must know this place better than they do. 
KIRSTY: There's a high track. 
POLLY: And we're younger than they are. They'll never catch us. Come on. 
KIRSTY: But, look 
POLLY: Leave that. 
(Kirsty leaves the bucket. After a short while Polly has to abandon her shoes and go barefoot to keep up with Kirsty. The soldiers start to fall behind.)

[Outside the Cottage]

(The Doctor, Ben, Jamie and Colin all have nooses around their necks.) 
DOCTOR: What a great devotion to duty your Lieutenant shows, Sergeant. 
SERGEANT: Devotion to duty. Devotion to thirty thousand pound reward, that's all. 
DOCTOR: You think he will catch them? 
SERGEANT: That young whelp? Couldn't catch his own grandmother. 
DOCTOR: Disrespect to your superior officer, Sergeant? I could report you. 
SERGEANT: You could, but you won't. 
DOCTOR: Ah, but at a price, Sergeant. 
SERGEANT: You won't, cause you won't be here when he gets back. All right you scum, proceed with the hanging. 
BEN: Well, you can't hang us with the officer away. 
SERGEANT: Why do you think he went away? Got a delicate stomach, he has. Always leaves the dirty stuff to me. Right! Get them up! 
(The prisoners are forced to stand on a bench.) 
SERGEANT: Take the strain! Stand by! 
(A drum roll starts.) 
GREY: Halt! 
SERGEANT: What do you want? 
GREY: One moment! 
SERGEANT: Who the devil are you? 
GREY: Perkins. 
PERKINS: Solicitor Grey, Lincolns Inn Fields. His Majesty's Commissioner for the disposal of rebel prisoners. 
GREY: There's a fine sturdy young man. Take the nooses off them. Set that young man down. 
PERKINS: Set him down. 
SERGEANT: I don't care who you are. You've got no charge over my men. 
GREY: Can you not read, Sergeant? I have charge over all rebel prisoners. 
PERKINS: Of course he has. Appointed by the Chief Justice of England. All prisoners. 
SERGEANT: Not these. 
GREY: Perkins. 
(Perkins searches in his pocket.) 
GREY: The other pocket, I think. 
(Perkins produces some silver coins.) 
GREY: I admit your prior claim, Sergeant, but I think you are a reasonable man. 
(The payment is refused.) 
GREY: Continue, Perkins. Continue, I said. Of course, I regret any inconvenience encountered by yourself and these fine fellows of yours. 
SERGEANT: All right, you heard what the Commissioner said. Nooses off. Get him down. 
BEN: Oh, thanks, sir. 
GREY: A trifle, I assure you. Strong ruffians like you and this other young rebel here, are needed in his Majesty's service. 
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. 
(Grey gestures to the Doctor and Colin.) 
GREY: You can despatch this one, Sergeant, and this strange looking scoundrel. 
DOCTOR: Article Seventeen, Aliens Act, 1730. 
GREY: What? 
DOCTOR: You are gentlemen of the law? 
PERKINS: How dare you speak to Mister Grey like that. 
GREY: I am a lawyer, yes. 
DOCTOR: Then you are doubtless familiar with Article Seventeen. You cannot hang a citizen of a foreign power, without first informing his ambassador. 
PERKINS: Article Seventeen, Aliens Act? 
GREY: Who is this extraordinary rogue? 
SERGEANT: He says he's a frog doctor, sir. 
DOCTOR: German. And I know more about the English law than you do, it seems. 
SERGEANT: I'm the only law what matters to you right now, matey. And if this gentleman don't want you, you hang. 
GREY: No, wait. You show a touching faith in his Majesty's justice, sir. A doctor, eh? We need doctors where you're going. Send him along with the other prisoners to Inverness. 
JAMIE: The Laird goes too or you can hang me with him. I'll not go with ye. 
COLIN: No, go, Jamie, go. 
SERGEANT: We'll see about that. 
GREY: Sergeant! What do you think, Doctor? Can this man be healed of his wound? 
DOCTOR: With proper care, yes. 
GREY: Whether he'll get that where he is going is very doubtful. But I'll leave him in your care. Take him away, Sergeant. 
SERGEANT: Sir! 'Shun! You men escort these gentlemen and these prisoners to Inverness. I'll wait here for the Lieutenant. Come on, out. Get him down. 
DOCTOR: What will happen to us? 
GREY: First you go to Inverness, and then perhaps a sea voyage? 
SERGEANT: Do you good, rogue. Come on. 
GREY: Just in time, Perkins. Just in time.

[Cave]

KIRSTY: This is the cave. They'll not find us here. 
(A narrow fissure widens out into a large cave.) 
POLLY: You don't live here, do you? 
KIRSTY: Oh, no. The family use it as a hide out after a cattle raid. 
POLLY: A cattle raid? You mean you rob people? 
KIRSTY: No! We only take from those who steal from us. 
POLLY: Oh, it's dark. 
KIRSTY: Ah, there we are. 
POLLY: That's a funny kind of match. 
KIRSTY: What? 
POLLY: Match. Oh, it doesn't matter. 
KIRSTY: Now, we keep a supply of food here. Oh no, there's only one wheat biscuit. 
POLLY: When was it left here? 
KIRSTY: Well, about three months ago. 
POLLY: Oh, it's a dog biscuit. 
KIRSTY: Biscuits are not baked for dogs. But please do begin. 
POLLY: Oh, no, no, you start. I don't want to lose all my fillings. Teeth. Doesn't matter. You start. I'm not hungry, really. Got to make a plan. We saw them being marched away. Now where would they be taking them? 
KIRSTY: Inverness gaol. 
POLLY: Oh, look, don't start crying again. If they've taken them to gaol, then we've got to get them out. Have you got any money? 
KIRSTY: But what would we need money for? 
POLLY: Well, for food, of course. That biscuit isn't going to last very long. And for bribing guards with. What have we got we can sell? 
(Polly looks at her bracelet.) 
POLLY: This won't fetch much, but at least its a start. 
KIRSTY: Why should you help us? You're English. 
POLLY: They've got my friends too, remember? Yes, and I must get some proper clothes. 
KIRSTY: Aye, why do you wear the short skirts of a bairn? You're a grown woman. 
POLLY: Well, it would take too long to explain. 
(Polly notices a large ring on Kirsty's finger.) 
POLLY: Hey, that ring. It's gold. Look, you've got to trust me. 
KIRSTY: It doesn't belong to me. It's my father's. 
POLLY: Well, let me just look at it. Come on, now. I just want to look at it, that's all. It's beautiful. We should get a lot for that. 
KIRSTY: We're not going to sell it! 
POLLY: Not even to save your father's life? 
KIRSTY: He wouldn't thank me. 
POLLY: Oh, you're hopeless. Why not, for goodness sake? 
KIRSTY: He entrusted it to me before the battle. He would kill me if I ever parted with it. 
POLLY: I don't understand you people. Come on, give it to me. 
KIRSTY: No. 
POLLY: Look, give it to me! It's the. Please yourself! You're just a stupid peasant. I'm off to help my friends. You can stay here and guard your precious ring. 
KIRSTY: Look, mind your step. It'll be dark soon. 
POLLY [OC]: Watch out for yourself. 
KIRSTY: You'll get lost.

[Culloden moor]

(Polly walks along a rough track. An owl hoots. Suddenly the ground gives way under her feet and she falls. Polly screams. Winded but unhurt, Polly realises she has fallen into an animal trap. She tries to scramble out, as a hand clutching a dagger appears over her head. She screams again.)

Episode Two

[Animal trap]

POLLY: Don't. 
KIRSTY: Oh, it's yourself. 
POLLY: You! Of course it's myself. Who did you think it was? 
KIRSTY: I thought a Redcoat had fallen into the animal trap. 
POLLY: Well, by the look on your face I'm glad it wasn't. Come on, help me out of here. 
KIRSTY: Well, look, give me your hand then. 
POLLY: Wait a minute, I can't 
KIRSTY: Well, come on. 
POLLY: Pull! 
KIRSTY: I'm pulling! 
(Kirsty falls into the pit as well.) 
POLLY: Are you hurt? 
KIRSTY: Oh, no. Just a wee bruise or two and a lot of dirt. Now we're both trapped. 
POLLY: No we're not! Even your dour Scots lassies must have played piggy-back. 
KIRSTY: What? I don't understand. 
POLLY: Well, you bend down and I climb on top of you and scramble up. Look, I'll show you. 
KIRSTY: What? 
POLLY: Bend down here a minute. All right. 
KIRSTY: Oh! 
POLLY: You okay? 
KIRSTY: Quick, will ye! You're no light weight. Oh, go on. Hurry! Come on. 
POLLY: Shh! There's a light. Soldiers. 
KIRSTY: Redcoats. Oh, we're cornered. 
POLLY: No, we're not. They'll soon pass. 
(They both crouch down as Ffinch and his men approach.)

[Culloden moor]

FFINCH: (to the other soldiers) Halt! You dolt. Couldn't catch a couple of wenches, could you? Call yourselves soldiers? The terror of the Highlands? You wouldn't frighten an one-armed dairy maid. Well, I've done enough walking for one day. Go and fetch my horse. If you're not back within one hour, three hundred lashes apiece. Imbeciles! Give the lantern to me. I don't want to be left here in the dark. Right then, march! 
(The soldiers leave.)

[Animal trap]

KIRSTY: He's staying there. 
POLLY: Oh, not again. Didn't the women of your age do anything but cry? 
KIRSTY: What? 
POLLY: It doesn't matter. Listen, I've got an idea. Since our officer has so obligingly parked himself outside our pit, we'll lure him in to join us. 
KIRSTY: Oh, glory. 
POLLY: We'll be able to deal with him. Now, this is what we are going to do.

[Culloden moor]

(Ffinch has started eating when an owl hoots.) 
FFINCH: What's that? 
(He raises the lantern. Another woo sound and he draws his sword, moving towards the trap. More noises and then he falls in.)

[Animal trap]

KIRSTY: Move and I'll blow your brains out. 
POLLY: She will too, so you better keep still. I'm going to take the sash for his feet and you take the belt for his wrists. 
FFINCH: Outrageous! Do you know that for assaulting a King's Officer you could 
POLLY: I know. But you're not in charge now. The next thing is his pockets. 
KIRSTY: Ach, no! 
POLLY: Look, he's probably got money and we need it. 
FFINCH: You can't mean to rob me. 
KIRSTY: Look, you and your kind have robbed our glens. Look, he's got food. Chicken and bread. 
POLLY: Great! Now, my gallant officer. 
FFINCH: I've done you no harm. 
KIRSTY: 'Tis no thanks to you that my father and Jamie weren't hanged. They're probably rotting in gaol in Inverness by now.

[Gaol]

(Sounds of coughing in the dungeon that serves as Inverness gaol.) 
BEN: Look after him, mate. He'll be all right. Okay, mate, okay. Take it easy, take it easy. Sit down. 
(Their cell is circular, waterlogged and moss-lined.) 
BEN: A right rat hole this is, isn't it? 
JAMIE: Oh, King George has worse than this, never fear. 
BEN: Yeah, well, I'm glad Polly's out of it. Why did we ever get mixed up in this, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: I'm glad we did. I'm just beginning to enjoy myself. Down with King George! 
(Cheers.) 
SENTRY: Silence, you Jacobite pigs. You don't want to feel this bayonet. 
JAMIE: Oh, enjoy yourselves. So you are for the Prince after all? 
DOCTOR: No, not really. I just like hearing the echo, that's all. Let's have a look at his wound, shall we? 
JAMIE: Would you not be letting him now? 
DOCTOR: With care that'll heal. 
JAMIE: Ach, here's you saying you're a doctor, you've not even bled him yet. 
BEN: What's he on about? 
DOCTOR: Blood letting. 
BEN: Yeah, but that's stupid. 
JAMIE: It's the only way of curing the sick. 
BEN: Killing him, more like. He's lost enough blood already. 
DOCTOR: Oh, Isis and Osiris, is it meet? Aquarius, Aries, Taurus. 
JAMIE: Oh, aye. 
BEN: (Now what are you mumbling about? 
JAMIE: Whist, man. 
DOCTOR: Gemini and Taurus. When was the Laird born? 
JAMIE: In the fifth month. 
DOCTOR: That's what I thought. Now, blood letting must wait until Taurus is in the ascendant. So it is willed. 
BEN: You don't believe all that codswallop, do you? 
DOCTOR: Of course I do. So does he. He's never heard of germs. 
JAMIE: What was that word? 
DOCTOR: It's a secret word. 
BEN: Yeah, germs, they're all around us. 
DOCTOR: Used by German doctors. 
JAMIE: Oh, Ger-man. Germs. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Have you got a handkerchief, Ben? 
BEN: Yeah, here you are. 
DOCTOR: Good. 
JAMIE: Ach, that wee lassies kerchief? Here, Doctor, use mine. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. Just a fresh dressing. 
(As the Doctor binds Colin's wound he notices an embroidered silk cloth under his plaid.) 
DOCTOR: Hello, what's this? 
JAMIE: Prince Charlie's personal standard. 
BEN: What's he doing with it? 
JAMIE: Protecting it. Now put it back, will ye. If a sentry saw it 
DOCTOR: No, wait. 
The Doctor wraps it around his body under his coat.) 
JAMIE: What are you doing? 
DOCTOR: What chance do you think he has of evading the gallows with this on him? 
JAMIE: Well 
DOCTOR: Besides, it's really rather nice and warm. Let's have a tune to cheer us all up. 
(The Doctor produces his recorder.) 
BEN: Yeah, I didn't think we'd heard the last of that. 
SENTRY: Silence! 
JAMIE: Whist, man! 
DOCTOR: Well, you're a loyal Jacobite, aren't you? This is your tune. Come on, everybody, join in. 
SENTRY: Silence, I say! I warned you rebels once! Now we'll see what a touch of the bayonet will do. Now then!
BEN: The guard is coming down now. 
SENTRY: You! 
DOCTOR: (German) Thank heavens. Did you hear that tune? 
SENTRY: Heard a rebel dirge. 
DOCTOR: They were singing it to drive me out of my mind, as I'm a loyal subject to King George the Second! 
SENTRY: Now what's that got to do with me? 
DOCTOR: They know of a plot to murder your general, the Duke of Cumberland. 
JAMIE: What? 
BEN: Oh, come off it, Doctor. 
JAMIE: I knew he wasne one of us. 
DOCTOR: Take me to Solicitor Grey. Perhaps we're in time to prevent it. 
SENTRY: Why didn't you speak about this before? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's only just discovered. That rogue is party to it! 
(The prisoners shout and the guards take the Doctor away.) 
BEN: Well done, mate. 
JAMIE: What do you mean? Why don't you go and join your friend? 
BEN: Oh, calm down. Can't you see it was all a fiddle? 
JAMIE: Fiddle? 
BEN: Well, a trick, a ruse to get out of here. 
JAMIE: I don't understand you. 
BEN: Oh, blimey, look. Outside he's got a chance to get away and rescue us. What chance do you think he's got paddling round in here? 
JAMIE: Aye, nevertheless, I'm still worried. 
BEN: Now don't you worry about him, mate, worry about us. See that line? Well, that's where the water level comes up to. And tonight is not my bath night.

[Animal trap]

POLLY: seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty. Twenty guineas. How far do you think it will get us? 
KIRSTY: I've never seen so much money in all my days. 
FFINCH: You'll both hang for this, you know. 
POLLY: You're very fond of hanging, aren't you, Mister. Hey, what's your name? 
FFINCH: I refuse to tell you. 
POLLY: Oh, we're very brave all of a sudden. Watch him, Kirsty. He must have some form of. Ah-ha, yes. Algernon Thomas Alfred Ffinch. Two 'f's! Lieutenant in the Honourable Colonel Atwood's Rifles. So, I bet the Colonel would be highly interested to hear how his Lieutenant F-finch was captured by two girls. 
FFINCH: You would not tell. 
POLLY: Oh, wouldn't we? Give me the knife, Kirsty. 
FFINCH: What are you going to do? 
POLLY: Never fear, Algernon Thomas F-finch. We're just after a small souvenir, that's all. There we are. This piece of hair and this disc will be proof enough in case the Colonel doesn't believe us. 
KIRSTY: But, but why? 
POLLY: We need an ally in the enemy camp and I think we've found one. Right, Algernon? 
FFINCH: It's sheer blackmail. 
POLLY: Right again. Come on, Kirsty, let's go before this officer's soldiers get back. Bye bye, Algy dear. We'll be seeing you in Inverness. Come on, Kirsty. Up you go. All right? 
KIRSTY: Oh no. I

[Inverness - Sea Eagle inn]

(The lawyers meet with a sea captain in private.) 
TRASK: Well, lawyer, my old cattle boat's ready for its livestock. Belay there! What in thunder are you laughing at? 
GREY: It will be no laughing matter for any of us if we are caught, I can assure you. That is why we must begin loading the prisoners tonight. 
TRASK: Tonight? 
GREY: Before the judges are ready to try the rebels, we'll have them all safely on plantations. 
TRASK: Arr. A Highlander will do twice the work of one of your black slaves. 
PERKINS: At least twice. 
TRASK: Who asked for your opinion? 
GREY: Silence, Captain. I will not have my clerk bullied. I have enough evidence on you to send you to the gallows ten times over, and don't you forget it. 
(A knock on the door.) 
GREY: Come in! Well? 
SENTRY: One of the prisoners, sir. He insists on seeing you. Says he has some important information about a plot against the Duke's life, sir. 
GREY: Why come to me? 
SENTRY: Says he won't speak to no one else but you, sir. 
GREY: Which prisoner is it? 
SENTRY: The German doctor, sir. 
GREY: Ah, interesting. Bring him in at once. 
SENTRY: Sir. 
GREY: Well man, what are you waiting? Perkins. 
(Perkins reluctantly hands a shilling to the sentry, who then leaves.) 
GREY: Now, gentlemen, I suggest you start loading the prisoners at once. Here is your warrant. And to avoid comment, you'd better take them the back way. 
SENTRY: The prisoner, sir. 
GREY: Perkins. Trask. 
(Trask and Perkins leave past the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: Auf Wiedersehen. 
TRASK: Arr. 
(Grey takes a flintlock pistol from the case on his desk and puts it on the table.) 
GREY: You may go. 
SENTRY: Sir. 
(The sentry leaves.) 
GREY: Now, Doctor, your story. I hope it is an entertaining one. It has cost me a silver shilling. Very well then, what is the nature of this plot? 
DOCTOR: There is no plot. 
GREY: Have a care, Doctor. You waste my time at your peril. 
DOCTOR: Would the chance to lay your hands on 15,000 pounds be a waste of your time? 
GREY: What would a vagabond like you know of such a sum, pray? 
DOCTOR: The personal standard of Prince Charles Edward. 
GREY: Indeed. 
DOCTOR: Whoever was entrusted with this standard stood closest to the councils of the Prince, you would agree? He would also know where the Prince was most likely to run to. 
GREY: Which prisoner carried this standard? 
DOCTOR: That must remain my secret for the time being. 
GREY: There are ways to force your tongue. 
DOCTOR: But why employ them, since we are both on the same side? The 30,000 pounds reward for the capture of the Prince is surely enough to satisfy both of us. 
GREY: Ah, you have some fresh information as to his whereabouts? 
DOCTOR: I am on the track of some, but I need a free hand. 
(Throwing the flag over Grey's head, the Doctor snatches the pistol.) 
DOCTOR: Don't cry out. I'm not very expert with these things and it just might go off in your face. Turn around and put your hands behind you. 
GREY: You'll pay for this. 
DOCTOR: Just keep very still. 
(The Doctor uses Grey's own belt to tie his hands.) 
DOCTOR: There, now turn around. Why, great heavens, man, your throat. 
GREY: What? 
DOCTOR: It's so swollen. Does it hurt you? 
GREY: No, of course not. 
DOCTOR: Say ahh. 
GREY: What? 
DOCTOR: Ahh. 
GREY: Ahh. Mphf! 
(The Doctor stuffs a handkerchief into Grey's mouth.) 
DOCTOR: I've never seen a silent lawyer before. 
(A knock at the door.) 
DOCTOR: Would you mind just waiting in here? Another patient, you understand. 
(The Doctor shoves Grey into a cupboard then sits at the solicitor's desk.) 
DOCTOR: Enter. 
PERKINS: Oh, er, pardon, I thought that 
DOCTOR: You thought what? 
PERKINS: The, the Solicitor? 
DOCTOR: Your master's a very sick man. He's gone to lie down. It lucky for him I was called in time. Well, great heavens, man. Your eyes! 
PERKINS: What? 
DOCTOR: Your eyes. Come over here to the light. 
(Perkins sits in the chair and the Doctor leans over him, bringing out a magnifying glass to examine his eyes.) 
Your eyes, man. You suffer from headaches? 
PERKINS: No, I don't. 
(The Doctor bangs Perkins' head on the desk.) 
DOCTOR: No headaches? 
PERKINS: Well, er. Ow! 
(Another thump.) 
DOCTOR: Oh dear. You call me a liar? 
PERKINS: Well, no, no, no, no. Me head does ache. 
DOCTOR: Of course it does, what did you expect? Your eyes. 
PERKINS: Me eyes? What did you find? 
DOCTOR: Print blindness. You read too much. 
PERKINS: Well, 'tis true, I'm a clerk. What must I do? 
DOCTOR: You must rest them for at least an hour. 
PERKINS: But, I 
DOCTOR: That is my prescription. Ignore it at your peril. Now, lie down on the table. That's right. And put this over your eyes and rest them for at least an hour. 
(A thumping sound comes from the cupboard.) 
PERKINS: What's that knocking? 
DOCTOR: Knocking? It's not knocking, it's in your mind. In your eyes. Now rest your eyes and the knocking will grow fainter, and fainter, and fainter. One hour, remember. 
PERKINS: One hour, Doctor. One hour. 
(The Doctor blows him a kiss and leaves.)

[Animal trap]

SERGEANT [OC]: Sir? 
FFINCH: Sergeant! 
SERGEANT [OC]: Where are you sir? I can't quite see you. 
FFINCH: I'm down here, man! 
SERGEANT: Oh, there you are, sir. 
FFINCH: What took you so long, you jackanapes? 
SERGEANT: Well, we made the best time we could in the dark, sir, but it's hard to see our way, you see? 
FFINCH: Well, don't just stand there. Get me out of this infernal hole. 
SERGEANT: All right, you two, I'll handle this. You go and stand guard by the Lieutenant's horse. Come on. 
FFINCH: Well, come on, man. Help me out! 
SERGEANT: Well, it's er, it's very deep, sir. 
FFINCH: Get me out at once or I'll order you five hundred lashes apiece! 
SERGEANT: Oh, don't misunderstand me, sir. I'm willing enough to try, but you see, er, we're not used to pulling officers out of pits. 
FFINCH: Confound it, man, what are you jabbering about? 
SERGEANT: Well, I mean to say, sir, you see, er, officers don't usually fall into pits. 
FFINCH: You'll regret this, Sergeant. 
SERGEANT: Ah, it isn't me, sir. You see, it's the men I'm thinking about. I mean, they're not used to it, like. I mean, they're going to be very slow, sir. And they're going to be very dry. 
FFINCH: I see! Well, here's some money to drink with and I hope it chokes you! 
(Then he remembers the girls have taken all his money.) 
FFINCH: You'll, er, get it when we return to Inverness. Well, for the last time, man, get me out of here.

[Inverness - Sea Eagle inn]

TRASK: We've started shipping them across. What in thunder? 
PERKINS: I'm resting me eyes. 
TRASK: Damn your eyes. Where's your master? 
PERKINS: The Doctor says he must rest too. 
TRASK: Rest? 
(Trask opens the cupboard to reveal Grey.) 
TRASK: Now what have we here then? A pretty sight you look, lawyer. And what might this be a cure for, Saint Vitus's Dance? 
GREY: Oh, release me you fool. You let him escape. 
PERKINS: Well, I didn't know. It's me head. 
GREY: One more such folly, t'will need no further cures. 
TRASK: The Prince's standard. 
GREY: Aye, he used that to trick me with, but he won't get far. Perkins, summon the watch! And you, get those prisoners aboard before the soldiers get here. 
TRASK: Arr.

[Inn scullery]

(Perkins runs past the scullery where a maid is washing dishes and humming to herself.) 
MAN [OC]: Mollie, where are ye? 
MOLLIE: All richt, all richt. 
MAN [OC]: Mollie! 
MOLLIE: Whist your noise, I'm coming. 
(Throwing off her apron, Mollie leaves. The Doctor comes out of hiding. A washing line stretches along one wall hung with gowns, petticoats and aprons. There is a large rough table with platters of bread and meat and a flagon of wine. The Doctor starts towards the food, then changes his mind. He hears footsteps outside.) 
MAN [OC]: There must be some grub around here somewhere. 
(The Doctor hides behind the clothesline as two Redcoats enter and sit at the table.)

[Gaol]

TRASK: That's two of them, and room for one more. Here! 
SENTRY: All right you, come on. He's done for. 
TRASK: The next one, you swab. 
SENTRY: You. You'll do. Out with the others. Come on, all three of you. Outside! Move! 
(The other prisoners shout as Jamie, Colin and Ben are dragged from the cell and out of the gaol.)

[Inverness - Sea Eagle inn corridor]

SENTRY: Now, look lively! 
(The prisoners are pushed along a corridor, past an old woman struggling with a large pot. Ben nearly knocks her over.) 
BEN: Sorry. 
TRASK: Watch your feet, you swab. Out of the way, you. Right, open up. 
(A sentry unlocks a door and Trask motions the prisoners into a bare wooden room.) 
SENTRY: Come on through. Get a move on, now. Step lively.

[Inverness - Sea Eagle room]

JAMIE: Where's your friend? 
BEN: Polly? I don't know. Safe, I hope. 
JAMIE: And Kirsty, too. They're well out of it. But I mean the Doctor. 
BEN: I dunno. He'll be here though, don't worry. 
JAMIE: Yeah, in a wee moment it'll just be too late. 
TRASK: Silence, you two! Unless ye wants a taste of this! Right, you're all going down there. Right, Pat lad, down he goes. 
(Wooden steps lead down through a trap door to a small landing stage where a rowing boat is moored. Jamie and Ben help Colin clamber down.)

[Rowing boat]

(A small group of prisoners are huddled at the stern of the boat, with two of Trask's men at the oars.) 
SENTRY: Right, Mister Trask, that's the lot. 
BEN: Well, where are you taking us? 
TRASK: You'll find out soon enough. 
JAMIE: You've not a mind to drown us, have you? 
TRASK: Ha! Wouldn't pollute the firth with ye. Get in the boat. 
BEN: Quick, we can make a break for it and swim. 
JAMIE: I can't swim. 
BEN: Now you tell me. 
TRASK: In the boat! 
(Ben gets into the boat with Jamie and Colin. The prisoners are manacled,) 
TRASK: Right. Off.

[Inverness - Sea Eagle room]

(The trap door is closed by the soldiers. The old woman is the Doctor in disguise and 'she' appears in the doorway.) 
SENTRY: All right, Fred. Come on, let's move. 
DOCTOR: But, officer 
SENTRY: Go away, will you. 
DOCTOR: I've bought a wee drop of broth for Mister Trask. 
SENTRY: Well, he's not here, miss. He's gone. He's not here. 
DOCTOR: Will you have it officer? It's a pity to waste a nice hot broth. Do you good. 
SENTRY: Oh, all right, I'll have it. It's a cold night outside anyway. What are you looking at? There's not enough here for two. Go on, get back to your post! Go! Move! 
(He sends out the soldiers and the old woman, then goes in the opposite direction. The Doctor reappears, delighted that the door has not been locked. He goes back in and opens the trap door.)

[Ship Annabelle]

(On the deck is a man tied hand and foot, supported by two sailors.) 
TRASK: Belay there, you swabs! In case you're thinking of escaping, there's Jim Hughes for you. He didn't find it an happy ship, so I'll find him another berth where he'll be happy! 
(The bound man is thrown over board, sinking instantly.) 
TRASK: Once aboard the Annabelle, that's the only way you'll get off her. Straight downwards! Arr.

Episode Three

[Annabelle's hold]

(The hold is packed full of captured Highlanders huddled together in the half-light. Ben, Jamie and Colin are forced down the ladder.) 
TRASK: Get in there! 
BEN: But there's no room. 
TRASK: Room enough for rebels. Get stored below. 
BEN: What have you got down here, stinking fish? 
TRASK: That's exactly what it is, stinking fish. 
JAMIE: Well, I'm not going. 
TRASK: Yes you are, you scurvy swab. Another word out of you and I'll be down here with my cutlass. You'll learn who's master here. 
(There's lots of coughing from the residents.) 
BEN: Oh, you can hardly breathe. 
COLIN: At least we're alive. 
JAMIE: Are you feeling better, sir? 
COLIN: Greatly recovered, thank you, Jamie. My fever's going. 
JAMIE: Aye, it'll be no better for being cooped up in this hell hole. 
BEN: Yeah, for how long though? And where are they sending us? 
COLIN: Who kens. 
BEN: What? 
JAMIE: Who knows? 
BEN: Well, someone here might. Hey mate, got any idea where they're sending us? 
WILLY: Beware. They're spies. 
BEN: What? 
WILLY: This man's an Englishman. One more blow we can strike for Scotland. 
BEN: Ay? What are you talking about? 
WILLY: One more piece of vermin to be stamped out. 
BEN: What are you going to do? 
WILLY: Put the foot into him and tramp his English bones into the deck. Back! Back! I discovered him. The first blow will be mine. 
COLIN: Will MacKay would never strike a friend of the Prince. 
WILLY: I know that voice. 
COLIN: Ye havna been away so long you don't recognise me. 
WILLY: Ach, man, it's yourself. Colin McLaren. 
COLIN: And Jamie, son of Donald McCrimmon. A piper, like his father and his father's father. 
JAMIE: With no pipes though, just my chanter. 
WILLY: Ah, wee Jimmy. But this Englishman, he is a friend to our Prince? 
COLIN: He is a friend of mine. He helped bring me here, weak but alive. 
WILLY: Ach well now, I crave your pardon. A friend of the McLaren's is a friend of mine. 
BEN: Well thanks, I'm glad to hear it. 
WILLY: Then how came he here with you? 
JAMIE: Who, Ben? He's a deserting English sailor. So we take him back home. 
WILLY: A sailor. I'm a man of the sea myself. The master of this very vessel. 
BEN: If you're the skipper here, what's that Trask geezer doing on the bridge? 
WILLY: That shark was my mate. I was running arms from France past the blockade. Trask betrayed me. The Navy boarded the Annabelle and now he's sailing the ship for King George! 
BEN: Oh yeah? 
WILLY: You doubt my word? 
BEN: Oh no, skipper, just the bit about working for King George. 
WILLY: What do you mean? 
BEN: Well, we're not exactly being treated like prisoners of war, now are we? Doesn't it occur to you that this Trask could be using this vessel without the knowledge of his King and Sovereign in order to work some big fiddle on his own account? 
WILLY: Fiddle? 
BEN: Look, mate, he is going to sell us like the stinking fish he thinks we are. Slave labour, that's what we're going to be, slave labour!

[Barn]

(On the outskirts of Inverness, Polly is waiting for Kirsty. There is a noise outside, so she looks out to see an old tinker passing by, leading a donkey laden with pots and pans. Polly plays with the dirk Kirsty has left her, stabbing at the air, but ends up dropping it. Another noise makes Polly turn around.) 
POLLY: Kirsty! You gave me such a fright. 
KIRSTY: I'm not used to fetching and carrying, you know. We used to have our own servants. 
POLLY: That's obvious. Did you get everything? 
KIRSTY: Aye, the clothes for you and trays and oranges. But, what so we have to spend our money on oranges for? 
POLLY: You'll see. Hey, these are great. Last time we went back to the past I had to wear boy's clothes all the time. 
KIRSTY: What? 
POLLY: Now then. How do I look? 
KIRSTY: Bonnie enough. 
POLLY: Okay, the next thing is the oranges. In the trays. 
KIRSTY: You're not going to have us selling oranges, are ye? 
POLLY: What? I haven't got it wrong, have I? You do have orange sellers, don't you? I mean Nell Gwyn and all that? 
KIRSTY: Nell Gwyn? Well, of course there are orange sellers in Scotland. But they're mostly coarse common girls. 
POLLY: The sort that hang around soldiers. 
KIRSTY: Yes. 
POLLY: Right, then we're going to be orange sellers. 
KIRSTY: What? 
POLLY: Well look, how else can we find out where they've taken the Doctor and your father? 
KIRSTY: But if they catch us. 
POLLY: We still have a friend. 
KIRSTY: Who? 
POLLY: Algernon F-finch. Always assuming he's got out of that terrible pit.

[Inverness - Sea Eagle dining room]

(The room is full. A group of soldiers are playing cards. The Doctor is still disguised as an old woman. When Ffinch enters, all the soldiers stand to attention.) 
FFINCH: Sit down. Sit down. Wench! Get me some wine. Come on, hurry up, woman. At last. Be off with you. I'll pay later. That's better. That's better. 
(Sergeant Clegg arrives with two orange sellers.) 
SERGEANT: All right, you two, in here and see the officer. Go on, in you go. Get in there. 
KIRSTY: Put your hands off me or I'll scalp the hide off ye! 
POLLY: Kirsty, be quiet! 
KIRSTY: I'm not having a great ugly Englishman laying hands on me! Filthy. 
POLLY: Keep quiet, Kirsty, you'll give away the game. 
SERGEANT: Over here, both of you. 
KIRSTY: Will you stop that! Stop it! You'll pay for this. 
SERGEANT: All right you scum, get back! Get out or you'll be flayed alive. Go on. 
KIRSTY: Oh, you're so brave, Sergeant. 
SERGEANT: Very funny. Over there. 
POLLY: Algy. Algernon. 
FFINCH: What? 
POLLY: Algernon. Hey, wake up. Wake up, Algy. 
FFINCH: Oh no! 
SERGEANT: These two look like the rebels we were searching for yesterday, sir. 
POLLY: What a nasty man. Tell him we're not, Algy, dear. 
FFINCH: Oh, just a minute. 
KIRSTY: Aye, we're old friends. 
SERGEANT: I can see that. 
FFINCH: Well, that's all, Sergeant. Be about your business. 
SERGEANT: Sir. All right, you scum, out of it! The King doesn't pay you to lay around here all day. Go on, out, all of you. The last one out gets five hundred lashes. Now go on, beat it! Out! 
(Clegg follows the soldiers out into the street.) 
FFINCH: This is really too much. 
POLLY: Oh, Algy, we thought you'd be flattered. We turned to you for help immediately, didn't we Kirsty? 
KIRSTY: Just the sort of man two defenceless girls would turn to. 
FFINCH: I'll have you thrown in prison. 
POLLY: Alfred Algernon Thomas 
FFINCH: Quiet. What more do you want from me? Stab me, you've taken all my money. I haven't even the price of a glass of wine left on me. 
POLLY: I don't suppose the Doctor and the others have a glass of water to drink, never mind wine. Now, where are they? 
FFINCH: How should I know? In prison, I expect, where they belong. 
KIRSTY: They're not, we've checked. Now where are they? 
FFINCH: I don't know. I just round them up. You'll have to ask Solicitor Grey. He's in charge of prisoners, not me. 
POLLY: Where is he? 
FFINCH: He's got a room somewhere near here. Can I go? Dash it, I haven't had a wink of sleep yet. 
POLLY: Oh, you poor thing. Go on. But be careful. Not a word to anyone. 
(The Doctor tries to attract Polly's attention as Ffinch leaves, meeting Perkins coming in.) 
FFINCH: Two wenches there to see the Solicitor. 
(Perkins bumps into the Doctor.) 
PERKINS: Oh, I beg your pardon, madam. Kindly sit down here. Cedric Perkins, Solicitor's Clerk, ladies, at your service. What can I do for you? 
POLLY: Where is the Solicitor? 
PERKINS: Seeing to his duties. Giving some rebel prisoners the choice between life and death.

[Annabelle's hold]

TRASK: Silence there, you bilge rats! And quiet! Pipe down there. Quiet. The Solicitor hath news for ye. 
GREY: Rebels, your attention. A mark of clemency from his most gracious Majesty King George. 
TRASK: Get down! Get down! 
GREY: This clemency can be withdrawn, so hark ye. 
WILLY: We're harking to ye. 
GREY: It has pleased his Majesty to declare, that whereas there are a great many of his rebellious subjects in gaol, a speedy example must be made of them. 
COLIN: Ah, clemency. 
GREY: Therefore it is ordained that there will be those required as witnesses. 
JAMIE: Traitors, you mean. 
GREY: Witnesses. Those not wanting to turn King's evidence will be hanged. 
TRASK: Pipe down! Pipe down, you dogs! 
GREY: Wait! There is, there is another alternative. Thank you, Mister Trask. 
TRASK: Arr! 
GREY: Plantation workers are required to work in his Majesty's colonies in the West Indies. I have here seven year contracts. Sign your name to these and you will receive free transportation to your new homes. Well? Which of you lucky lads will be the first to sign? 
(One of the Highlanders goes to the table.) 
WILLY: Don't touch that pen! I know fine what you offer, Mister Solicitor. I have seen these plantations in the Indies. Not one of you men that signs will live out your seven years. Better a quick and honourable death at the end of a rope, than a long slow one after months of 
GREY: Who is this man? 
TRASK: Willy MacKay, former master of this vessel. I should have done for him long ago. 
GREY: Later, Trask, later. Listen to me, all of you. You've heard what MacKay here offers you. Death with honour? What, lingering on the end of a halter? Followed, may I remind you, by quartering and the like courtesies extended to rebels. I offer you life, with a chance to work for your eventual liberty. 
WILLY: Liberty? 
GREY: Unless of course, Mister MacKay, you would care to turn King's evidence. For the rest of you, for those who wish to sign, over here. For those who wish to hang, over there. Make your choice! 
(Only Jamie, Ben, Willy and Colin don't line up to sign.) 
TRASK: Right, line up over here. That's it, stand in a line ye. Now, pipe down. Get those signatures on the contract. Pipe down there! 
GREY: Well, well, MacKay. Only four for the gallows? 
BEN: Now hang on a minute 
JAMIE: No, Ben, you can't! 
COLIN: Oh, let him go, let him go. 
BEN: I'm not a Scots, but can I sign? 
GREY: Why not? 
BEN: Can I read it first? 
GREY: Of course. 
(Ben starts to read, then tears the contracts to pieces.) 
TRASK: You scurvy swab! 
(Trask lashes out with the handle of his whip, knocking Ben down.) 
GREY: Clap him in irons. When I return with new contracts, we'll bind him and drop him from the highest yard-arm. 
TRASK: Mister Solicitor, mark this! 
GREY: All of you! The next man who tries to oppose me will not be so fortunate. See to it. 
TRASK: Right, Parker, clap him in irons. 
(The unconscious Ben is dragged off.)

[Inverness - Sea Eagle inn]

(Perkins is entertaining the uneasy Kirsty and Polly.) 
POLLY: Mister Grey doesn't seem to be coming. I think we'd better be off. 
PERKINS: Oh surely, ladies, you won't deprive an old fellow of your charming company? I assure you he won't be long. 
POLLY: Nevertheless, I think 
PERKINS: I insist! 
POLLY: No! 
PERKINS: Very well, I shall rouse the watch. They may be interested in two such genteel orange wenches. That's better. Now, to pass the time, what say you to a nice round of whist. 
DOCTOR: (woman) You need four for whist. 
PERKINS: Kindly remove yourself, madam. 
DOCTOR: There's nothing nicer than a nice game of whist. 
PERKINS: Madam, I told you. 
DOCTOR: (normal) I'm sure you'll oblige an old woman. 
(The Doctor is pointing Grey's pistol at Perkins.) 
PERKINS: The German Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Perhaps you'd like to count the trumps? 
PERKINS: Well, I, er. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear, clubs. Would you like to deal, Polly orange wench. 
GREY: Perkins, I want. What the devil are you at, man? 
PERKINS: Well I, er. Well I, er. Just playing a round of cards, Mister Grey. GREY: Indeed. Then you can just come up to my room. I want more contracts. 
POLLY: Mister Grey? 
GREY: Yes? 
POLLY: Nothing. 
GREY: Come along, Perkins, make haste. 
PERKINS: I have to go. 
DOCTOR: Not just yet. Remember, you have seen nothing. 
PERKINS: What? 
DOCTOR: Your eyes. 
PERKINS: Eyes? 
DOCTOR: Yes. You wouldn't want another headache, now would you? 
PERKINS: Oh, no, no, no. But er. 
DOCTOR: I tell you what we're going to do. We ladies are going to leave first, but you are going to sit here, quietly, comfortably, for another ten minutes. 
PERKINS: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Before you leave, because I am going to watch you all the time. And if you move 
PERKINS: Yes, I understand, sir. 
DOCTOR: Now, girls, let's leave this rough place. Ten minutes, remember? 
PERKINS: Ten minutes, Doctor. Ten minutes.

[Barn]

POLLY: Come on, it's quite safe. All right? 
DOCTOR: Very good, very good. 
POLLY: That horrible little man's face. 
KIRSTY: Twas a picture right enough. 
POLLY: Hey, why did he call you the German doctor, Doctor? Doctor, be careful! 
KIRSTY: You'll have the town upon us! 
(The Doctor has fired the pistol.) 
DOCTOR: It's not loaded. They're dangerous things. 
POLLY: You know, those dresses really do suit you, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Oh, you saucy girl. 
KIRSTY: You're the very image of my old granny McLaren. 
POLLY: You're wonderful, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: I know. 
POLLY: You've even managed to cheer old Kirsty up. 
KIRSTY: Oh, aye. I'd forgotten. 
POLLY: Now what are we going to do? 
DOCTOR: Do? What do you mean, do? 
POLLY: Doctor, don't go all sleepy on us now. We've got to do something. 
DOCTOR: All right, go ahead. 
POLLY: If only we knew where the others were. 
DOCTOR: They're on the ship. 
POLLY: What? 
DOCTOR: They're on the ship, the Annabelle. Master's name, Trask. Not a nice man. You wouldn't like him. 
(The Doctor lies back in the hay and closes his eyes.) 
POLLY: Doctor! Doctor! Look, if they're on the ship, then we've got to get them off it. Or 
DOCTOR: Or what? 
POLLY: Or capture the ship. 
KIRSTY: What would we do that for? 
POLLY: Well, couldn't you sail to somewhere safe? I mean, wasn't France your ally, or something? 
KIRSTY: I won't leave Scotland. 
DOCTOR: It'd be safer. 
KIRSTY: Never. 
DOCTOR: Well it wouldn't be for very long. Just for seven, just for a few years, and then it'd be safe to come back. 
KIRSTY: But why should I leave my own country? 
DOCTOR: Oh, please yourself. But you and your father may get killed if you stay in the glens. 
KIRSTY: Are you sure there's no other way? 
POLLY: Look, the Doctor says it won't be for long. 
KIRSTY: What must we do? 
POLLY: We must make a plan. Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Hmm? 
POLLY: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Hmm! 
POLLY: Have you got a plan for us? 
DOCTOR: No. 
POLLY: Oh, go on, I know you better than that. You must have a plan. 
DOCTOR: Well, it's just a wee idea really. 
POLLY: Go on. 
DOCTOR: I've only just thought about it. It won't work, but it'd be a try. Anyone got any money? 
POLLY: Yes, seventeen guineas that we pinched from the English Lieutenant. 
DOCTOR: That's a fortune in these days. Now, we want weapons, lots of them, and a rowing boat. 
KIRSTY: I can get a rowing boat. 
DOCTOR: Good, and we can buy the weapons. 
POLLY: Can we? 
DOCTOR: From the English soldiers. Well, they're bound to have heaps of weapons as souvenirs. 
POLLY: Yes, but will they sell them to us? 
DOCTOR: You don't know the English soldier. He'd sell his grandmother for tuppence ha'penny. 
KIRSTY: And then? 
DOCTOR: We smuggle them aboard the Annabelle. 
POLLY: That's great. And then what? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know, we'll think of something. I must get some sleep. 
POLLY: Doctor! Doctor! Oh.

[Annabelle deck]

(Perkins and Grey have been rowed over. Grey goes aboard, followed by Perkins carrying the papers.) 
GREY: Mister Trask! Devil take him, where is the man? Mister Trask! Ah, you. Go and fetch Mister Trask. Mister Trask! 
TRASK: Aye? 
GREY: Is everything in readiness? 
TRASK: It is. 
GREY: I've had Perkins here copy out three contracts, just to make sure. And if anyone tries that trick again of tearing them up, shoot him down immediately. 
TRASK: Don't you worry about that. 
GREY: We need two of the contracts to be signed. 
TRASK: Every man jack of them will sign. If not with ink, then with blood. Tis all the one to me. 
GREY: No. You're not dealing with slaves, man. These Highlanders are men of high courage and resolution. Flog but one of them, they'll all stand together and refuse to sign a thing. You'll undo everything I've worked for. No, once they're safely sold in Barbados they can be whipped to death for all I care. Until then, use a light fist, or you'll answer to me. 
TRASK: And the London deserter, what about him? 
GREY: Proceed with the ducking. It'll serve as a useful encouragement to the rest. Perkins, go below. Make the preparations. 
PERKINS: Yes, sir. 
GREY: And, Perkins, bring the deserter on deck. 
PERKINS: Of course, sir.

[Barn]

(Polly and Kirsty have obtained a meagre supply of weapons and are waiting for the Doctor to come back.) 
POLLY: Haven't done very well, have we? 
KIRSTY: They wouldn't take me seriously. 
POLLY: No, nor me. I do hope the Doctor's had better luck. (knocking) Who's there? 
DOCTOR [OC}: Me. 
(The Doctor pushes in a small hand barrow covered with a tarpaulin.) 
POLLY: Let's see, Doctor. What have you got? 
DOCTOR: No. Let's see yours first. 
POLLY: Oh look, don't tease us. Look. 
DOCTOR: Oh. It's a start. 
(The Doctor reveals a large pile of swords, muskets, and pistols.) 
KIRSTY: You must have robbed the Duke's arsenal. 
DOCTOR: Yes, something like that. 
POLLY: You're fantastic. 
DOCTOR: I know. 
KIRSTY: Look, there's a bonnie one. 
DOCTOR: Just a minute. 
KIRSTY: What is it? 
DOCTOR: This ring. Now, let me see. 
POLLY: Oh, that. It's her father's. She won't let you touch it. 
DOCTOR: I'm not surprised. It's not her father's. 
KIRSTY: You're lying! 
POLLY: What! 
KIRSTY: It is! 
DOCTOR: Then why has it the Stuarts' seal? 
KIRSTY: My father bade me not tell where he got it. 
DOCTOR: Until the right time. That time has now arrived. 
KIRSTY: The Prince gave it to my father off his own hand in heat of battle. My father saved the Prince's life. 
DOCTOR: Then it is right and proper that it should now save his life. Give it me. Thank you. I wonder. Bait. 
KIRSTY: What? 
DOCTOR: Bait for a very greedy man.

[Annabelle deck]

(Ben is carried on deck with his arms and legs bound. Another rope is tied around his waist.) 
TRASK: Right, lads, take him up. 
(Ben is hoisted into the air and swung out over the side of the ship. At a signal from Trask he is dropped into the water. A stream of bubbles rises to the surface.)

Episode Four

[Annabelle deck]

(At last, Trask signals for Ben to be hauled up again. But there is no one on the end of the rope.) 
GREY: He's not escaped? 
(On the other side of the ship, Ben surfaces in the shadows. He catches his breath then swims for the shore. A fog descends and he loses track of the time.)

[Quayside]

(Finally he reaches the quay and just manages to pull himself onto the jetty. After a few gasps, he looks up to see the business end of a musket.) 
BEN: Oh, no. Not after all that. I give up. 
(The soldier peels off his moustache.) 
BEN: It's you, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Who else would be walking around the jetty at this time of night dressed like a soldier who'd been wounded in battle? 
BEN: Yeah, you've got a point there. But why? 
DOCTOR: Why? Because I like it here. Besides, it keeps the other soldiers away. 
BEN: Oh, I'm cold and hungry. 
DOCTOR: I know just the place. Hold that. I'll just get these things aboard the boat. 
BEN: The boat? 
DOCTOR: Just a few wee gifties for our friends aboard the Annabelle. Come on.

[Captain's cabin]

PERKINS: There you are, sir, all signed and attested. It but wants your signature. 
GREY: Not before time. 
TRASK: A little wine for your cold heart, lawyer? 
GREY: I never mix liquor with business. I would advise you to do the same. We sail on the morning tide, remember. 
TRASK: Happen it's too foggy to sail, what then? 
GREY: (sternly) You sail, fog or no fog. 
TRASK: And crash the old girl's timbers on Chanonry Point. 
GREY: I took you for a seaman. 
TRASK: Why, that I am. I am! Trask'll get your cargo of little booties to Barbados, never fear. That's what really counts, lawyer. Not those dried up bits of parchment of yours. 
GREY: Without these bits of parchment, we would all sail foul of the King's law. 
TRASK: Law? What does the law or anyone care for those Highland cattle we carry? 
GREY: Nothing. But to take these cattle safely to the slave plantations, before their strength is sapped by his Majesty's prisons, that takes skill and preparation. 
TRASK: And what would happen to you and me if this trade were to be discovered to the Duke? 
GREY: That will never happen, Trask. There are but three of us privy to this secret. I can answer for myself and Perkins. Ay, Perkins? 
PERKINS: Oh, yes sir. Yes sir, indeed you may. 
GREY: As for you, Captain, you must answer for yourself. 
TRASK: Twas but in jest. You know me, Solicitor. I'm your man. 
GREY: Aye, and that is the way you will remain, Mister Trask.

[Barn]

(Ben is finishing off a meal of stew and bread.) 
BEN: Ah, that's better. Never thought I'd live to see a meal like that again. 
POLLY: But listen Ben, how did you manage to get loose? Underwater, I mean? 
BEN: Well it's the old Houdini trick, duchess. You flex your muscles when they tie you up, then when you're ready, you relax them. Well that way you're half the size you were before. Get it? 
KIRSTY: No. 
POLLY: And that's all there is to it? 
BEN: Well, almost all. 
POLLY: I bet. 
POLLY: Hey you've got your own clothes back. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Can you imagine, I found them thrown out on the rubbish dump, behind the inn. 
BEN: Amazing, isn't it? Well mine should be dry by now. 
POLLY: I liked you better in your dress, Doctor. 
KIRSTY: Aye, you made a good granny. 
DOCTOR: Now then, do we all know what we have to do? Ben? 
BEN: Yeah, I take you out to the ship in the rowing boat. Then double round the back smartish while they're sorting you out, and then pass the weapons through the porthole. 
POLLY: While Kirsty and I just sit here and wait for you to get back, if you ever do. No fear. 
KIRSTY: We've done enough waiting. 
DOCTOR: But it may be dangerous. They may not swallow my story. 
BEN: Yeah, and they may see me in the boat, even with this on. 
(Ben pulls a tam-o'-shanter over his face.) 
DOCTOR: I would like a hat like that. 
POLLY: Nevertheless, we're not going to let you two out of our sights, are we, Kirsty? Well, you get into such terrible trouble without us. 
DOCTOR: Very well, you shall come in the rowing boat. It might be a good idea at that. 
BEN: Well, what do you want me to do now? 
DOCTOR: I've got another idea for you, Ben.

[Annabelle's hold]

WILLY: I can hardly believe it. They've played right into Solicitor Grey's hands. My own crew amongst them. 
COLIN: Can you blame them? It's a poor choice between the gallows and the plantations. A man will clutch at any straw to save his skin. 
JAMIE: And what will they do with us, sir? 
COLIN: I fear they will make an example of us, once Trask gets away to sea. 
WILLY: He'll not let me live, that's for sure. Ach well, better a fast death than a lingering one under the overseers. I've no regrets. 
COLIN: If I could see my Kirsty again, I'd die content.

[Captain's cabin]

GREY: Three thousand five hundred guineas. You will collect this amount in gold on delivery of the prisoners and render strict accounting to me. Is that clear? 
PERKINS: Yes, sir, Mister Grey, sir. Quite clear, sir. You may trust me to the death, sir. 
GREY: Now I must return ashore. I shall expect to see you in London at the end of October. Meanwhile, keep a close eye on Trask. He's not 
TRASK [OC]: Right lads, bring him down. 
(Trask flings open the door and the Doctor is dragged in.) 
DOCTOR: Want to see him. 
TRASK: Us has got company, Mister Solicitor. Caught him coming over the side, bold as a welsh pirate. 
DOCTOR: (German) And of my own free will. I'm delighted to meet you again, Mister Solicitor Grey. 
GREY: You may not be so delighted when we part company this time, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: If you'd ask these fellows to let go of my arms, I have a small token for you. 
GREY: Indeed. I have not forgotten the last one. All right, let him go. 
TRASK: Let me have him. I'll soon change his tune. 
GREY: Silence! Perkins, the door. 
PERKINS: Please? 
GREY: Well, go on. 
DOCTOR: Now then, let me see, where did I put it. No, it's not in there. I transferred it from there, into this pocket. Well it's not there now, perhaps it's in here. 
TRASK: Why, you! 
GREY: I would advise you to find this token quickly, before I leave you to the tender mercies of Mister Trask. 
DOCTOR: Got it! 
(The Doctor produces Kirsty's ring.) 
DOCTOR: Here we are. Look at the seal. 
GREY: The Stuart arms. 
DOCTOR: Well, Mister Grey? 
GREY: Where did you get this? 
DOCTOR: From the hands of Prince Charles himself. 
GREY: Where, man, where? 
DOCTOR: In prison. 
GREY: I don't follow. 
DOCTOR: It's perfectly easy. Prince Charles disguised himself as a Highlander and was taken prisoner with the rest of the rebels. 
GREY: And where is he now? 
DOCTOR: I wonder what that information would be worth? Now let me see. 
TRASK: I'll burn it out of him. 
GREY: No! How much do you think it to be worth, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Well, shall we say, ten thousand guineas?

[Annabelle's hold]

(Polly and Kirsty bring the rowing boat alongside the ship. Kirsty looks through a gun port. Nothing, so they move on to the next. Further on still, she finally finds her father.) 
KIRSTY [OC]: Father. Father. 
COLIN: Hmm? 
KIRSTY [OC]: Father. 
COLIN: Aye, my child. 
KIRSTY [OC]: Father, listen to me. 
COLIN: I hear you, Kirsty. 
KIRSTY [OC]: Father, it's me. It's Kirsty. I'm here. 
COLIN: (waking) Aye. Ah, I must be dreaming. Kirsty. 
KIRSTY [OC]: Whist, keep your voice down. 
COLIN: Where are you? 
KIRSTY [OC]: I'm outside here, in a boat. 
COLIN: My child, are you well? They havna harmed you? 
KIRSTY [OC]: Father, I'm fine. And you? 
COLIN: Better. A world better for hearing your voice. But you canna stay there. They'll find you. 
KIRSTY [OC]: Here, then, take this. 
(Kirsty passes a pistol through the port hole.) 
COLIN: It's a miracle. I must be in a dream. 
KIRSTY [OC]: Father, it's no dream. We've got arms for all of you and a plan. Can you come closer? Right, now listen.

[Captain's cabin]

GREY: You drive a hard bargain, Doctor, but no matter. I agree. Now, where is he? 
DOCTOR: The very last place you would think of looking for him. 
GREY: Well? 
DOCTOR: Right here on this ship. 
TRASK: Let me have him! 
GREY: A dangerous jest! 
DOCTOR: Did you mark the young Highlander who was with me? The piper? 
GREY: Piper? 
DOCTOR: With the soft hands and face? 
GREY: No. 
DOCTOR: Did you notice his hair? Unmistakable, that was the Prince. 
GREY: You had better be very sure. 
DOCTOR: Would I come and place myself in your hands if I was not very sure? 
TRASK: We'll smell out the Pretender right now, by heaven. 
GREY: Come along then. Perkins. 
DOCTOR: Aren't you forgetting one thing? 
GREY: What? 
DOCTOR: I'm the only one who knows what he looks like. 
GREY: Bring him along then. Make haste.

[Annabelle's hold]

(The Highlanders are apparently asleep. Trask enters quietly, followed by Grey, Perkins, the Doctor and two armed sailors.) 
LOOKOUT: (sotto) Go to sleep. 
TRASK: In here, Doctor. 
GREY: Quiet. If they have any suspicion of whom we're looking and know him to be here 
TRASK: Arr. Come on, Doctor. Him? Him? 
DOCTOR: No. 
TRASK: What about him? 
DOCTOR: No. Perhaps he is further over. 
GREY: If you have made a mistake. 
DOCTOR: I've found him. He's the little one, over there. 
(The Doctor points at Jamie, over on the far side.) 
COLIN: Creag an tuire! 
(The Highlanders leap up, armed with sword, pistol and musket. The two sailors try to run but are cut off and surrender. Grey and Perkins do likewise. Only Trask tries to fight, so Willy comes forward to take his revenge.) 
JAMIE: Creag an tuire! 
(Jamie leads the Highlanders out on deck. Willy is weakening in the fight, but manages to stab Trask's shoulder.) 
WILLY: Now I shall relieve you of your command! 
TRASK: Not yet, Willy MacKay! 
(Trask wounds him and heads up on deck.)

[Annabelle's deck]

(The fighting continues with the sailors being driven back to the poop deck.) 
TRASK: Right, lads, to me! Throw the scurvy swabs over the side! I'm still master here! 
BEN: Not for long, mate. 
TRASK: You! I'll make sure of you this time, lad. 
(Trask advances on Ben, cutlass raised. Ben trips and falls. Jamie swings across on a rope and knocks Trask down. Ben gets out of the way as Jamie forces Trask to the ship's rail, where he goes overboard as Willy comes on deck.) 
WILLY: Where's Trask? 
JAMIE: In the firth. 
WILLY: Good lad. Hold! Come back! Hold! All of ye. I want men. Get them over here. That's right, we sail for France on the next tide. I want willing hands. If you hadn't volunteered you'd have had a long cold swim for it. Right now, make ready. Off with ye, go on! Up to the top. Off with ye! 
(As the sailors set to, the Doctor comes on deck and helps Kirsty and Polly on board.) 
DOCTOR: Ben, well done, well done, well done. Kirsty, here's your father. There we are. Polly 
KIRSTY: Father! 
DOCTOR: Got lost in the fog. 
POLLY: Well done, well done. 
BEN: Oh, don't over do it, Pol. 
POLLY: But we've won! 
DOCTOR: Only for the moment. 
POLLY: What do you mean? 
BEN: Well, the real job's only just beginning. Getting back to the Tardis with only a rough idea of where it is and the whole English army out to stop us. 
POLLY: What are we going to do? 
BEN: Well, we're going to get ashore before they get under way. That's the first thing. Right, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Right. 
WILLY: Stand by the capstan. 
DOCTOR: We have to go ashore now. 
WILLY: Oh, don't bother me now, man. Stand by at the end of the rope here. 
COLIN: What about the prisoners? 
DOCTOR: We'll take Mister Grey ashore as a hostage. 
COLIN: And the clerk? 
DOCTOR: Well I 
PERKINS: Now, may I have converse with you. 
COLIN: Yea, man, yea. 
PERKINS: Don't send me ashore with that man, sir. Now, if you are going to France, then maybe you can do with a secretary. Especially one who is conversant with the French tongue. 
COLIN: Shifting with the wind, you rogue. Well, Doctor, what do you say? 
DOCTOR: Many of your people speak French? 
COLIN: Aye, but little. 
DOCTOR: Then take him with you. He'll stay loyal enough. 
PERKINS: Oh, I will, I will, sir. 
DOCTOR: Till the wind shifts again. Laird, we must go. 
COLIN: Doctor, I 
DOCTOR: Bring the prisoner over! 
PERKINS: Mister Solicitor! 
GREY: Well, Perkins? 
(Perkins snaps his fingers at Grey.) 
PERKINS: I've been wanting to do that for a long time. You've no idea the pleasure that gave me. 
GREY: Why you 
PERKINS: Sir.

[Quayside]

POLLY: I can't even see the ship. 
BEN: No, they said they'd send us a signal before they went. Hey, look. There it is! 
(A small light waves across the firth and vanishes.) 
POLLY: Do you think they'll beat the English blockade? 
DOCTOR: The fog will help them. More than it will help us. 
POLLY: We never even said goodbye to Jamie. 
BEN: No, he just disappeared. I wonder where he went to. 
JAMIE: Right here. 
BEN: Jamie! 
POLLY: Jamie! 
JAMIE: Aye, himself. 
BEN: Well, why didn't you go with the others? 
JAMIE: Well, let's say I fancied my chances here better. Besides, you'll need someone to guide you through the glen, won't you? 
BEN: How did you know? 
DOCTOR: Glad to have you with us, Jamie. 
POLLY: But won't you be in danger here though? 
JAMIE: Ach, if they can survive here, so can I. 
BEN: Hey, watch it! Quick, through these doors.

[Boathouse]

(Ben and Jamie drag Grey inside as two soldiers appear.) 
POLLY: They're going away. It's all right. 
GREY: Help! 
JAMIE: One more move and you're a dead man. 
DOCTOR: They heard. 
POLLY: But what if they find us? 
DOCTOR: Shh. 
(The soldiers enter, see nothing and turn to leave.) 
GREY: Mmph! 
(Ben and Jamie tackle one Redcoat as the Doctor grapples the other. They overpower the soldiers and knock them out as Grey makes his escape.) 
JAMIE: I'm certainly glad I'm on your side. 
DOCTOR: Grey! 
POLLY: The window! 
DOCTOR: No. No, Ben. It's too late. 
BEN: But he was our hostage. They'll never let us get to the Tardis now! 
DOCTOR: We'll find someone else, eh, Polly?

[Outside the Sea Eagle Inn]

FFINCH: What the? 
(He turns to see Ben holding a pistol to his chest.) 
BEN: We want your company, mate. 
DOCTOR: If you don't mind. 
POLLY: You won't refuse us, Algy dear. 
FFINCH: Oh, this is really too much. 
POLLY: This way. 
COLONEL: Damn it, man. Where the devil do you think you're going? 
FFINCH: Colonel! 
COLONEL: Well, have you forgotten it's your deal, Ffinch? 
FFINCH: Yes, sir, I know. But, I was just 
COLONEL: Well, who are these vagabonds? 
FFINCH: Well, Colonel they're 
DOCTOR: (German) Doctor von Wer at your service. Remedies for the ague, the twitch, the colic, the warts and the gout. 
COLONEL: The gout? I haven't got the gout. 
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't waste your time with that, a fine healthy gentleman like yourself. No, it's this ring you see, sir. 
FFINCH: Perhaps we'd better get back to the game, sir. The night air. 
COLONEL: Oh, blast the night air. Let me see. The Pretender's ring! Where'd you get this, man? 
DOCTOR: Well, you go up there and to the left. No perhaps it's better to explain this way. To the right 
COLONEL: Look what are you talking about? 
DOCTOR: No. On second thought, perhaps the other way. We were taking the Lieutenant, you see, sir. 
FFINCH: The game, sir. 
COLONEL: Confound the game, this is the Prince's ring. Go with them. Take an attachment. 
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, sir. 
COLONEL: What? 
DOCTOR: That might frighten the blackguard, sir. We are enough to apprehend him. 
COLONEL: All right, go on, Lieutenant. You have your orders, what are you waiting for? 
FFINCH: Yes, sir. But, this wench 
(Polly starts to pull out Ffinch's ID disc which she is wearing around her neck.) 
FFINCH: Yes, sir. Very good, sir. 
COLONEL: And when you have them 
DOCTOR: We will bring him back to you, sir. Right? 
COLONEL: Right.

[Cottage]

(Almost dawn.) 
JAMIE: You know where you are now? 
BEN: Yeah, I won't forget this place in a hurry. 
DOCTOR: Well, it's time we said goodbye, Lieutenant. And thank you. 
POLLY: I've been telling him all about Mister Grey's activities. 
BEN: Yeah, you want to nab him quick. 
POLLY: Oh, Algy, here you are and thank you very much. 
(Polly gives Ffinch his ID disc.) 
FFINCH: It was nothing. 
(Suddenly Redcoats appear and Grey walks in.) 
GREY: Ah, so you found these rebels, Lieutenant? Well done. 
FFINCH: No! 
GREY: You can escort them with me to Inverness. You will not escape the gallows this time, Doctor. Any of you. As for you, wench, I'll have you tied to the tail of a cart and whipped from one end of 
FFINCH: Silence! 
GREY: What was that you said? 
FFINCH: I've heard the whole story of your schemes from this young lady here. 
GREY: You take the word of this 
DOCTOR: What wicked times we live in, Lieutenant. A prison commissioner using his office to smuggle rebels out of the country. 
GREY: You're wasting your breath, Doctor. It was all perfectly legal. The rebels signed the contracts for transportation of their own free will. 
DOCTOR: Contracts? I don't believe I saw any contracts. Did you, Ben? 
BEN: No, I wouldn't know what they were. 
DOCTOR: Or you Jamie? 
JAMIE: Me? No. 
GREY: A lie, Lieutenant. The contracts were signed, I have them right here in my 
DOCTOR: So sad. Once a promising legal talent. 
FFINCH: There is only one end for slave traders, Solicitor. I'm placing you under arrest. 
GREY: I warn you, Lieutenant 
FFINCH: I've had enough of your warnings, sir. Gag him, Sergeant. Take him to prison under escort. 
SERGEANT: Sir! 
GREY: No, wait! This is some sort of trick, you fool. If the Colonel hears of this you'll be lucky to end up as a band master. 
FFINCH: Take him away, Sergeant. 
SERGEANT: Come on, you traitorous dog. 
GREY: Fool. 
SERGEANT: You men follow me. 
(The Redcoats remove Grey.) 
FFINCH: Well, goodbye, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Goodbye. 
BEN: Goodbye. 
POLLY: Wait. Algy, why did you do it? 
FFINCH: A chance to put paid to a villain, ma'am. 
POLLY: It wasn't just that, was it? 
FFINCH: Not quite, ma'am. 
POLLY: Thank you, Algy. (kiss) Goodbye. 
FFINCH: Well, I wouldn't linger here if I were you. These moors, you know, they're still scouring them for rebels. 
DOCTOR: Goodbye. 
FFINCH: Goodbye. 
BEN: Ta-ta. 
JAMIE: One thing I don't understand. Where those contracts went? 
DOCTOR: I've no idea. 
(The Doctor pulls the papers from his pocket.) 
DOCTOR: Well how did they get there? 
BEN: You old fraud. Come on, we must go. 
POLLY: What about Jamie? We can't leave him here. 
DOCTOR: True. His ship's sailed. 
POLLY: What will you do? 
JAMIE: Oh, I'll be all right. They won't catch me. 
BEN: Did you hear that! They'll catch us all if we don't move fast. 
POLLY: Doctor, can we take him with us? 
DOCTOR: If he teaches me to play the bagpipes. 
JAMIE: If you want, Doctor. 
BEN: That's all we need. Come on. 
POLLY: Come on, Jamie. 
JAMIE: But where are we going? 
POLLY: You'll see.

[Culloden moor]

(The travellers return to the Tardis, and Jamie watches in amazement as the Doctor unlocks the blue box and goes inside, followed by Ben. Jamie hesitates, so Polly takes his hand and leads him in.)

[Tardis]

(Polly has led Jamie from Culloden moor into the Tardis. The doors close and the dematerialisation sequence starts.) 
JAMIE: What's this? 
DOCTOR: You'll find out. 
JAMIE: Ah, I don't think I want to. 
BEN: It's a machine, my old haggis, which will take us away from Scotland forever. 
JAMIE: Where to? 
BEN: Ah, well, that as the Doctor would say, that is in the lap of the gods. We never know. 
JAMIE: Aye, you'd not be leading me on now, would you? Is it a fact you don't know where we're going? 
POLLY: Quite true, and what's more we don't even know what year it will be either. 
JAMIE: Ach now, I don't believe it. 
DOCTOR: Nae man can tether time nor tide. Robert Burns.
(From Tam O'Shanter.) 
JAMIE: Ay? Who's Robert Burns? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I should have remembered. 
POLLY: What? 
DOCTOR: Well to Jamie, its 1746. Robert Burns wasn't born until 1759. 
BEN: Gets sort of complicated, don't it? 
JAMIE: What's happening now? 
BEN: We're just beginning to land. 
DOCTOR: Hold tight, everyone. 
JAMIE: Land? 
POLLY: Don't be scared, Jamie, it's all right really. 
BEN: I get a sort of queer feeling. See we never know what we're going to find, do we? 
DOCTOR: Ah, that's the fun. Stand by, here we go. 
POLLY: Please let it be Chelsea 1966. 
BEN: Hope it's the Daleks, I don't think. 
DOCTOR: Prehistoric monsters. 
JAMIE: What have I come upon? 
(The Tardis materialises.) 
JAMIE: That wasn't too bad. Let's go outside, Doctor. 
BEN: Yeah, come on, Jamie, you and me first. Well, you never know, you know. 
JAMIE: What? 
BEN: We don't know what's going to be waiting for us out there, do we? Come on, Doctor, open up. 
DOCTOR: Yes, I don't see why not. It looks all right to me. (The doors open.) Wait! 
(The Doctor grabs his stove-pipe hat.) 
DOCTOR: For me.

[Beach].

(It's a rocky sea shore.) 
POLLY: This time I'll guess where we are. 
DOCTOR: All right then, where are we? 
POLLY: Cornwall. 
BEN: Ah, you said that last time. 
POLLY: And I was right. 
JAMIE: The Isles, maybe. 
BEN: Don't you know? 
DOCTOR: Haven't a clue. Not the isles of Britain, anyway. 
POLLY: How can you tell? 
DOCTOR: This rock. It's volcanic. It's not very old either. 
BEN: How old? 
DOCTOR: Oh, miocene. 
BEN + POLLY: What? 
DOCTOR: It's only about 25 million years old. Look. 
(Inland, a mountainous peak rises high above them.) 
BEN: Hey, that's an extinct volcano, isn't it? 
DOCTOR: Possibly, possibly. 
JAMIE: Are we not going for a wee look round? 
POLLY: Yes, lets. Come on. 
(Polly, Ben and Jamie head off up the side of the volcano.) 
POLLY: Oh, give us a hand. 
BEN: Here. 
(The higher they go, the steeper the slope. On the beach, the Doctor takes out his pocket watch and checks the time against the position of the sun)

[Mountainside]

(The group stop for a rest half way up.) 
BEN: I don't reckon we're going to see much when we get there. 
POLLY: Ben? 
BEN: What now? 
POLLY: I'm beginning to see things. 
BEN: Where? 
POLLY: Down there, look. I'm sure I saw something moving. 
BEN: Ah, you're round the twist. 
POLLY: Look, there it is again. 
BEN: You see anything? 
JAMIE: Nothing. 
POLLY: Ben, I think we ought to go back. 
BEN: No, not me, I'm having a dekko down here. 
JAMIE: Yeah, me too. 
POLLY: Wait for me! 
(Polly struggles after the men. They stop again just below the summit.) POLLY: Oh, can't we stop and have a breather? 
JAMIE: Ben and I'll go on. You stay here. 
POLLY: Oh, no. 
BEN: We shan't be long, love, back before you know it. 
POLLY: All right. 
(Polly looks at the view. They are on the largest of a chain of islands, some no more than large rocks. The ocean surrounds them in all directions. The sound of falling pebbles lures Polly to a cave entrance a short distance away. She goes inside. It is dark, but once her eyes have acclimatised Polly sees an elaborate bracelet on the floor, with a design of a kneeling figure holding a burning torch. She bends to pick it up and a shadow falls over her. Polly screams.) 
BEN: Hey, that's Polly. 
(Ben and Jamie run back to where they left Polly.) 
BEN: Polly? Polly? 
(Jamie spots the cave entrance.) 
JAMIE: She must have gone inside. 
BEN: Hang on, I've got a torch.

[Cave]

BEN: Polly?

[Beach]

(The Doctor has finished his calculations and is looking around carefully in the rock pools. He finds some shards of pottery.) 
DOCTOR: Mediterranean. Oh no, tidal sea, can't be. That's funny, it hasn't been fired long. 
(The Doctor puts the pottery into his pocket and goes to find the others.)

[Tunnel].

BEN: Polly? 
(In the cave, Ben and Jamie find a tunnel leading deeper into the mountain.) 
BEN: Polly, where are you? 
JAMIE: Polly? 
BEN: What's that? 
(A weighted net falls onto them and they are pushed into a metal cage hanging over a pit.)

[Cage]

POLLY: Ben, Jamie, is it you? 
BEN: Who do you think it is? 
JAMIE: Are you all right, Polly? 
POLLY: Yes. 
BEN: When you're finished get us out of this contraption. 
POLLY: I can't. They've tied me up. 
JAMIE: Who are they? 
POLLY: I don't know, I didn't see them. 
(The door opens and another person is pushed into the cage with them.) 
BEN: That's all we needed. 
DOCTOR: So they caught you too. 
(The cage lurches and descends. The wind whistles past them.) 
BEN: Left half me stomach behind. 
JAMIE: Aye, me too. 
POLLY: Where are we going? 
DOCTOR: That we shall find out very soon. 
POLLY: Wherever it is it's an awful long way down. 
DOCTOR: Yes, we must be below sea level already. 
JAMIE: It's difficult to breathe. 
BEN: What is it, Doctor? 
POLLY: It's a funny taste. I don't feel very well. 
DOCTOR: Here we are. 
(The Doctor unties Polly.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, don't be frightened anybody. If we pass out it's compressed nitrogen. It's called caissons disease. 
BEN: Polly, try and get us out of here. 
POLLY: I'll try. 
(Polly struggles with the net, but passes out. The cage reaches the bottom of the shaft. All four are unconscious as four guards in primitive clothes take them to a small chamber and lie them out of padded benches to recover.)

[Chamber]

DOCTOR: Oh. 
BEN: Where's this? Polly? Jamie? 
JAMIE: Oh. 
BEN: Come on, man, rise and shine. 
JAMIE: Would you disturb the dead. 
BEN: Oh you're not dead, you just got a touch of the submariners', that's all. 
JAMIE: What are they? 
BEN: It'd take too long to explain now. This must be some sort of compression chamber. 
DOCTOR: Troglodytes. 
BEN: What? 
DOCTOR: Ancient tribes from North Africa who lived in caves. Possibly, possibly. Where's my diary? 
BEN: Cave men? Hey, Jamie, you better watch it. With that kilt someone might mistake you for a bird. 
JAMIE: What? 
(Polly wakes, groaning.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, it's difficult to put a precise date on these people. 
POLLY: I don't think it is. 
DOCTOR: All right then, when? 
POLLY: Oh, I'd say about 1970. 
DOCTOR: Can you prove it? 
BEN: Yeah, go on, prove it. 
JAMIE: How d'you know, Polly? 
BEN: Ah, she's been studying her crystal ball. 
POLLY: Abracadabra. 
(Polly produces the bracelet she found.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, how interesting, yes. Hmm. It's Aztec. Fake of course. 
BEN: Mexico Olympiad. 
POLLY: When we first left Earth it hadn't happened yet. 
BEN: No, that's right, it wasn't due till 1968. 
POLLY: Right, so now is any time later than that. 
JAMIE: Later? Oh, I wish I understood. 
(The door opens. A guard carrying a trident enters.) 
BEN: Polly, you speak foreign. Go and talk to him. Ask him where we are. 
POLLY: Er, parlez-vous francais? Sprechen Sie deutsch? Habla si espanol? 
GUARD: Bazumi tampost postu! 
JAMIE: Au Gaelic akye? 
BEN: What's that? 
JAMIE: Gaelic. 
(The guards prods them to the door with his trident.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that means move in any language. I think we'd better comply. Women and children last. Polly?

[Reception area].

(Guards line the corridor to the small room where a table is being laid with food. The Doctor tries some.) 
DOCTOR: Oh food. 
(The guard raises his weapon to hit the serving girl, so the Doctor accidentally gets in the way.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm so sorry. Thank you. 
(The girl smiles and leaves hurriedly.) 
DOCTOR: This is good. 
(The guard leaves by another door.) 
DOCTOR: This is very good. Mmmm. It's delicious. This is excellent. Sit down, sit down. This is ambrosia. 
BEN: What's got into him? 
POLLY: I don't know. I've never seen him go for food like this before. It's usually hats. 
JAMIE: Better hurry or he'll scoff the lot. 
(But they don't share his enthusiasm for the cuisine.) 
BEN: What is it? 
DOCTOR: Plankton. 
JAMIE: Plankton? What's that? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's small plants and animals from the sea. 
POLLY: Animals? 
BEN: Yeah, little spidery ones. 
POLLY: Oh, I don't think I'm very hungry, thank you. 
DOCTOR: You'd better get used to it. I don't expect there's much else to be had around here. Visitors! 
(A striking figure in splendid robes sweeps into the room.) 
DOCTOR: Good day to you. 
(He is a priest, and is accompanied by guards.) 
RAMO: We've been expecting you. 
POLLY: He speaks English. 
BEN: What does he mean, he's been expecting us? We didn't know we were coming ourselves. 
RAMO: The living goddess Amdo sees and hears all. 
DOCTOR: And she had a message about us? For you? 
RAMO: Yes. She told us you would fall from the sky in time for our festival of the vernal equinox. 
DOCTOR: And just what part are we to play in this festival of the vernal equinox? 
RAMO: A very important part, I regret to say. Guards. 
(There's a scuffle.) 
DOCTOR: No! Wait! I have something important to say. 
RAMO: Be quick and say it then. 
DOCTOR: I won't speak under threats! 
RAMO: You have five minutes in which to make your point. After that you will join your companions. The ceremony will proceed. 
POLLY: Doctor? 
RAMO: Go, girl. 
DOCTOR: What will happen to them? 
RAMO: They will come to no harm. Yet. 
DOCTOR: You'll have to go, Polly. 
(The guards take Ben, Polly and Jamie away.) 
RAMO: Now, stranger, say what you have to and do not waste time. There is very little of it left for any of you. 
DOCTOR: What I have to say concerns a certain Professor Zaroff. 
RAMO: What do you know of Zaroff? 
DOCTOR: A great deal. He's here, isn't he? 
RAMO: How did you know? 
DOCTOR: The food. It couldn't be anyone else but Zaroff. He led the field in producing food from the sea. His progress is astonishing. 
RAMO: You are a friend of Zaroff's? 
DOCTOR: Just send him this message, and you'll see. 
(The Doctor takes out a pencil and paper.) 
RAMO: I will take no message to Zaroff. 
DOCTOR: You're making a big mistake! 
(The serving girl returns.) 
RAMO: Yes, what is it, Ara? 
ARA: I've come to clear the table. 
RAMO: Yes, yes, we've wasted enough time. 
DOCTOR: Ara, take this message to Professor Zaroff. 
ARA: But I

[Temple of Amdo]

(It is a cavernous space with a vaulted roof supported by carved pillars cut from the rock. There is a large idol of the goddess, a fish-woman hybrid. Her altar is lit by burning braziers and tended by priests. In the centre is a platform with four beams radiating out from its centre. Polly, Ben and Jamie are dragged before the altar.) 
POLLY: I'm scared. What are they going to do to us? 
JAMIE: I don't see the Doctor here. He's escaped, maybe. 
BEN: Ah, some chance of that. 
JAMIE: Oh, he's a canny one, yon Doctor. Dinna fash yourself, Polly. 
RAMO: Quiet! You profane the sacred temple with your idle chatter.

[Outside Zaroff's laboratory].

ARA: I must speak to Professor Zaroff. 
(The guard shakes his head.) 
ARA: Well, Damon then.

[Temple of Amdo]

JAMIE: Ben, should we run for it? 
BEN: No, wait till we hear from the Doctor. 
POLLY: It'd be better. 
(Acolytes bind them hand and foot then hoist them up and carry them to the platform. The priest removes a cover to reveal a deep well and shark infested waters below. Ben, Polly and Jamie are laid on the beams so their heads are together at the centre, pointing towards the well.) 
JAMIE: Put me down. 
POLLY: Ben? The Doctor isn't coming! 
BEN: Don't worry. As long as he's not here, there's still some hope. 
(Ramo escorts the Doctor in.) 
BEN: Oh, no. 
(The Doctor is led to the dais.)

[Surgeon's lab]

(Ara has been allowed to see the Chief Surgeon.) 
DAMON: Well, girl, what do you want? Why are you not at your work? 
ARA: I have a note for Professor Zaroff. It's very important. 
DAMON: A note for Zaroff? Let me see. Oh, come, girl.

[Temple of Amdo]

(The beams are held in place by ropes fastened to earthenware jars full of water as counterweights. The High Priest puts on the fish mask and speaks.) 
LOLEM: Life is a stream of water that drains away even as time does, and cannot be reclaimed. 
(A boy removes a stopper from each jar.) 
LOLEM: Accept, oh mighty and powerful Amdo, these, your sacrifices. 
(As the water flows from the jars, the beams start to tilt down into the shark pool.) 
POLLY: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Hold on! Hold on for your lives.

[Zaroff's laboratory]

(There is a scorpion fish in a tank.) 
DAMON: Here is the note. 
(It reads 'Vital secret will die with me' and is signed Doctor W. Zaroff crumples it)

[Temple of Amdo]

(The water continues to come out of the jars and the travellers slide slowly down the beams. Polly screams.) 
DOCTOR: Don't move. Don't even breathe. 
(Zaroff runs in.) 
ZAROFF: Stop the ceremony! 
RAMO: You dare to interfere with the hour of sacrifice? 
ZAROFF: I do not interfere with your sacrifices, but I must first speak with that man. Release him. 
RAMO: Release him. 
(Acolytes obey and help the Doctor to his feet.) 
ZAROFF: Now, this information you have, what is it? 
DOCTOR: First, release my friends. 
ZAROFF: I do not care about your friends. Your information, quick! 
DOCTOR: But I do. Professor Zaroff, if anything happens to them, you'll never know the secret I was going to tell you. 
ZAROFF: You! All right, release them. Take them to the labour controller. He will know what to do with them. Well, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: First, let me say how glad I am to see that the reports of your death twenty years previously are a little premature. 
ZAROFF: The whole world believed I had been kidnapped. 
DOCTOR: The East blamed the West. The West, the East. 
ZAROFF: Oh, I wish I could have been there. 
DOCTOR: Now here you are, the greatest scientific genius since Leonardo, under the sea. You must have a fantastic story to tell? 
ZAROFF: Perhaps I tell you someday, if you will live long enough to hear. Now this vital secret, what is it? I must know. 
(The Doctor makes sure that the others have been taken away.) 
DOCTOR: I haven't got one. 
ZAROFF: How dare you! 
DOCTOR: But I'm sure a that great man like you wouldn't want a modern scientific brain like mine to be sacrificed to a heathen idol? 
ZAROFF: You know I could have you torn to bits by my guards, yes? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZAROFF: I could feed you to my pet octopus, yes? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZAROFF: Well you have sense of humour. I too have sense of humour. I need men like you. (both laugh) You come with me, yes? 
DOCTOR: I come with you.

[Operating theatre]

(Jamie, Ben and Polly have been put in Damon's custody.) 
DAMON: Your lives have been spared. See that they contribute useful service to the community. 
BEN: Anything you say, mate. 
DAMON: What was that? 
BEN: Oh, nothing, nothing. 
DAMON: You men look strong. You'll be sent to the mines. Take them away. 
BEN: What? 
JAMIE: What does he mean, mines? 
BEN: Now wait a minute. Now what are you going to do with her? 
POLLY: Yes, what? 
DAMON: I shall decide that later. 
(Jamie and Ben are dragged out.) 
JAMIE: Don't lose heart, Polly! 
DAMON: Don't be afraid, girl. Life is very beautiful under the sea. Come along. 
(A shutter slides up to reveal the seabed lit by floodlights. Shadowy figures swim to and fro.) 
DAMON: Seventy percent of the world's surface is under the oceans. You are looking at our food producing area. Without it, we couldn't survive. 
POLLY: It's fantastic. What are those? 
DAMON: Those are our farmers. 
POLLY: I think it's splendid. All those people working under the sea to feed the others. But listen, how do they breathe? 
DAMON: We give them plastic gills. Look. 
(One of the fish people swims close to the window, peering in.) 
DAMON: That surprises you, doesn't it? 
POLLY: It's breathtaking. Oh, sorry. That wasn't meant to be a pun. 
DAMON: No, not at all. No, I'm glad you're taking it like this. Some people get most upset when they find they're to have the operation. 
POLLY: Operation? 
FOREMAN: Well, of course. We couldn't send you out there without it. You'd drown. 
POLLY: You're not turning me into a fish!

[Corridor].

DOCTOR: Just give me a clue, Professor. 
ZAROFF: West of Gibraltar, south of the Azores. The Atlantic ridge, what does that suggest to you? 
DOCTOR: Ancient temples under the sea. But that's not possible! That's only a legend. 
ZAROFF: Go on, go on, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: We're on the ancient kingdom of Atlantis. 
ZAROFF: Yes, yes, and this is not the perfect place to complete my work? 
DOCTOR: But how did you get them to accept you? Surely science is in opposition to ancient temple ritual and idol worship? 
ZAROFF: I gave them a sugar-coated pill. I have promised to lift Atlantis out of the sea. 
(A guard is waiting.) 
ZAROFF: Yes, what is it? Pardon me, Doctor. 
ARA: Doctor? Doctor? 
DOCTOR: What is it, Ara? 
ARA: It's the girl. They're going to carry out the fish operation on her. 
DOCTOR: Fish operation? Well, well, well. Ara, do you know where the main fuses are? 
ARA: Fuses? 
DOCTOR: Oh, never mind. Go back to Polly, and if the chance comes, get her away from there! Will you do that for me? 
ARA: Yes. 
ZAROFF: Doctor!

[Operating theatre].

(Polly has been dressed for surgery.) 
POLLY: Keep away! 
DAMON: Bring her here. 
(She is dragged to the operating table.) 
DAMON: Don't be difficult, girl, it's quite painless. Lights. 
POLLY: No! no! 
DAMON: We're ready now. 
POLLY: No! No! No! No! No! No! 
(Damon looms over her with a huge hypodermic syringe.) 
DAMON: One tiny jab, and you'll know nothing more about it until it's all over.

Episode Two

[Zaroff's laboratory]

ZAROFF: And so you see, my friend, it is all so simple. When Atlantis was submerged at the time of the flood, some life continued in air pockets in the mountain's caves, thanks to the natural air shaft provided by the extinct volcano. 
(The Doctor has a pair of wire-cutters behind his back.) 
ZAROFF: You like my laboratory, yes? You find all this very impressive, no? 
DOCTOR: No, not a bit, not a bit. 
ZAROFF: What do you mean? 
(The Doctor backs up to a power distribution panel, wire-cutters at the ready.) 
DOCTOR: I expected nothing less from the great Professor Zaroff.

[Operating room]

(Before Polly can be injected.) 
DAMON: The lights are playing up again. Go and see what's wrong. No, wait. I'd better go myself. Zaroff might listen to me. Look after the girl. 
NURSE: Right.

[Zaroff's laboratory]

ZAROFF: Yes, we have come a long way in our research, and luckily the riches of Atlantis have provided ample means. 
(He goes over to his pet octopus tank.) 
ZAROFF: Ah, so you are hungry today? Did I forget to feed you? Is beautiful, no? 
(Damon enters.) 
DAMON: Zaroff! 
ZAROFF: Not now, Damon. Can't you see I am talking with my friend here. 
DAMON: This won't wait. If I am to operate on the girl, I must have light. 
ZAROFF: One operation, one girl. You are making an unnecessary fuss. 
DAMON: I know what's going on. You're using so much voltage on the project that all civil use is curtailed. 
ZAROFF: Ridiculous. I will show you. You follow me. Open the panel. Ridiculous. There is nothing wrong with the civil supply. There's never anything wrong. Look, the supply to your clinic is always adequate and cannot be affected by demands elsewhere. 
DAMON: Zaroff! 
ZAROFF: The fault must lie at your own intake. 
DAMON: It's easy to make excuses. 
ZAROFF: Excuses! Who taught you, Damon? Everything you know, I've taught you. As I made you, so I can break you.

[Operating room]

(The room is plunged into darkness.) 
NURSE: So Zaroff will listen to him. You'd better go and get some light from somewhere. You'll find some in the old quarters. Don't worry, prisoner, we won't keep you waiting long. Ah, you, girl, come here. Keep watch on the prisoner while I search for fuses. And don't try any tricks, understand, or it will be worse for you. 
ARA: I understand. 
(The two men leave, and Ara starts unstrapping Polly from the operating table.) 
ARA: Girl? 
POLLY: What? 
ARA: Don't speak, just follow me. 
POLLY: But I can't see anything. 
ARA: Hold my hand. I'm used to the dark. Hurry, before they get back.

[Zaroff's laboratory]

(The Doctor's tampering has been noticed. He steps away from the power supply panel.) 
DOCTOR: I can't think of how I came to be so clumsy. I must have bumped into it. 
DAMON: You're not clumsy, Doctor. You did it on purpose. But you won't save the girl. 
(Damon leaves, and the Doctor tries to follow.) 
ZAROFF: Oh no, Doctor, you are staying here with me. 
DOCTOR: As your prisoner? 
ZAROFF: Let us say as my guest.

[Tunnel]

ARA: It's all clear, come on. 
POLLY: Oh, I feel as though I've run a hundred miles. But where? 
ARA: I know where to hide you. Come on.

[Zaroff's laboratory]

ZAROFF: Damon? Ha, he's just an Atlantean, a primitive. Clever, but no vision. 
DOCTOR: Professor, you have offered these people a very big sugar-coated pill to make them accept you, yes? 
ZAROFF: I turned their dreams and prophecies to my own means. 
DOCTOR: The dreams of a people living on a drowned continent must be. 
ZAROFF: To lift Atlantis from the ocean. Make it dry land again. 
DOCTOR: Exactly. But now, how are you going to do it? Even a genius like you. 
ZAROFF: Look. Atlantis underwater. 
(Zaroff shows the Doctor a model of the city in an aquarium tank.) 
DOCTOR: A very large mass to lift. 
ZAROFF: If I can't lift it then I must lower the water level. You see the valve there? 
DOCTOR: Yes, may I? 
ZAROFF: Please. 
(The Doctor pulls the plug from the tank.)
ZAROFF: Simple, isn't it? 
DOCTOR: Yes, but you haven't got a drain big enough to take an ocean. 
ZAROFF: Then I will make one. 
DOCTOR: You'll forgive me. I'm a little lost. The crust of the Earth is more than a hundred miles thick. Below that is believed to be a white-hot molten core. Now where is your ocean going to go? 
ZAROFF: That is my secret. 
DOCTOR: Oh, now you're making fun of me, Professor. 
ZAROFF: No, no. 
DOCTOR: Even supposing you could drill to the depth of a hundred miles. 
ZAROFF: There is a place where a fissure reduces the distance to less than fifteen miles. 
DOCTOR: It's still an enormous obstacle. 
ZAROFF: But not insurmountable. We have been working on it for many years. 
DOCTOR: Even if. 
ZAROFF: Excuse me, I have been interrupted. 
(Holding up a bag of food, Zaroff returns to his pet octopus.) 
DOCTOR: But Professor? 
ZAROFF: Yes? 
DOCTOR: Even supposing you succeeded, you know what will happen, don't you? 
ZAROFF: You tell me, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Well, the water will be converted into superheated steam, the pressure will grow, and crack the crust of the Earth. Destroy all life, maybe even blow the planet apart. 
ZAROFF: Yes. And I shall have redeemed my promise to lift Atlantis from the sea. Lift it to the sky! It will be magnificent. 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
ZAROFF: Bang! Bang! Bang, bang! That's all. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Just one small question. Why do you want to blow up the world? 
ZAROFF: Why? You, a scientist, ask me why? The achievement, my dear Doctor. The destruction of the world. The scientists' dream of supreme power!

[Mine]

(Deep below the city. The drills make a high pitched screech that hurts the ears.) 
FOREMAN: Only four loads today? You'll have to increase output or you'll be joining our fish friends. All right, get on with it. 
(A guard brings Jamie and Ben.) 
FOREMAN: I've another two for you. All right, this way, follow me. 
(They go over to where two workers are talking and not working.)  
FOREMAN: What's this? 
SEAN: Huh? 
FOREMAN: Slacking? 
SEAN: (Irish, of course) Oh, I'm sorry I can't hear a word you're saying. Splitting with the noise. 
FOREMAN: What have you got there? 
JACKO: Who, me? 
FOREMAN: Guard! 
(Jacko palms off a small object to Sean.) 
FOREMAN: Search that man. 
(Unseen, Sean throws it to Jamie, who hides it in his plaid.) 
GUARD: Nothing here. 
FOREMAN: Search the other. 
(Sean is ticklish, and giggles.) 
GUARD: Nothing on this one either. 
FOREMAN: All right, this time you're lucky. These two have just joined us. Teach them to be useful. 
(The foreman leaves with the guard.) 
JACKO: That was close. What is it? 
(Jamie gives it back to Sean.) 
BEN: What's the secret about a compass? 
SEAN: It's as important as eyes down here. Thanks, chum. If they had found that on us we'd have been for the high jump, I tell you. 
JAMIE: Why d'ye pass it on to me though? Suppose they'd caught me with it? 
SEAN: Well, they didn't, did they? 
BEN: Are you planning something, then? 
SEAN: That's our business. 
JAMIE: What's the matter with you? Are we not all in the same boat? 
JACKO: That's right, Jock, and we don't want no one to rock it. 
JAMIE: The name happens to be Jamie and I'll just thank you to 
SEAN: Take no notice, he's a bit like that, you see. 
BEN: Hey, watch it. That guard's looking this way. 
SEAN: Oh, well, make out we're working.

[Zaroff's laboratory]

(Zaroff his checking his assistant's work.) 
ZAROFF: Your calculations cannot be correct. Let me see. 
DAMON: Professor? 
ZAROFF: Not now, Damon. Come with me. 
DOCTOR: Ah, Mister Damon, you're back. Did your operation go well? 
DAMON: The girl escaped. 
DOCTOR: Oh dear. How very frustrating for you. 
DAMON: We'll get her back. 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes of course you will. 
(The Doctor goes to a workbench and examines the bottles of chemicals there.) 
DOCTOR: It's very important to you, isn't it? I mean, you want all the human labour you can get, don't you? 
DAMON: Yes. But it's cheap and plentiful. We pick up survivors from shipwrecks who would otherwise be corpses, and convert them to fish people. 
DOCTOR: Amazing. The Professor leads the field in scientific discoveries. What a fantastic conception. To control the world from a test tube. 
DAMON: That's right. 
DOCTOR: Well, two can play at that game. Have you ever seen this? 
(The Doctor picks up two test tubes and pours one into the other. It releases a gas and Damon starts coughing.) 
DAMON: Stop him, stop him. Don't let him get away.

[Temple of Amdo]

ARA: You understand, you must hide on Amdo and wait until I can fetch you. Don't be worried. 
POLLY: Yes, but. 
ARA: And don't make a sound. 
POLLY: No, all right. 
(Ara leaves, and Polly starts climbing the idol to find somewhere to hide.)

[Mine]

(It is time to eat - plankton again.) 
BEN: Don't you ever get sick of this seafood? 
JACKO: You learn to live with it. 
SEAN: Just watch it though, they haven't found any way of keeping it fresh. In a few hours it's putrid. 
JAMIE: Tell me, why do you need a compass? 
SEAN: Oh, there's no point in making a break without one, is there? 
JACKO: Why don't you shout it out to the guard? 
BEN: Look, mate, do yourself a favour and stop treating us as if we're one of them. Look, Jamie and I don't intend to stop here either. 
SEAN: See, I told you. Now come on boys, will you cheer up? 
JACKO: All right, all right. 
BEN: How do you intend going about it? 
JAMIE: Aye, how? There're guards all over. 
BEN: Well, come on, give. 
SEAN: Right. Well, while I was mining a shaft, I came along the entrance to a little underground tunnel like this, you see? 
BEN: I see. 
JAMIE: Where does it lead, though? 
SEAN: Well, we haven't been able to explore it. We'll just have to take a chance. Now if we go, there'll be no turning back. You understand? 
JACKO: We make it or we don't. 
SEAN: Are you with us, then? 
BEN: Yeah, count me in. 
JAMIE: Aye, when do we go? 
JACKO: When the chance comes. 
SEAN: And we jump fast, do y'hear me? 
(The Foreman comes over.) 
FOREMAN: They need extra labour up at the project. You two join the lineup for selection. 
(He moves away.) 
BEN: Now's our chance. We're off. 
SEAN: By Christopher, you're right. If we disappear now they'll think we're gone to the project work gang. Okay, Jacko? 
JACKO: Oh, it'll give us a start anyway. 
BEN: Right, now look, you go first, Jacko. That'll show Jamie and me where the entrance is. Then you go, Sean. 
JAMIE: And then you, then me. 
(A whistle sounds.) 
SEAN: Scatter. 
(The workers form a line, with Sean and Jacko at the far end. Then Jamie joins it.) 
FOREMAN: Right. You, you, you. 
JAMIE: How about me, sir? 
FOREMAN: You're too new. Get out of my way. 
(Jacko has already made his escape before the Foreman turns back to the line-up.) 
FOREMAN: You, you. 
BEN: I volunteer, sir. 
FOREMAN: Too new. 
BEN: Oh, but sir. 
FOREMAN: Go and join your friend. 
(Sean has used the distraction to leave too.) 
FOREMAN: You. 
(Jamie joins the line-up again to conceal Ben leaving.) 
FOREMAN: I thought I told you to get out of my way. 
JAMIE: Oh aye, sir, I'm just going, sir. (Jamie follows Ben.) Thanks, boys. 
(Jamie grabs a torch and goes around the miners to the secret tunnel where the others are waiting.)

[Tunnel]

BEN: Come on, man. We haven't got all day. 
JACKO: Took a long time, didn't he. 
BEN: Yeah. 
SEAN: Is that you? 
JAMIE: Aye. 
BEN: Well come on, hurry up. 
SEAN: And bring the light. 
JAMIE: All right. 
BEN: Look, suppose this don't lead any place, and we want to come back? 
SEAN: Oh, you won't mate. They'll kill runaway workers on sight.

[Corridor]

(The guards are searching for the Doctor and Polly.) 
GUARD: We'd better try the small chamber. 
(The guards move off and the Doctor comes out of a cupboard. He looks at the clothes inside it. They are guard uniforms. He tries on one of the hats.)

[Chamber]

GUARD: Nothing here. The compression chamber next. 
(Ara enters.) 
GUARD: Seen any strangers, girl? 
ARA: No, sir, nobody. 
(The guards leave and the Doctor enters.) 
DOCTOR: Ara? No, wait, Ara. It's me. 
ARA: Oh, it's you. 
DOCTOR: Where's Polly? 
ARA: Safe. I'm taking her some food and clothes. 
DOCTOR: Good girl, well done. Ara, where can I find your Chief of State? 
ARA: In the council chamber, why? 
DOCTOR: I want to talk to him. Can you take me to him? 
ARA: Yes, but he'll hand you over. 
DOCTOR: I'll have to take that risk. 
DAMON [OC]: Stay outside. 
(The Doctor and Ara hide behind a pillar as Ramo and Damon enter, leaving a guard outside the door.) 
DAMON: Keep your eyes skinned for escaped prisoners. 
RAMO: Well, where are the others now? 
DAMON: The two young men are at the mine. The girl is still at large, and so is the Doctor. But we'll find them. They cannot get away. 
RAMO: Now what does Zaroff think about it all? 
DAMON: Oh, he's furious, of course. Could upset his plans. 
RAMO: He should not have interfered with the temple sacrifice. 
DAMON: You've always hated him, Ramo. Why? 
RAMO: He's a destroyer. He appeals to all that is base in our people. He should never have come to Atlantis. 
DAMON: But without him, Atlantis will never rise again from the sea. 
DOCTOR: (sotto) Can you get Damon away? I want to talk to the priest alone. 
ARA: I'll try. 
(Ara comes out of hiding.) 
ARA: If you please? 
RAMO: But not to the same extent. 
ARA: Master? 
DAMON: Yes, yes? 
ARA: I believe I have seen the girl you are looking for. 
DAMON: Where? 
ARA: Down by the market. 
DAMON: Show me. 
(Ara and Damon leave, and the Doctor comes out.) 
DOCTOR: Can I have a word with you, Ramo? 
RAMO: Doctor! Damon! 
DOCTOR: We're both on the same side, Ramo. You distrust Zaroff out of instinct. I distrust him because I know the truth. 
RAMO: Why should I trust you? 
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. I wish I could think of a good answer. 
RAMO: All right, tell me what you know. 
DOCTOR: Can we talk here? 
RAMO: I know a place where we shan't be interrupted.

[Tunnel]

(The men come to a junction.) 
JACKO: Yeah, which way now? 
BEN: This-away, or thataway? 
SEAN: Oh, one is as good as the other. 
JAMIE: Well, let's try fifty paces up each tunnel, then turn back. 
BEN: Yeah. 
JAMIE: Jacko? Oh, I suppose I'll go with you. We'll take the high road. 
JACKO: Oh, let's go then. 
BEN: Which leaves us with 
BEN + SEAN: The low road.

[Temple of Amdo]

(Polly has fallen asleep in the shadows of the idol and doesn't wake as Ramo and the Doctor enter.) 
RAMO: Come this way. We shall not be interrupted here. Now, tell me what you found out about Zaroff. 
DOCTOR: He says that he's going to raise Atlantis, yes? That's not quite true. He intends to destroy Atlantis. 
RAMO: A difficult task. 
DOCTOR: It's easier than raising it. 
RAMO: How will he destroy us? 
DOCTOR: He intends to drill a hole through the earth's crust, and drain away the ocean, yes? 
RAMO: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Have you any idea what will happen if he does that? I'll show you. 
(The Doctor fills a small pot with water.) 
DOCTOR: May I? 
(He seals the lid and places it over a brazier.) 
DOCTOR: This pot is the earth. This is the ocean. The ocean drains into the earth. Now, but the centre of the earth is hot, far hotter than this fire. So what happens? 
RAMO: But this is child's play. What has this to do with Zaroff's project? 
DOCTOR: This pot is Zaroff's project. Watch. Now the pot begins to boil, but the steam can't get out, and so. I think we'd better stand a little further back. Get down! 
(Bang! As the pot blows apart under the pressure of the steam.) 
DOCTOR: This is what will happen. Zaroff intends to raise Atlantis, but in little pieces. 
RAMO: You swear this is true? 
DOCTOR: Well, I thought I might mention it. Of course, if you don't mind being blown up. 
RAMO: Can you stop him? 
DOCTOR: Could I? I am not the ruler of Atlantis. 
RAMO: If I took you to our ruler Thous, could you convince him? 
DOCTOR: I might. 
RAMO: Wait here. 
(Ramo leaves. The Doctor pulls out his recorder and plays.)

[Tunnel]

BEN + SEAN: Thirty eight, thirty nine, forty. 
BEN: Well, what beats me is why Atlantis hasn't been discovered before. 
SEAN: Oh, maybe it has, but nobody got back home to tell the tale. 
BEN: Oh yeah, could be. Hey. 
(They flatten themselves against the wall then jump out on a passing person.) 
JACKO: Hey! It's me. 
SEAN: I'm sorry. You can't be too careful these days. 
BEN: Yeah, but where's Jamie? He went with you. 
JACKO: He's gone on, I came back to collect you and Sean. 
BEN: Now what do we do. We're not even at the end of this one yet. 
SEAN: I think the best thing to do is you go back to Jamie ,and I'll go on and meet you in ten minutes. 
BEN: Oh yeah, but where? 
SEAN: Where? At the, er, at the fork. Okay? 
BEN: Right.

[Temple of Amdo]

(Ramo returns.) 
RAMO: Put this on, could you? 
(He gives the Doctor a cloak.) 
DOCTOR: Could I? 
RAMO: With these robes, no one will challenge you. 
(The Doctor is very taken with the headdress.) 
DOCTOR: How do I look? 
RAMO: What? 
DOCTOR: Never mind.

[Tunnel ledge]

BEN: Jamie! 
JAMIE [OC]: Here. 
BEN: Jamie! 
JAMIE: Down here! 
(Jamie is below them, hanging on for grim death to an outcrop of rock.) 
BEN: Okay, mate. We're with you. Are you hurt? 
JAMIE: No, but watch it. The rock's slippery. 
BEN: Don't worry about us. Just cling on. 
SEAN: How far down is he? 
BEN: About ten feet, I'd say. 
SEAN: What's that in metres? 
BEN: Why don't you get further along there. (Ben lies down and tries to reach out to Jamie.) 
BEN: Can you reach it? Try again. Right. Now the other hand. 
(Jamie moves his weight to his other hand and manages to reach Ben's fingers. Jacko hangs onto Ben's legs as he reaches down with his other hand. As Jamie grabs it, the extra weight makes Ben slide forward.) 
BEN: Oh, Jacko! 
JAMIE: I think I've got a foothold now. 
BEN: All right. 
(But he can't climb up, so Ben and Jacko have to pull Jamie onto the ledge.)

[Temple of Amdo]

(Polly wakes and climbs down the idol.) 
POLLY: Huh. You needn't think I'm afraid of you, you stupid thing. 
(A hidden door opens in the base of the statue and she hides in the shadows.) 
SEAN: Come on, quietly. 
BEN: Blimey, look where we are. 
JAMIE: Back at the temple. 
SEAN: There's somebody down there. 
POLLY: Boo. 
BEN: Ah, it's Polly! All right. 
JAMIE: Polly! 
JACKO: You know her? 
BEN: Yeah, of course I do. She's one of our lot. 
POLLY: What happened to you? 
BEN: We found a tunnel in the mines that lead into this idol. 
JAMIE: So here we are. 
BEN: What's this rigout in aid of? 
POLLY: They were going to turn me into a fish. 
BEN: Into a fish? 
POLLY: It's not funny! 
SEAN: I'm Sean, this is Jacko. 
JAMIE: Have you seen the Doctor? 
POLLY: Not since he went off with Professor Zaroff. Why, haven't you? 
BEN: No, but I'd love to know what he's up to.

[Council chamber]

DOCTOR: Ramo, this ruler of yours, is he 
RAMO: His name is Thous. He believes Zaroff to be the deliverer of Atlantis. 
(Thous enters.) 
THOUS: Good evening, Brothers of the Temple. Please be seated. What is this important business you want to tell me about? 
RAMO: Most excellent Thous, this is a matter of life and death. Under no other circumstances would I have brought a stranger to you in temple garb. 
THOUS: A stranger? Who are you? 
DOCTOR: A man of science. 
THOUS: Science? Ah, I see. One of Professor Zaroff's colleagues. Perhaps we should ask him to join us. 
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, I wouldn't do that if I were you. In fact, I wanted to speak to you alone, Excellency. 
(Ramo moves away.) 
THOUS: Well, speak. 
DOCTOR: Excellency, the Professor is a wonderful man. 
THOUS: Wonderful? 
DOCTOR: A worker of miracles. 
THOUS: Indeed, you speak the truth. 
DOCTOR: But, have you noticed his eyes lately? 
THOUS: No. 
DOCTOR: When he talks of his project, have you noticed his eyes? They light up like this! 
THOUS: What does this mean? 
DOCTOR: The Professor is as mad as a hatter. 
THOUS: Mad? Zaroff? 
DOCTOR: Completely. No answer. It's sad. 
THOUS: I do not understand. 
RAMO: We believe Zaroff to be working toward the destruction of Atlantis, not it's resurrection. 
THOUS: I have heard such words from you before, Ramo. 
RAMO: This man has proved it to me. Zaroff's plan will split the world in two. This is not the action of a sane man. 
THOUS: But your own priests proclaimed him to be the prophet who would raise us above the sea. 
RAMO: Lolem. He is old and superstitious. 
THOUS: And your superior, Ramo. Remember that! 
DOCTOR: So you will not listen to us? 
THOUS: I did not say that. I have heard your arguments. 
DOCTOR: We've only just begun. 
THOUS: I have heard enough. Now leave me, and I will consider what you have said. 
RAMO: I know you will choose well, for all our sakes.

[Temple of Amdo]

ARA: Oh, I'm sorry I'm so long. Here's some food. 
JAMIE: Ah, food. 
POLLY: And clothing. Super. Thanks, Ara. Look at this! Listen, why are you doing all this for us? 
ARA: You were kind to me, and I hate Zaroff. 
JAMIE: You hate Zaroff? 
ARA: We are not all his slaves. He will find out one day. 
SEAN: Let's hope we find out soon. Do you want all that food for yourself, Ben? Come on.
BEN: Oh, sorry. Look, Ara, have you seen anything of the Doctor? 
ARA: Yes, I'll take you to him later. 
BEN: What's that? 
ARA: Oh, quickly, you must hide. They're coming. 
JAMIE: Back where we came from, Ben. 
BEN: Right, the safest place in the whole of Atlantis. 
SEAN: There's no need to be afraid, girl. 
(Ara looks at the idol in fear.) 
POLLY: Aren't you coming with us, Ara? 
ARA: No, I must stay here. I'll be missed. 
JAMIE: Are you two going to remain here all night? Come on. 
(Ara slips away as the four go into the hidden chamber.)

[Council chamber]

(The Doctor and Ramo are summoned.) 
THOUS: I have given much thought to your words, and I have come to a decision. There is your answer. 
(The doors are thrown open to admit Zaroff and his guards.) 
THOUS: Do with them what you will!

Episode Three

(From the Lost in Time DVD)

[Thous' room]

ZAROFF: So you're just a little man after all, Doctor, like all the rest. You disappoint me. 
DOCTOR: You disappoint me, Professor. I didn't think a man of science needed the backing of thugs. 
ZAROFF: Have a care, Doctor. Your life is in the balance. 
DOCTOR: What, you mean you haven't told your own people what's in store for them? Are you afraid, Zaroff? 
ZAROFF: I have made a mistake. If I had not interfered with the temple sacrifice, the sharks would have torn you apart. But it's not too late. I'll return you to Lolem and tell him I need you no longer. And he can have that stupid priest as makeweight. 
DOCTOR: No. You've no quarrel with Ramo. I persuaded him to help me. I'm the one to blame. 
RAMO: That is not true. I have always distrusted you, Zaroff. 
ZAROFF: Take them away! 
RAMO: The curse of Amdo be on you! 
ZAROFF: Goodbye, Doctor. Have a pleasant journey. 
DOCTOR: Let's not say goodbye, Professor. We'll be seeing each other again. 
ZAROFF: Not in this world, Doctor. 
(The Doctor and Ramo are taken away.) 
ZAROFF: As always, there is nothing to worry about. 
THOUS: And there is no truth in this man's arguments? 
ZAROFF: The man is a fool. Have I not sworn to you that Atlantis shall rise again from the sea? Haven't I? Haven't I? What are you staring at? 
(Thous is looking into Zaroff's eyes.) 
THOUS: Nothing. Nothing at all.

[Temple of Amdo].

(The priests enter in their seaweed robes. The Doctor and Ramo are stood before two beheading blocks.) 
DOCTOR: What happens now? 
RAMO: First the supplication, and then 
(He looks at a masked man with a large sword.) 
LOLEM: Accept, oh powerful and mighty Amdo, these your sacrifices. 
DOCTOR: I'm sorry I got you into this, Ramo. 
RAMO: We all have to die sometime, Doctor. If it is the will of Amdo, it is inevitable. 
(Their necks are forced down onto the blocks. But just as the headsman raises his sword, a shrieking sound comes from the mouth of the idol. Everyone stops and stares.) 
VOICE: This is the voice of Amdo. Hear me. Bow down your heads that Amdo may accept your sacrifice. Bow. Let no human eyes witness this awful moment. 
(All but the Doctor kow tow.) 
DOCTOR: (sotto) I know that voice. 
(The secret door opens and Ben beckons to the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: (sotto) Ramo. Don't be afraid. Get up and follow me. Come on. 
(They run forward and duck behind the altar as Lolem looks up.) 
VOICE: He who looks on the living face of Amdo shall die. 
(The Doctor and Ramo get inside the secret door. The idol screams again.) 
LOLEM: A miracle! A great and powerful miracle! Amdo has eaten up her victims!

[Secret room]

RAMO: Unbelievable. All these years and I never guessed Amdo's secret. 
DOCTOR: Oh, I thought I recognised the voice. How on Earth did you manage it? 
POLLY: This is linked to the back of Amdo's mouth. It's a bit old but it works. 
DOCTOR: It was the sweetest sound I've ever heard in me life. 
POLLY: Thanks, Doctor. 
BEN: Keep your voices down now, or they'll hear us. 
POLLY: No, they won't, I've put the bunghole in. 
RAMO: So Amdo was made to trick her worshipers. 
DOCTOR: Ben, how did you find this place? 
BEN: Oh, we found it by chance. A tunnel in the mines leads straight here. 
DOCTOR: Jamie! 
JAMIE: Doctor. That's Sean, that's Jacko. 
(It turns out that Sean is blond and Jacko is dark-skinned.)

[Council chamber].

ZAROFF: So I tell you, it's complete. Everything will be ready in two days from now. 
THOUS: To think that after so long the great day is at hand. We shall surprise the whole of mankind. 
ZAROFF: Yes. A very great surprise. Perhaps the greatest ever. 
THOUS: I shall order special prayers today. 
ZAROFF: Why not? It will keep the people happy. 
LOLEM [OC]: Let me in! 
THOUS: What is the meaning of this, exalted Lolem? 
LOLEM: A miracle, mighty Thous, before our very eyes! 
ZAROFF: Tell us. 
LOLEM: Mighty Amdo, goddess of land and sea, has accepted the sacrifice of the priest, and the little Doctor. 
ZAROFF: Indeed. What a miracle. 
LOLEM: They vanished into air before they could be beheaded. 
ZAROFF: No. Disappeared, you say? How? 
LOLEM: They were in our midst and we bowed our heads in prayer. When we looked again they'd gone. 
ZAROFF: You lie, Priest. You allowed them to escape, no? 
THOUS: You discredit the mystic power of Amdo? 
ZAROFF: I believe what I see with my own eyes. 
THOUS: The truth, Lolem. 
RAMO: I tell you, the voice of Amdo spoke to us. 
ZAROFF: Ha. 
LOLEM: The little Doctor no longer lives. 
THOUS: You're certain? 
LOLEM: By the spirit of Amdo, by the all-beating heart of living Atlantis. 
THOUS: Perhaps he is right. It is a miracle. You may go. 
ZAROFF: Yes, go. And pray to Amdo that you are right. 
LOLEM: May the wrath of Amdo engulf you! 
ZAROFF: I'll take my chance. Get out! 
(Lolem leaves.) 
THOUS: Is it wise to sow seeds of doubt by discrediting a miracle just now? 
ZAROFF: Yes. If the Doctor is at large, he can be an even bigger danger. We must search the whole of Atlantis for him. 
THOUS: But Lolem has said 
ZAROFF: Maybe Lolem can raise Atlantis again from the sea with his prayers? 
THOUS: Give your orders, Zaroff. It shall be as you wish. 
ZAROFF: Now you are talking sense again.

[Secret room].

POLLY: The point is, where do we go from here? 
BEN: Yeah, where? 
JAMIE: Aye, tell us, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Our course is plain. We must attack Zaroff. He has gone mad, and he's bent on destroying the whole world. We've only a short while in which to stop him. 
SEAN: Well, just tell us what to do. 
DOCTOR: Food. 
SEAN: You're hungry, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Hmm? 
SEAN: Hungry? 
DOCTOR: No, I mean Zaroff and his people cannot exist without food. 
RAMO: But there's always plenty of food for everyone. The sea is all around us. The supplies are unlimited. 
DOCTOR: Yes, but who provides it? 
RAMO: The fish people do. 
DOCTOR: The fish people! Exactly. And why? Because they are slaves. But slaves, like worms, can be made to turn. 
POLLY: Right. So if you organise the fish people to cut off the supplies. Yes, but that's no good. Then they'll just go and live off their stocks. 
DOCTOR: Tell them, Ramo. 
RAMO: We have no stocks of food. 
DOCTOR: Exactly. Zaroff has not yet found the answer to his great problem. All his seafood goes bad in a few hours, and has to be thrown away. 
RAMO: That's true. 
DOCTOR: And so 
BEN: I get it, we get the fish people to go on strike. 
JACKO: Oh, you are dreaming, man. 
SEAN: Now hold on a minute, we could try right enough. 
POLLY: Yes, but what would that do for us? 
DOCTOR: What would it do for us? I don't know, really, but it's a start. Do you think you can do it? 
SEAN: Well, we'll have a go, Doctor, but it'll take a great gift of the gab to win over the fish people, you know? 
DOCTOR: But you are Irish. 
SEAN: Well, come on, laughing boy. Tell me, how can we contact you? 
DOCTOR: We make this place our headquarters. If nobody's here, just leave a message. 
POLLY: Good luck. 
JACKO: Oh, we'll need it. 
(Jacko and Sean leave.) 
BEN: What are we going to do? 
DOCTOR: Kidnap Professor Zaroff!

[Market]

(Polly and Ara look around the fish people's market. Polly is in local clothes now, a sea-shell bodice and seaweed skirt, and decorative headdress. The Doctor has a headscarf and cloak, and playing his recorder, rather like a gypsy.) 
DOCTOR: Are you all right? 
POLLY: Yes, super. Look what I've got on. 
DOCTOR: You look splendid. 
POLLY: Better than you do. Couldn't you find a better disguise than that? 
DOCTOR: What's wrong with it? 
POLLY: You look like a sailor. 
DOCTOR: That's what I'm supposed to be. 
(A fish woman comes past with a large basket.) 
POLLY: No, thank you. 
(Polly takes a drink from a fountain.) 
POLLY: Salt water. 
DOCTOR: What do you expect? This is Atlantis. Now you know what to do? 
POLLY: I think so. 
DOCTOR: Wait a minute. Something's gone wrong. Where's Zaroff? 
POLLY: Looking for us. 
(Guards come through the market. Ara conceals Polly as they try to avoid them.) 
ARA: Back this way. Nola, we need your help. 
NOLA: (a stall holder) Guards? 
POLLY: They're looking for me. 
NOLA: Lie down. 
(She covers Polly with a rug and Ara sits on her.) 
GUARD: Have you seen any strangers about, old woman? 
NOLA: Everyone's a stranger these days. Why don't they stay away and leave us in peace? 
GUARD: What have you got here? 
(Another guard goes to jab the rug with his trident. Nola grabs it.) 
NOLA: How shall I sell my carpets if you stick holes in them? 
(The guards leave.) 
NOLA: It's clear. 
ARA: Are you all right? 
POLLY: Yes. Thank you very much. 
NOLA: Don't waste time, girl. Get away while you're safe. 
(Polly and Ara leave. The Doctor rattles his tambourine and sits by the fountain. Jamie and Ben enter in wetsuits, like Zaroff's guards wear.) 
JAMIE: Zaroff's on his way, close behind us. 
BEN: Hey! Did you see anyone come through the market place? 
DOCTOR: A man? 
BEN: Yes. 
DOCTOR: About five foot nine? 
BEN: That's right. 
DOCTOR: Black coat, baggy trousers and a bow tie? 
BEN: Exactly. 
(A guard walks straight past.) 
DOCTOR: No. As a matter of fact I haven't. 
BEN: You fool. 
JAMIE: He's gone. We'd better get in position. 
BEN: Right. 
DOCTOR: Polly! 
(Ara takes the Doctor's place at the fountain.) 
ZAROFF: Where's that man who has been a moment ago? 
ARA: What man, sir? 
ZAROFF: Answer me, girl. 
ARA: I don't know. 
ZAROFF: Guard! Search over there. 
GUARD: Sir! 
ZAROFF: You two come with me. 
(Ben and Jamie give nazi salutes and follow Zaroff.) 
DOCTOR: Zaroff! 
ZAROFF: There he is! There he is! Stop that man! 
DOCTOR: Zaroff! 
(Mayhem as everyone runs around. The Doctor runs out with Zaroff, Ben and Jamie following him.)

[Passageway]

ZAROFF: That man, which way did he go? 
(Polly keeps her face down and points along the passageway. She joins in the train behind Jamie.)

[Temple of Amdo].

RAMO: Is all well? 
DOCTOR: Splendid. He's close behind me. I hope I haven't set too hot a pace for him. No. Here he comes. 
(Ramo kneels in front of the idol as the Doctor hides. Zaroff enters with Ben and Jamie.) 
ZAROFF: He must be here somewhere. Search the temple. 
BEN: Yeah. 
ZAROFF: Who has entered here, priest? Ah, the renegade priest himself. Guards, take him! 
(Zaroff pushes Ramo into the arms of Ben and Jamie. He finds the Doctor behind a pillar.) 
ZAROFF: Ah, Doctor, at last. 
(The Doctor blows powder into his face from a blowpipe. Ben and Jamie pounce.) 
BEN: Right, to the back with him. 
ZAROFF: Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! 
POLLY: Doctor, now that you've got him, what are you going to do with him? 
DOCTOR: You'll see. Come on. 
(They all go into the secret chamber behind the idol.)

[Cliffside]

(Fish people are relaxing on the rocks, looking like Galapagos iguanas.) 
JACKO: Go on, tell them. 
SEAN: Tell them what? I tell them nothing. They're not people like us, they're just a bunch of sardines. You heard me. Cold-blooded fishes. You haven't got a drop of good red blood in your body. 
(The fish people don't like that.) 
SEAN: A flatfish from Galway would have more guts in them than that bunch. 
(The fish people throw pebbles and shells.) 
SEAN: (laughs) You wouldn't hurt a little child. 
JACKO: What would they do? 
SEAN: I'll tell them. All right, all right, all right. Oh, calm down and listen. Listen, will you? Look, you supply all the food for Atlantis, right? It can't be stored, right? It goes rotten in a couple of hours. That's why Zaroff has you working like slaves night and day, right? Well, has it never occurred to your little fish brains to stop that supply of food? Feed yourselves but starve Atlantis, eh? What do you think would happen then? Well now is your chance. Will you do it, or will you stay fish slaves for the rest of your lives? You're men, aren't you? Well, start the blockade right now. 
JACKO: Do you reckon they will do it? 
SEAN: Who knows? We can only hope for the best. 
(The word is spread underwater.)

[Secret chamber]

ZAROFF: I have underrated you, Doctor. I hardly imagined you would have the nerve to kidnap Zaroff himself. 
BEN: What's so funny? 
JAMIE: Aye, what? 
POLLY: I don't see what you've got to laugh at. 
ZAROFF: Dear lady, if you wish to stop my plans, you are all too late. 
RAMO: Too late? 
ZAROFF: The process has started. My nuclear reactor is activated, and when the desired figure is reached, fission will take place, and none of all this will matter for any of us. 
DOCTOR: He's only bluffing. Nothing can start without him. 
ZAROFF: Ah, Doctor, how do you know that? 
DOCTOR: Simple. The great Zaroff would have to be there to set off the explosion. Miss your big moment? I think not. 
ZAROFF: You cannot hold me. My guards will 
RAMO: Will never find you. Not inside the temple you have defiled, Zaroff. 
ZAROFF: You are fools! Idiots! I am mightier than all of you. If I, if 
(Zaroff collapses.) 
POLLY: Doctor? 
JAMIE: It's a ruse. 
POLLY: What's the matter with him? 
DOCTOR: Some sort of attack. 
BEN: That stopped him. The project won't be able to go ahead now, will it? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. We'd better make sure. 
JAMIE: What would you do? 
DOCTOR: Get inside that laboratory. 
JAMIE: Then I'm coming with you. 
BEN: Yeah, me too. 
DOCTOR: No, somebody's got to stay here to look after Zaroff. 
POLLY: I, I'll stay. 
JAMIE: You can't bide here by yourself. 
RAMO: I'll stay with her. 
DOCTOR: Very well. Come on. Quick. 
POLLY: Take care. 
BEN: Yeah.

[Temple of Amdo]

BEN: Not another service? 
DOCTOR: This is likely to take some time. 
JAMIE: Could we not just slip out? 
DOCTOR: I don't think so. Better duck down here. 
(They hide behind the altar.)

[Secret chamber]

POLLY: It doesn't seem possible, does it? 
RAMO: What? 
POLLY: Well, look at him. He doesn't look very menacing now, does he? 
RAMO: There is still evil in this man. It hangs over him like a shroud. You will pay dearly for your crimes, Zaroff. 
ZAROFF: I know, I know. But before I die, priest, you must help me to pray to your god for atonement. 
RAMO: Why should I help you? 
ZAROFF: Have pity on me. At least help me stand at your side so I may feel the aura of your goodness. 
POLLY: I think you should. He does look very ill. 
RAMO: It's more than you deserve, Zaroff. But for the blessing of Amdo I will grant you this last request. 
(Ramo helps Zaroff up, and Zaroff starts strangling him. Ramo throws him off and grabs a sword. He jabs at Zaroff but Zaroff grabs it and presses it against Ramo's throat.) 
ZAROFF: And now, meddling priest, this is the end of you. 
(Zaroff throws Ramo down and makes to stab him in the back. Polly tries to intervene.) 
POLLY: Don't! Stop it! 
(Zaroff throws her off and kills Ramo. Polly screams.) 
ZAROFF: You will come with me. 
(He takes her into the tunnel.)

[Temple of Amdo]

(The Doctor, Ben and Jamie peer over the altar wearing fish masks. The celebrants are leaving.) 
BEN: Who'd have thought it would take that long. 
JAMIE: Let's get started. 
BEN: Yeah, quick. 
DOCTOR: Just a minute, I've had a thought. 
JAMIE: What? 
DOCTOR: Jamie, you'd better watch Zaroff. 
JAMIE: Why? 
DOCTOR: Well, we need a guide, and only Ramo knows all the passages. 
JAMIE: Oh, if you say so, Doctor. 
(Ramo staggers out of the secret chamber.) 
JAMIE: Doctor, look! 
RAMO: Zaroff. 
DOCTOR: Come on. Come on. 
(They help Ramo down the steps and lay him down while Jamie goes to check on Polly.) 
BEN: Is he? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
BEN: Zaroff was having us on. 
JAMIE: Polly's gone. 
DOCTOR: Zaroff's taken her as a hostage. 
BEN: Well, let's go! 
DOCTOR: No, Ben. Jamie, you go after Polly. Only watch out. Zaroff's a desperate man. 
JAMIE: Right. 
DOCTOR: Ben, you and I have other fish to fry. Come on.

[Tunnel]

(Zaroff is dragging Polly along by a rope tied around her wrists.) 
POLLY: Oh, wait. I can't go on any more. 
ZAROFF: You will go on if I have to drag you. Wait. Did you hear anything? 
POLLY: No, nothing. 
ZAROFF: Come on. 
POLLY: No. 
ZAROFF: Do you want the same treatment as the priest? 
POLLY: No. 
ZAROFF: Come. 
JAMIE: Polly? 
(Polly pulls the rope out of Zaroff's hands and runs to Jamie.) 
ZAROFF: Wait. Come back here. Come back, I warn you. 
(Round a corner Jamie starts to untie Polly.) 
ZAROFF: Ah! 
(The nimble Jamie avoids Zaroff's attacks. Polly hits him on the head with a rock and he turns so Jamie can jump on his back.) 
POLLY: Jamie! 
(Zaroff throws Jamie off. Sean and Jacko arrive. Sean yells.) 
ZAROFF: Go back. Go back. 
(Zaroff grabs Polly then throws her into Jamie's arms as he runs off, laughing.) 
JAMIE: He's away. 
POLLY: Jamie, quickly, we've got to go and warn the Doctor. 
JAMIE: Aye, the Doctor's going to find a heap of trouble if Zaroff gets back there first. 
JACKO: How do we find the laboratory? 
POLLY: Ara, she's the only one we know who knows the way. Now you go back to the temple and we'll go and find her.

[Council chamber]

DAMON: The slaves are in revolt. They've cut off all food supplies. 
THOUS: I cannot understand it. Why do they act like this when the hour of triumph is at hand? 
DAMON: They're just slaves, what can you expect? 
THOUS: Where is Zaroff? He should be here to attend to this. 
DAMON: Disappeared. 
THOUS: Disappeared? He can't have. Go and look for him. 
DAMON: There is no time, Excellency. You must take control now. 
THOUS: So be it. I cannot let my people starve. Bring them before me that I may hear their demands. 
DAMON: Yes, great Thous, I will tell them. 
(Damon leaves.) 
THOUS: All-wise, all-seeing Amdo, help me now. 
(Zaroff enters with two of his guards.) 
THOUS: Zaroff! Where have you been? We've been looking for you. The workers are in revolt. 
ZAROFF: My guards will restore order. 
THOUS: They are simple people. I'm sure they will 
ZAROFF: Those who resist will be killed. 
THOUS: Killed? 
ZAROFF: I have no time to waste. 
THOUS: Zaroff, you are subject to me in all matters. I will not have my people 
ZAROFF: Your people? Your people? They are my people now. I hold their whole world in my power. 
THOUS: The Doctor was right about you. I order your project stopped at this moment. Guards! Take Zaroff to the temple and hold him there. 
(Zaroff signals his own guards to stop the Atlanteans.) 
ZAROFF: You're a fool. You're a fool! I'll send you to your beloved goddess Amdo to discuss the future of the universe with her. 
THOUS: I demand that you 
ZAROFF: You? You demand? You demand? Well since your, since your beloved goddess has developed such an enchanting appetite for people, it is only fitting that the great Thous should offer himself. No, no, I shall offer him. 
(Zaroff takes a pistol from under his cloak and shoots Thous.) 
ZAROFF: Kill those two men. Nothing in the world can stop me now!

Episode Four

[Council chamber]

(A little later, Ben and the Doctor enter.) 
BEN: Doctor, look at this! Someone's been having a right punch-up in here. 
DOCTOR: It's the governor. It's Thous. 
BEN: Is he all right? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. Doesn't seem to have hit anything vital. 
BEN: Doesn't look too good, though. 
DOCTOR: Neither would you with a bullet in you. 
BEN: If we don't stop Zaroff soon, we'll all be for the chop. 
DOCTOR: I know. Come on, we must get him to safety. 
BEN: Well, then what? 
DOCTOR: To the generating station.

[Secret chamber]

JACKO: Are you sure the Doctor said we are to meet here? 
ARA: He must come back soon. 
SEAN: Well, if he's not back in five minutes we move on, okay? 
JACKO: Oh, where to, if the whole world is going to blow up in a couple of hours? 
SEAN: You're a great comfort to have around, did anyone ever tell you that? 
ARA: Look out. 
DOCTOR: Here we are. Careful. Anyone at home? 
ARA: Oh, Doctor! Oh, what's wrong? 
BEN: He's wounded, but don't worry, Ara, he'll be all right. 
DOCTOR: Where's Polly and Jamie? 
ARA: They've gone to Zaroff's laboratory. 
DOCTOR: Why? 
ARA: To look for you. I showed them which way to go and then they told me to come back here and wait. 
DOCTOR: We'll have to find them. Now, listen everyone. I have a plan. 
SEAN: Good. 
DOCTOR: It might even work. 
SEAN: Well? 
DOCTOR: Our one hope of stopping Zaroff is to flood all this lower part of Atlantis. 
BEN: But that means in here. 
DOCTOR: Yes. The temple, and Zaroff's laboratory. 
SEAN: Yes, but will the water stop there? 
DOCTOR: Don't know. We'll have to take that chance. 
JACKO: Yeah, but the people here. 
DOCTOR: They'll have to be warned and moved to a higher level. That's your job and Sean's. 
SEAN: And you? 
DOCTOR: Ben and I will try and get into the generating station. We'll turn up the power on the reactor, break down the sea walls and flood the laboratory. There's only one thing that's worrying me. 
SEAN: What's that? 
DOCTOR: Can we all swim?

[Zaroff's laboratory]

MAN [OC]: Stabiliser station Z2 calling. Stabiliser station Z2 calling. Routine check. 
TECH: Control receiving. 
MAN [OC]: Stabilisers normal. Nothing to report. 
TECH: Thank you, station Z-2, report again at zero minus five. 
MAN [OC]: Will do. 
TECH: That's in another ten minutes. 
MAN 2 [OC]: Priority, priority. Reactor station Z3 calling. Reactor station Z3 calling. 
ZAROFF: Zaroff here. 
MAN 2 [OC]: Reading maximum. Gauges four, five and six steady. Gauge three fluctuating and unpredictable. 
ZAROFF: Bring in the reserve. 
MAN 2 [OC]: The reserve? But if that fails. 
ZAROFF: That is an order! Report back if the fault continues. 
MAN2 [OC]: Yes, Professor. 
ZAROFF: Nothing can go wrong now. Nothing must go wrong. 
MAN 3 [OC]: Emergency, power network control. 
ZAROFF: Zaroff here, what's the problem? 
MAN 3 [OC]: Station eleven is no longer operating, the workers have deserted. 
ZAROFF: Deserted? What's the matter with them? Where are they? 
MAN 3 [OC]: They're out looking for food. 
ZAROFF: Why? 
MAN 3 [OC]: The food supplies have not arrived and there's a rumour that we're facing starvation. They've all panicked. 
ZAROFF: And no reserves? 
MAN 3 [OC]: That's right. 
ZAROFF: Get them back at once. Send the guards after them. 
MAN 3 [OC]: I've had to bring the guards into the plant to prevent a complete breakdown. 
ZAROFF: Well, do the best you can. I get more men to you within the hour. Blast! Blast! Blast!

[Outside the generating station]

(There's an armed guard on duty. The Doctor and Ben stay out of sight.) 
BEN: A guard! How are we going to get past him? 
DOCTOR: We'll walk past him. 
BEN: What, in those trousers? 
DOCTOR: Oh, you think I look a bit conspicuous, do you? 
BEN: A bit, yeah. 
DOCTOR: Maybe you're right. I know. You're a guard, and I'm a prisoner, right? 
BEN: Right! 
DOCTOR: Now don't make a mess of it, there's a good chap. 
GUARD: Halt! 
BEN: Prisoner and escort for Professor Zaroff. 
GUARD: Password? 
BEN: Ay? 
GUARD: Password? 
BEN: Yeah, well, look it's all right for you giving me the old chat, mate, but I know nothing about passwords. I've been out chasing this burke all day. 
GUARD: Professor Zaroff's not here anyway. 
BEN: Well, I know that. My orders was to bring him here and wait. 
GUARD: That's all very well. How do I know he's a wanted man? 
BEN: Well, blimey, look at him. He ain't normal, is he? 
GUARD: Yes, I see what you mean. All right. 
(The guard lets them through.) 
DOCTOR: You don't know the password either! 
GUARD: It's Oscar. Get him out of here! 
BEN: Go on, get out! Thanks, mate. 
DOCTOR: Very well done, Ben, very well done. I'm not quite sure about that not being normal bit, but very well done. I couldn't have done better myself. 
BEN: Thanks. 
GUARD 2: Halt. Give the password. 
BEN: Oscar. 
GUARD: Pass, Oscar. 
DOCTOR: Come on, now. We've got little time.

[Power station]

(Ben sneaks up behind the lone engineer and knocks him out.) 
BEN: What now? 
DOCTOR: Cut those cables. 
(Ben gets to work. There is a huge flywheel in the middle of the room driving the main generator. It begins to falter and slow. The Doctor adjusts some control levers.) 
BEN: Do you know what you're doing? 
DOCTOR: Oh, what a question. Of course I don't! There's no rule against trying, is there? There. Now, Zaroff's laboratory. He should be feeling the effects of this little lot any time now.

[Tunnel]

JAMIE: There's a gap through here. 
POLLY: Oh, Jamie, I think we're lost. Are you sure this is the way Ara told us to come? 
JAMIE: Aye. All the tunnels look alike, though. 
POLLY: No, listen. We must be somewhere below Zaroff's power source. 
JAMIE: Aye, it's like the beating of the Devil's heart. 
POLLY: You're not far wrong. We'd better keep going. The laboratory can't be far away. 
JAMIE: Aye, but which way?

[Zaroff's laboratory]

ZAROFF: That reading must be wrong, you idiot. I'll check it myself. No, that's not possible. Come here. Look at that reading. That's all we need now, radiation leak. Where the Devil is it coming from?

[Tunnel ledge]

JAMIE: I told you, don't look down. 
POLLY: But Jamie, look. The wall down there. It's glowing. 
JAMIE: What is it? 
POLLY: It could be radiation. 
JAMIE: Well, what's that then? 
POLLY: Radiation? Well, it's. Oh, it's too difficult to explain. The walls are beginning to crumble. It's all that vibration. 
JAMIE: Let's see, the sea's on the other side of that wall. Now if that gives way. 
POLLY: Yes. 
JAMIE: There must be way up to higher ground. 
(The wall starts to crack and sea water begins to come in. Jamie and Polly get to the end of the ledge and run up the next tunnel.) 
POLLY: Must get breath. 
JAMIE: Lucky it's uphill. Take more time for the water to reach us. 
POLLY: What's that? 
JAMIE: It's given way. The sea's breaking through!

[Another tunnel]

(Sean and Jacko are carrying Thous on a stretcher, with Ara following.) 
SEAN: Will you listen to that. 
JACKO: What is it? 
SEAN: How would I know, but it certainly isn't closing time at Betty Murphy's pub. It can be only one thing. It's the Doctor, of course. He's started to flood Atlantis. The sea's breaking in. 
THOUS: To raise Atlantis from the sea was only the dream of a madman after all. 
ARA: Rest. Don't speak. 
JACKO: Aye, rest. 
SEAN: And you best forget about all that now and look to the future. That is, if we're going to have any future. 
(The lower levels of the city are flooding. The torrent breaks the idol in the temple.) 
SEAN: Well, personally speaking, not being a terribly good swimmer myself, I think I'll just start to make a move. 
JACKO: Ah, we've got a visitor. 
SEAN: Oh Damon, you got my warning then. 
DAMON: My operating room. A life's work, washed away. 
THOUS: Damon. 
DAMON: Thous. 
THOUS: We can start again, Damon. 
SEAN: Look, if we don't hurry and get onto high ground above water level, we're going to be turned into fish food. 
DAMON: Yes, you're right. Quite so. I'll help. We've got a long way to go yet. 
SEAN: Come on, Jacko, up. Gently now. That's it.

[Tunnel].

POLLY: Oh, no! It's a dead end. 
JAMIE: Aye. 
POLLY: Jamie, we must go back. We've got to warn the others. There must be another turning. 
JAMIE: No, I kept an eye open for one on the way up. Besides, would you listen to that water. 
POLLY: We've got to get out of here somehow. 
(Jamie raises his candle to look, and the flame gutters.) 
JAMIE: Do you see that? There's a draught. Right, that's what we'll follow. I'll go first, and you stay close behind me.

[Mountain cave]

(Damon sets up a first aid station, high above the city. Refugees are huddling here.) 
DAMON: Artificial respiration. Your wound? 
THOUS: A little better. How is my poor country? 
DAMON: The water has already flooded the lower parts of the city. 
THOUS: The great enemy, which we held at bay for so many centuries, the ever-lasting nightmare is here at last. 
DAMON: Rescue parties are being organised. All passages have been blocked except the main shaft. We're keeping that open till the last to give the stragglers a chance. 
THOUS: What of Lolem the priest? 
DAMON: Well, last seen he was going towards the temple to seek aid from Amdo. 
THOUS: He is lost then. 
SEAN: We may still find them. Are you all right there? 
DAMON: You look after yourself. 
SEAN: Oh, hey Jacko? Any luck? 
JACKO: What do you expect? They must have all been drowned. 
SEAN: Ah, well. Probably a better death than the one that's in store for us when Zaroff lets off his explosion.

[Zaroff's laboratory]

ZAROFF: No one, I repeat, no one will leave his place. Everything goes according to schedule, except that the time of the big detonation has been advanced. The whole project will be activated from this control point. That is all until zero minus five. 
(The Doctor and Ben enter.) 
ZAROFF: Now we must connect you. 
DOCTOR: Good day to you. I hope I'm not too late. 
ZAROFF: There is the man who has been trying to sabotage all our plans. Make sure he doesn't leave us now. 
DOCTOR: Oh, how very nice of you, but I'm afraid I've interrupted something important, haven't I? Oh, yes, I can see that I have. You were on the point of exploding your firecracker, weren't you? 
(Zaroff laughs.) 
DOCTOR: I hope you've let these gentlemen into your big secret. 
ZAROFF: They share everything with me. 
DOCTOR: Naturally. They can't help themselves, can they? They must be devoted to you, to allow you to blow them all to pieces! 
TECH: You what? What's he talking about, Professor? 
DOCTOR: Oh, have I dropped a brick? Oh, I seem to have shaken some of them. Zaroff, I think you ought to know the sea has broken through and is about to overwhelm us here. 
ZAROFF: Don't listen to him. The man lies. 
DOCTOR: Then perhaps the distant roaring that we can hear is just the goddess Amdo with the indigestion? 
TECH: He's right. Come on! 
ZAROFF: Don't be alarmed. Don't be fooled. Ah, they're cowards, traitors. But it doesn't matter. 
DOCTOR: Time is running out, Zaroff. Hadn't you better call it a day? 
ZAROFF: You cannot beat me, Doctor. 
(Zaroff turns a control and a portcullis descends cutting him and his control panel off from the rest of the room.) 
ZAROFF: You see, I have anticipated every situation. There was always a possibility that someone would try to keep me from my ultimate moment of triumph. Now no one can get through this, and all the controls are on this side. Now all I must do is press the plunger when the needle of that dial is over the thousand mark. Simple, no? I tell you, so that you may share the last, great experiment of Zaroff! 
BEN: He's off his rocker. 
DOCTOR: I know. I've got to get him out of there. Come over here. I've got an idea. 
ZAROFF: Don't go away, Doctor. You will die just the same. You might as well stay and watch me.

[Tunnel].

(Jamie has climbed up the rock face to find the source of the breeze.) 
JAMIE: Hold the candle. Oh, would you be careful? 
POLLY: Sorry, I didn't do it on purpose. 
JAMIE: Right. 
POLLY: Any luck? 
JAMIE: Aye, there's a wee hole down there. I can't see where it leads to though. But if you're willing to take a chance? 
POLLY: Do we have a choice? 
(He pulls her up and they crawl on.) 
POLLY: Only just in time. 
JAMIE: Aye, we're not out of the woods yet.

[Zaroff's laboratory]

BEN: Doctor, I've got to go. The water's nearly here. 
ZAROFF: I see you have your deserters, too, Doctor. That leaves just you and me. 
DOCTOR: All right, Ben. 
BEN: Goodbye. 
ZAROFF: Young fool. I will press the plunger long before the water gets here. The result will be the same. 
DOCTOR: I know. But it's much more exciting in the dark. 
(The Doctor pulls out the lighting cables.) 
ZAROFF: Doctor, you are a comedian. 
(Zaroff draws his pistol and raises the portcullis. The lights come back on again.) 
ZAROFF: You see. Keep very still, Doctor. We have an emergency system here. You have solved nothing. Now unfortunately I have to tie you up. Turn around. 
(Ben has returned, and he lowers the portcullis, rolling underneath it as it falls. Zaroff is cut off from the control panel.) 
ZAROFF: No! No! You cannot do this to me! 
(Zaroff fires his pistol wildly as the Doctor and Ben get away.) 
ZAROFF: No! No! No! 
(Zaroff tries to reach through the portcullis to the controls, but the plunger is just out of reach.)

[Tunnel]

BEN: Doctor, hurry. Now what's the matter? 
DOCTOR: Ben, I've been thinking. I can't leave Zaroff to drown down there. I'm going back for him. 
BEN: But why on Earth? We've got to get out of here quick or we'll be cut off! 
DOCTOR: But we can't leave him there. 
BEN: Look, you're coming with me.

[Tunnel cave]

POLLY: Oh, it's no use, Jamie, I'll never make it. 
JAMIE: Course you can. One wee slope and we're away. 
POLLY: And another and another and another. It's no use, I won't, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Come on. 
POLLY: No, no, I can't, Jamie, I can't. I can't. I can't. 
JAMIE: Polly! Polly! Come on. I'll help you.

[Tunnel]

(The water is still coming in.) 
DOCTOR: Zaroff. He's cut off. 
BEN: Zaroff? Who cares about him? That means the others must be, too. Well, are they? 
DOCTOR: Well, how do I know? All we can do is to go on going up. Come on. 
(In his lab, Zaroff is waist deep in water and still trying to reach the plunger. On a steep incline, Ben slips.) 
DOCTOR: Nearly there. Of course, if you will lie down and sleep. 
BEN: Who said anything about lying down?

[Cave]

(Just above the shoreline.) 
JAMIE: Come on. Come on. Fresh air. 
POLLY: Oh, we made it. Ben and the Doctor? 
JAMIE: I'm thinking he wouldn't have stood much of a chance back there. They may have. 
(Jamie leaves Polly to cry and goes off towards the beach. After a few moments she takes off her headdress and follows. In the lab, the rising water cuts out the power, but Zaroff keeps straining for the plunger even as it closes over his head.)

[Mountain cave]

DAMON: Any sign of the Doctor? 
ARA: No. He must have died saving us. 
THOUS: We'll raise a stone to him in the temple. 
DAMON: No. No more temples. It was temples and priests and superstition that made us follow Zaroff in the first place. When the water's found it's own level, the temple will be buried forever. We shall never return to it. But we will have enough left to build a new Atlantis, without gods and without fish people. 
THOUS: Yes. That shall be his memorial.

[Tunnel]

(Finally, daylight ahead.) 
BEN: Doctor, what about Polly?

[Mountainside]

(Jamie and Polly are sitting by a rock.) 
POLLY: I can't see anyone. 
(There is a noise behind them.) 
JAMIE: Whist. 
(Jamie draws his dirk and circles around.) 
DOCTOR: Boo! 
JAMIE: You! 
DOCTOR: Me? 
JAMIE: We thought you were dead. 
DOCTOR: Us? Polly, good to see you. Come on, you two. 
(They head down to the Tardis. Sean and Jacko arrive to see them go inside it.) 
SEAN: Oh, no. I can't believe it. 
JACKO: What? 
SEAN: A flaming English police box. 
(The Tardis dematerialises.)

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Right. Off we go into the wide blue yonder, as someone was once heard to remark. 
POLLY: Hooray. 
BEN: Yeah, I'm not sorry to be out of that place. Phwoar, Jamie, you don't half stink of fish! 
JAMIE: Oh, you want to take a wee sniff of yourself, Benjamin. He's not exactly a bonnie bunch of heather. 
DOCTOR: You sound very happy, Jamie. 
JAMIE: Oh aye, Doctor, I am now. You know I never thought I'd say this, but, well it's great. 
POLLY: What is? 
JAMIE: All this. I'll never know what makes it go, mind you, but, well, at least I feel safe in here. It's only the wee things outside that are, well, alarming. 
DOCTOR: He's got a point there. 
BEN: Yeah, you can say that again. 
JAMIE: Is it a fact, though, Doctor? You can't exactly control the Tardis? 
DOCTOR: Control it? Of course I can control it. 
JAMIE: No, no, what I meant was, can you not exactly make it go where you mean it to? 
DOCTOR: If I wanted to. It's just that I've never wanted to. 
(General sounds of disbelief.) 
BEN: Oh, yeah, I bet. 
DOCTOR: Right, just for that, I'll show you. Now, where shall we go? I know, let's go to Mars. 
(The Tardis suddenly lurches.) 
POLLY: Doctor, what's happening? 
BEN: Doctor, can't you do something? 
DOCTOR: Do something? I seem to have done something. It's all your fault, wanting me to tamper with the steering. I'm very sorry, everybody, but I'm afraid the Tardis is out of control! 
(Polly screams.)

[Tardis]

(The Tardis is going haywire.) 
JAMIE: What's he done? 
BEN: Doctor, do something! 
DOCTOR: I'm trying to! 
JAMIE: We're not going to make it. 
(Everyone is being thrown across the room and back as the Doctor fights the controls. Soon everything settles down.) 
DOCTOR: I have it back in control again. 
BEN: Here, we're landing. Look. Coming at a fair rate. 
JAMIE: Oh, thank the Lord for that. You know, Doctor, I'll never ask you to do that again. 
DOCTOR: Huh? Oh, no. There must have been a reason for that. 
POLLY: Anyway, Doctor, you've done it. It's Mars. It must be. You're landing the Tardis exactly where you said you would. 
(The Tardis materialises amongst magnificent desolation.) 
BEN: Hey, wait a mo! This don't look like Mars to me. 
POLLY: How would you know? You never seen it. 
BEN: No, Duchess, but I have seen pictures of the moon's surface and that's what this looks like. 
JAMIE: That's the moon? 
POLLY: Doctor, is it the moon? 
(The Doctor nods.) 
BEN: Oh, well, you weren't too far out, were you? Only about two hundred million miles. 
DOCTOR: All right, let's move on. While we can. 
POLLY: Now wait a minute! 
BEN: What? 
POLLY: You don't expect to land us on the moon and let us fly off just like that, do you? 
BEN: Yeah, at least let us have a look around! 
JAMIE: That picture canna be the moon. The moon's way up in the sky. 
DOCTOR: Where do you think you're going? 
BEN: You're not going to tell us there's no shore leave. 
POLLY: Ah, please, Doctor. The Tardis isn't out of control or anything is it? 
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. It was just a bumpy landing, that's all. 
BEN: Yeah? 
DOCTOR: Well, if you must go ashore, only half an hour. 
BEN: Right. 
POLLY: Super. 
DOCTOR: You can't go ashore like that! You need space suits. There's no atmosphere out there. Come on, there's some in the chest. 
(Jamie is still staring at the scanner.) 
JAMIE: We'll maybe meet the old man in the moon. 
BEN: You won't meet nobody mate if you don't get some gear on. 
JAMIE: What? Oh aye.

[Lunar surface]

(Some time later, all four of them are suited up and they leave the Tardis to look around.) 
DOCTOR: Come on now, let's go over here. 
POLLY: Hey, look at this. 
DOCTOR: It's deserted. 
JAMIE: I don't think I like it. 
(Polly sees a pulsating light.) 
POLLY: Look, over there. 
JAMIE: I'll don't see anything. 
BEN: What did you see? 
POLLY: Some sort of great glow in the sky. 
BEN: It's probably your eyes getting used to the lunar light, hey, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Possibly. 
POLLY: What do we need these great clogs for? 
DOCTOR: Try a little jump. 
POLLY: All right. 
(Polly takes a small jump and rises about ten feet, falling slowly and rolling gently as she lands. Ben and Jamie copy her and collide.) 
DOCTOR: Careful! One tear in that space suit and you'll suffocate. 
POLLY: You never told me you'd taken ballet lessons, Ben. 
(Polly takes a big jump to a the crater rim.) 
POLLY: Come on, it's easy. 
BEN: Look out, here I come. 
(Jamie jumps too far and goes over the rim and out of sight.) 
POLLY: Where's he gone? 
BEN: Over there. 
(From the rim of the crater they look down on a large domed building.) 
POLLY: What on Earth? Look! 
BEN: Blimey! What is it? 
POLLY: Doctor, what is it? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. 
POLLY: Hey, I can see Jamie. There he is. 
(Jamie is lying unconscious by the dome.) 
BEN: Hey, there's somebody coming out. 
DOCTOR: Come on, let's go. 
(Two spacesuited figures come out of the dome's airlock and take Jamie inside. The Doctor, Ben and Polly hurry to the dome and Ben knocks on the airlock. Then it slides open. After a brief pause, they all go in.)

[Control room]

(The moonbase is a weather control centre. A small team of scientists govern weather patterns on Earth using a powerful device called the Gravitron. A map of the Earth dominates one wall, and the Gravitron probe is in a transparent dome on one side of the room with it's power controls in an insulated room. Each person wears a numbered uniform, and the gravitron technicians wear protective headgear. They are monitoring a Pacific hurricane or typhoon when one of the workers collapses. An alarm sounds.) 
BENOIT: (2nd in command, French) What on Earth is it? 
(Played by Andre Maranne, possibly the only genuine French actor the BBC knew.) 
(A web of black lines covers the stricken man's face.) 
HOBSON: (base commander) I don't know. Get him along to the Medical unit. 
BENOIT: But Doctor Evans has gone down with it as well. 
HOBSON: Yes, I know that but the relief Doctor from Earth should be here on the next shuttle rocket. 
BENOIT: Yes, yes, of course. Bob, give me a hand, will you? 
BOB: Yes, right. 
(Benoit and Bob carry the man out.) 
HOBSON: And Jules, you take over. Come on, it won't bite you. There must be some source to this infection. Look, we'd better get the lads in here and tell them what's happening. Get them on the blower, would you, Nils? 
NILS: (the number 3, Danish) Okay, Hobby. (into intercom) Nils speaking. We, er, we've got a bit of a flap on up here. 
(Hobson is distracted by the arrival of the Doctor, Polly and Ben next door.)

[Reception room]

NILS [OC]: Mister Hobson wants a word with you all in weather control room. Quick as you can. 
HOBSON: Hello. Where did you lot spring from? Don't tell me the shuttle rocket's arrived already? 
DOCTOR: No, it hasn't. 
SAM: There was another one with them, sir. Bob's taken him along to the Medical unit. He's all right. He's just knocked himself out or something. 
HOBSON: Oh no, if we haven't got enough troubles already. Have they been through the sterile room? 
SAM: Yes, Hobby. 
DOCTOR: We don't want to cause you any trouble. Just let us collect our young friend and we'll be off. 
HOBSON: Hey, not so fast. 
POLLY: Please, let me go and see Jamie. 
BENOIT: I will take you there, mademoiselle, if you come with me. 
HOBSON: All right, young lady. You can carry on. 
BENOIT: This way. 
(Polly and Benoit leave.) 
HOBSON: But I'd just like to have a word with you two. You could do with a extra bacteria check by the look of it. 
DOCTOR: Bacteria check? 
HOBSON: That's what I said. 
BEN: Well, thanks. 
DOCTOR: I'll have you know our Tardis is as sterile as 
HOBSON: Tardis? 
DOCTOR: Our space craft. 
NILS: They're all here, sir. Any time you're ready. 
HOBSON: Right. Well, we'll learn about your spacecraft a little later. Meanwhile, you'd better come along with me, meet my team and listen to what I have to say. 
DOCTOR: Thank you very much.

[Control room]

HOBSON: Well, you know what this place is? 
DOCTOR: Well, it looks like some sort of weather control centre? Ah, yes. And that's the thing with which you control the weather. That's the culprit, then. 
BEN: Ay? 
DOCTOR: That's what gave us such a bumpy landing. Some sort of gravity device? 
HOBSON: Some sort of gravity device. You are from Earth, aren't you? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
HOBSON: Well, where've you been for the past 20 years. Every school kid knows about the Gravitron in there. 
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. It must be about the year 2050, Ben. 
HOBSON: We've got a proper Rip Van Winkle here. It's 2070, in case you'd like to know. 
DOCTOR: There you are. I was only twenty years out. 
HOBSON: Well, before we all forget what century we're in, I'd better tell you why I've called you here. 
DOCTOR: Won't you introduce us first? I am a Doctor. 
HOBSON: A Doctor? You're arrived just in time. We need your help. 
DOCTOR: Ah. Do you? 
HOBSON: I'll see you in a moment. Now, this virus 
DOCTOR: Well, I may be able to help you if you'll introduce us. 
HOBSON: Right, Doctor. You'd better meet them all. We're all scientists here, you see. No room for idle hands, I see to that. Roger Benoit, beside you there, is my assistant. He takes over as Chief Scientist if anything happens to me. He's a physicist like me and Joe Benson there. Nils, our mad Dane, is an astronomer and mathematician as is Charlie here. Ralph, Jules and Franz are geologists. When they're not acting as cooks, looks-outs, general and, you know, handymen. 
DOCTOR: And this is where you control the Earth's weather? I see. 
BENOIT: The gravitron there controls the tides, the tides controls the weather. And from this console here we plot it all on that map. Simple, eh? 
BEN: Oh, yeah, very simple. Wish we'd had all this back in 1966. 
DOCTOR: Was it a bad year then? 
(An alarm sounds.) 
BEN: What's that? What's happened? 
(A man has collapsed inside the gravitron chamber.) 
HOBSON: It's Jim. Quick, Franz, take over here. 
(Franz puts on a helmet and goes into the chamber. Ralph and John carry Jim to the medical unit.) 
BENOIT: Indicator Five over the Pacific is starting to move. 
BEN: What does that mean? 
DOCTOR: Some form of change in the weather. 
HOBSON: We're soon hear from Earth what it means. 
NILS: Here it comes! 
CONTROL [OC]: International Space Control Headquarters Earth calling Weather Control Moon. Come in please. 
NILS: Moonport standing by. 
CONTROL [OC]: Earth calling Weather Control Moon. Come in please. 
NILS: Moonport standing by. 
HOBSON: Hobson here. 
CONTROL [OC]: What's happening up there? The hurricane you were guiding is now 45 degrees off course. It's threatening Hawaii. 
HOBSON: One of my men was taken ill. We're operational again now. 
CONTROL [OC]: The controller would like to know the cause of the illness. 
HOBSON: Yes, so would we. We've now got three men down with this mystery virus in the past few hours, including the doctor. 
CONTROL [OC]: One moment please. Stand by for further instructions. 
HOBSON: Just hang on another couple of minutes, lads. We'd better hear what the great Mister Rinberg has to say. 
NILS: Hobby? 
HOBSON: Yes. 
NILS: There it is again. I'll play it back to you. 
HOBSON [OC]: Yes, so would we. We've now got three men down with this mystery virus in the past few hours, including the Doctor. 
CONTROL [OC]: One moment please. Stand by for further instructions. 
NILS: Hear the big noise ratio on that re-run? We're being monitored again. 
HOBSON: Monitored? 
NILS: Someone, not too far away from the base, is listening to every word we say. 
CONTROL [OC]: Moonbase, Moonbase. Come in, Moonbase. 
HOBSON: Still standing by.

[Spacecraft]

(An alien spacecraft is concealed a short way from the dome, monitoring the conversation.) 
HOBSON [OC]: Well? 
CONTROL [OC]: Your instructions are to send blood samples back to Earth for investigation. 
HOBSON [OC]: Well, when can we do that? The next shuttle rocket's not for another month. 
CONTROL [OC]: Then they must be put on that rocket. In the meantime the Moonbase is to be put in quarantine.

[Control room]

HOBSON: Quarantine? What if these men aren't fit enough to get back to work. I shall need replacements. 
CONTROL [OC]: If you radio information about this virus, we'll do our best to identify it and suggest treatment. 
HOBSON: I demand to speak to Rinberg.

[Space ship]

CONTROL [OC]: The controller is busy. I'm sorry. Over and out.

[Control room]

NILS: That whole conversion was monitored by someone or something. 
HOBSON: Oh, never mind about that now. That Rinberg fellow just won't talk to you. How can we trace down this mystery illness with the doctor himself down with it. 
DOCTOR: We'd better get out of these things and see how Jamie is. Perhaps I could be of help in the sick bay now. 
HOBSON: Anything you can do. Bob! 
BOB: Yes, Mister Hobson? 
HOBSON: Show him to the Medical unit, will you? 
BOB: Yes, of course, sir. Will you come this way, please. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Thank you. 
(Bob, Ben and the Doctor leave.) 
HOBSON: Well, you all heard the position. We don't know what this infection is or how it got into the base, but I want you all to take extra precautions while this emergency is on. We may be short-handed for quite a while.

[Sickbay]

(Polly is attaching a medical monitor to Jamie's chest.) 
POLLY: Is this how it goes, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. Then this unit automatically controls the pulse, the temperature and the breathing. 
POLLY: A sort of electronic doctor. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Almost got striped trousers. 
BEN: And it even gives him medicines too? 
DOCTOR: Yes, it will do very nearly everything. 
POLLY: It can't be nice to him. Oh dear. How do you think he is, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Oh, he's not too bad. He's a bit concussed and feverish, but he'll be all right with rest. 
JAMIE: The Piper. The McCrimmon Piper. Don't let him get me! 
DOCTOR: Piper? 
POLLY: Some legend of his clan. As far as I can make out, this piper appears to a McCrimmon just before he dies. 
DOCTOR: Has this phantom piper appeared to Jamie yet? 
POLLY: You don't believe it, do you? 
DOCTOR: No, but he does. It's important to him. 
POLLY: He keeps asking us to keep the piper away from him. 
DOCTOR: Good. Well, we'll see whether we can do just that. 
BEN: Well, carry on, nurse. 
POLLY: Well, at least I tried to help. With a ward full of sick men and no doctor, somebody's got to do something. 
(A patient is groaning.) 
POLLY: I wonder who this is? 
DOCTOR: Don't get too near, Polly. Have a look on his chart. 
POLLY: Yes, that's a good idea. 
BEN: It's Doctor Evans. 
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. The station doctor. He was the first one to get it. 
POLLY: He looks one of the worst. 
DOCTOR: There's something about this epidemic that I don't quite understand. It's not like a real disease at all. It's almost as if 
BEN: Not real? What more do you want? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. But there are certain signs and symptoms which don't add up. Ben, I want you to go along to the control room and keep an eye on things. 
BEN: Well, how? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. Give a hand, do anything, but keep your eyes and ears open. 
BEN: Right. 
DOCTOR: There's something very wrong here. Very wrong indeed.

[Control room]

(The base is on it's night cycle. Benoit returns from a break.) 
BENOIT: Still up, Hobby? Why not take a rest. Go and get some sleep. 
HOBSON: How can I rest with that thing up the spout. You know the score as well as I do. Five units off centre we lift half London into space. Five more and the Atlantic water level goes up three feet. Rinberg just doesn't understand the pressure we're under. Hey, you! What do you thinking you're doing skulking there? 
BEN: Well, I was just wondering if I can help, sir. 
HOBSON: Help? How could you help? 
BENOIT: We could do with an extra pair of hands. He can help me. 
HOBSON: Well, keep him away from me, that's all. All right, I'll go and lie down. Call me if anything happens. 
BENOIT: Yes, of course. 
HOBSON: Oh, by the way. There were two more of those momentary drops in air pressure while I was on. I've put them in the log. 
BENOIT: Right. 
(Hobson leaves.) 
BENOIT: Well, there are some coffee cups to clear away if you wish to be helpful. And er, oh er, Ralph, that is, no. 14, needs a hand down in the food store. Can you find your way there? 
BEN: Yeah, I'll find it. 
BENOIT: Good boy.

[Food store]

(Ralph is loading a trolley with supplies from the shelves and ticking them off a list. He picks up a sack of sugar and the contents spill onto the floor through a hole in the bottom. He throws it into the waste disposal.) 
RALPH: (american) Anyone would think we've got rats up here. 
(A tin falls.) 
RALPH: Who's that? Who is it? 
BEN: It's only me, mate. 
RALPH: Oh, for heaven's sake. Don't go sneaking around like that. 
BEN: Blimey, you lot aren't half edgy. 
RALPH: You will be too, mate, if you've been up here long enough. Say, are you responsible for the broken bags here. 
BEN: Come off it. I've only just arrived, haven't I? 
RALPH: Okay. See and you can find that light. Round the back there, most likely. 
BEN: Okay. 
RALPH: Let's see. We still need some more milk and sugar. 
(As Ralph searches the shelves a huge figure looms out of the darkness. There's an electric shock sound. Ralph's body is dragged away before Ben returns.) 
BEN: Number 14? Ralph? Where are you? Scarpered. Funny bloke.

[Sickbay]

(Polly is dozing.) 
POLLY: What's that? 
DOCTOR: Shh. It's all right, Polly, it's only me. We don't want to wake everybody up, do we? You look as though you could do with some sleep yourself. 
POLLY: I'm all right. What have you got there? 
DOCTOR: Oh, I've been doing a little investigation. 
POLLY: A piece of silver paper. What is it? 
DOCTOR: I don't know. 
(The lights dim.) 
POLLY: What's happened? 
DOCTOR: Oh, it's nothing. It probably just a changeover in the time cycle. 
POLLY: What do you mean? 
DOCTOR: Oh well, you see, it's rather interesting really. You see, on the moon they have a fortnight of days and a fortnight of nights. 
POLLY: Well? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's obvious, isn't it? They have to make their own day and night artificially up here, or it would upset their whole biological time clock. 
POLLY: Their what? 
DOCTOR: They won't know whether they were coming or going. Get it? 
POLLY: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Clever girl. QED. That's why it's dark up here. 
POLLY: Oh, I see what you mean. Yes, of course. How stupid of me. 
DOCTOR: Of course along at the control centre it's probably broad daylight. Polly, you wouldn't be making fun of me, would you? 
POLLY: No. 
(A man screams.) 
POLLY: Doctor Evans! 
(Evans is sweating heavily, and delirious.) 
EVANS: The hand. No, don't touch me. No. The silver hand. (scream) 
POLLY: Doctor, is he? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid he is. 
POLLY: What are we going to do? 
DOCTOR: What did he mean by the silver hand? I'd better report this to Mister Hobson.

[Control room]

(Ben is reporting Ralph's disappearance.) 
HOBSON: Can't find him? Ralph? 
BEN: Well, I was helping him load some stores and he just disappeared. 
HOBSON: What, in this place? Well, there are only nineteen of us. 
DOCTOR: Have you tried his quarters? 
BEN: Yeah. 
HOBSON: Why didn't you report this to me? 
BEN: Well, I'm just telling you now, aren't I? 
HOBSON: Now what is the matter? 
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry. It's Doctor Evans. 
HOBSON: Well? 
DOCTOR: I'm afraid he's dead. 
HOBSON: Dead? No. 
BENOIT: This must be reported at once. 
HOBSON: Yes, yes. No! No, we haven't got enough data yet. You know what they're like down there. I'll come to the sick bay with you. Come on.

[Sickbay]

(Polly is helping Jamie drink a glass of water.) 
POLLY: Here. Gently, Jamie. 
(Jamie's eyes widen in panic as he sees something behind Polly.) 
POLLY: Jamie! 
(Jamie tries to speak, then passes out again. Polly turns and screams. The Doctor, Hobson and others run in.) 
HOBSON: What the matter? 
POLLY: Something just went out of that door! 
HOBSON: Nils! John! 
DOCTOR: What was it? 
NILS: Nothing. Nothing there. 
HOBSON: Your nerves are getting the better of you. Where's Evans' body? 
POLLY: Over there. 
HOBSON: All right, let's get it over. 
(Nils lifts the blanket but the bed is empty.) 
HOBSON: Is this someone's idea of a particularly bad joke? 
DOCTOR: This is no joke, believe me! 
BENOIT: Mister Hobson, Mister Hobson, you are wanted! Another man's collapsed at the controls. The Gravitron has gone off alignment again. 
HOBSON: Come on! And you'd better find that doctor's body or out you all go, quarantine or no quarantine. 
(Hobson, Benoit and co all leave.) 
POLLY: I don't understand what could have happened. I must have dozed off or something. One thing I am sure of. Something went out of that door just as you came in. 
DOCTOR: That body can't just have vanished. Polly, I'm going to leave you alone, now just for a minute. 
POLLY: All right. 
JAMIE: Water. Water. 
POLLY: I'll go and get you some. 
JAMIE: Water. 
(Polly leaves. The other door slides open and a tall figure moves across the room to Jamie's bed. Jamie looks at it.)
JAMIE: It's you. The phantom piper!

Episode Two

[Sickbay]

(Jamie suddenly sits up and stares at the tall silver figure in front of him. It has a blank metal face with round eye holes and a slit for the mouth. Tubes come from where its ears should be and connect at a round device on the top of it's head. We seen something like this before, but Jamie hasn't.) 
JAMIE: No! No, I'll not go with you. Do you hear me, piper? No, leave me. Leave me, I'll not go with you, do you hear me? Leave me. No, I'll not go with you. 
(The cyberman goes round the other beds.) 
JAMIE: I'll fight you every inch of the way. I'll not go with ya. No. No. 
(The cyberman takes the blanket off another patient and carries off the struggling man.) 
JAMIE: Leave me, piper. No, leave me, I'll not go. 
(Polly returns with the water for Jamie. She screams. Hobson, the Doctor, Ben and two other men run in.) 
DOCTOR: Polly! Polly, what's happened? 
POLLY: Oh, Doctor! Doctor, it was horrible. A great creature like a, like a Cyberman. 
DOCTOR: It's all right. Don't be frightened. Whatever it was, it's all gone now. 
POLLY: Yes, but Doctor, the Cyberman was carrying one of the patients out! 
DOCTOR: Cyberman? 
HOBSON: Cyberman? What are you talking about? 
POLLY: I'm sure it was. I'm sure it was! 
DOCTOR: Are you sure? 
JAMIE: I'll not go with you! 
BEN: All right, mate. You're safe now. Take it easy. 
POLLY: Yes it did, I promise you. 
HOBSON: She's right. There's another one gone. Sam, Jules, you've got to find these men. They can't just disappear in a place this size. Search every square inch, don't come back until you've found them. Now move. 
(Sam and Jules leave.) 
HOBSON: Now, supposing you tell me your story. What did you see? 
POLLY: Well, I went out to get Jamie some water and when I came back I saw this giant man or creature or something just going out of the door carrying one of the patients like a doll. I think it was a Cyberman. 
HOBSON: Forget the Cyberman part. Then what? 
POLLY: Well, then nothing. The door shut and then you came in. 
HOBSON: What do you know about all this? 
DOCTOR: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
HOBSON: We'll see about that in a minute. This thing you saw, what was it like? 
POLLY: It was enormous and silver, and it had holes in it's head for eyes, like a robot! 
HOBSON: A robot? 
BEN: But the Cybermen were all killed when Mondas blew up, weren't they? 
HOBSON: Stop this Cyberman nonsense. There were Cybermen, every child knows that, but they were all destroyed ages ago. 
DOCTOR: So we all thought. 
HOBSON: That's enough. Now let's have a little calm thinking. For the past two weeks a completely unknown disease has appeared in the base. People drop in their tracks, they develop this black pattern on their skin. Then some of the patients disappear, right? Well, they can't leave the base without wearing space suits, and there are no space suits missing, so where are they? 
DOCTOR: I must say it does sound a little odd. 
HOBSON: More than a little. Well I do know one thing. A new disease starts, people disappear and then you turn up. 
POLLY: And you think we did it. 
BEN: Oh, come off it, we haven't done a thing. 
HOBSON: That's as maybe. I don't know who you are, what you are or where you come from. But you can get off the moon now. 
BEN: Yeah, well that suits me fine. The sooner the better. 
DOCTOR: No, Ben. We can't go yet. 
BEN: Well, why not? They don't want us here. 
DOCTOR: Because there is something evil here and we must stay. 
HOBSON: Evil? Don't be daft. 
DOCTOR: Evil is what I meant. There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything that we believe in. They must be fought. This disease, for instance. It isn't really a disease at all, but I can help you with it. You'll see. I'll find the cause for you. 
HOBSON: Will you, indeed? 
DOCTOR: Yes, certainly. I just need to examine a few things, that's all. It should be simple. 
HOBSON: Well, I'm not sure. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you just one Earth day cycle to find the cause. 
BEN: Earth what? 
HOBSON: Twenty four hours. 
BEN: But that's no time at all. 
HOBSON: It's all the time you're going to get. Then you get off the moon, complete with this bloke here. 
POLLY: But you can't move him. He's very ill. 
DOCTOR: We accept. Now tell me, you have pathological equipment here, yes? 
HOBSON: Yes, Evans was working on an extensive research project. It's all in here. 
(They go to an area marked off by a ring of workbenches and shelves.) 
DOCTOR: Yes, I'll have a look in here. 
HOBSON: It's quite a small unit. We're not equipped to deal with a full scale epidemic, you understand. Do you think you can manage? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I can. 
HOBSON: Right. Well, I'll leave you to it. But don't forget, twenty four hours. 
(Hobson leaves. The Doctor takes a tray of items over to a patient.) 
BEN: What are you going to do, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: We're going to start with this one. 
POLLY: Listen, are you really a medical doctor? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I was once, Polly. I think I took a degree once in Glasgow. 1888 I think. Lister. Hold that for me, will you? 
(The Doctor swabs a black-lined hand, and the arm convulses.) 
DOCTOR: It's all right. He's quite unconscious. 
BEN: Well look, what can we do to help? 
DOCTOR: I shall need to examine everything. Clothes, boots, food, towels, soap, everything. Will you get them for me, please? 
POLLY: Have you any idea what it might be? 
DOCTOR: No. Not an idea. But we'll find it out.

[Control room]

HOBSON: I don't understand it. I'm sure there's a lack of co-ordination somewhere. 
BENOIT: Yes, but where? 
HOBSON: On the indicators, look. It should be steady as a rock. 
BENOIT: The fault must be in the gravitron. 
HOBSON: Nils, here. 
NILS: Yes Hobby? 
HOBSON: I'm going to run a test. Move the probe and we'll see if the indicators move the right distance on the map. Okay? 
NILS: Right. 
HOBSON: Benoit, keep an eye on the probe itself, will you? 
BENOIT: Okay. All yours, Bob. 
BOB: Right. 
(Benoit walks over to watch the gravitron probe.) 
HOBSON: Deflect probe five degrees, now. Way off. Five degrees should put them over Iceland. Move the probe back again. 
NILS: Right. 
BENOIT: The probe seems to deflect all right. 
HOBSON: The fault must be here. This could be a major disaster if we can't stabilise the Earth's field. 
NILS: If we lose that hurricane, Mister Hobson, all hell will break loose on the Earth. I've a wife and family. 
HOBSON: Yeah, you're not the only one. Roger, check the potentiometers. 
BENOIT: Right. 
(Benoit puts on a helmet and enters the control area.) 
HOBSON: Nils, check the gravitation units. Shake it up. We haven't got much time. 
NILS: Field stabilising at 48, Mister Hobson. 
HOBSON: Prepare to move probe. Check co-ordinates. We've got to hold that hurricane in the Pacific. Stand by. Now. 
(Benoit returns.) 
BENOIT: Twenty degree tilt complete. 
HOBSON: The field's not correcting. We'll have to increase the reactor power. 
BENOIT: You can't do that. The torus will burn out. 
HOBSON: It's all we can do. 
(The communication centre comes into life.) 
CONTROL [OC]: International Space Control. 
R/T: Earth calling. 
CONTROL [OC]: Earth calling Moon Weather Control. Stand by. Stand by for the controller. 
R/T: This is Moonbase. Come in please. 
CONTROL [OC]: We wish to speak to Mister Hobson. 
HOBSON: Hobson speaking. 
CONTROL [OC]: Stand by for the Controller. 
HOBSON: Right. He's actually going to speak to us this time. 
RINBERG [OC]: Controller Rinberg speaking. Is that you, Hobson? 
HOBSON: Yes, Rinberg. 
RINBERG [OC]: The directional fields are showing a progressive error. Reports have come in of wide-spread pressure fluctuations in Atlantic zone 6. You must get the gravitron back into balance. 
HOBSON: We're trying to compensate by re-aligning the probe. We have an error in the servos. 
RINBERG [OC]: Well, there's no sign of any improvement here. We've just had a report from Miami, Florida. Thirty minutes ago they were enjoying clear skies and a heat wave. Now Hurricane Lucy is right overhead. 
BENOIT: There is only one thing to do. 
HOBSON: What's that? 
BENOIT: Shut it down. 
HOBSON: What, switch the gravitron off?! 
BENOIT: Yes, it's the only chance. 
HOBSON: We can't do that, man. The collapse of the gravity would devastate half the globe. There'd be storms, whirlwinds, hurricanes. 
RINBERG [OC]: I overheard your conversation. It's quite out of the question. You're not to shut down the gravitron under any circumstances, and that's an order. I think perhaps you don't appreciate how serious the situation already is. 
HOBSON: I bet he gets a knighthood. 
RINBERG [OC]: We spent years in a general assembly negotiating methods of agreement between farmers and landowners and so on. Now the weather's out of control they're after our blood, and I must say I can't blame them. You've got to get that thing under control, quickly. Now please get on with it. 
CONTROL [OC]: Earth control, over and out. 
HOBSON: Well, you're all in the picture. We've got trouble, bad trouble, we haven't got much time. We're going to run through every circuit, every field pattern, every damn nut and bolt on Charlie boy in there until he's running sweet and smooth. A full class A test, in fact. Now you all know what to do so let's get on with it. 
MEN: Okay, Chief. 
HOBSON: Right, we'll start on the main tape programme. 
BENOIT: Right.

[Computer room]

(A proper computer bank, with turning magnetic tapes and stuff.) 
NILS: It's running now. 
HOBSON: Right, give me the analogue value on module 6, will you? 
BENOIT: Will do. They look all right. A at 10 millivolts. B at 15 millivolts, C at 26. That fits, doesn't it? 
HOBSON: Yes, they're at normal levels. Roger, finish checking here, will you? The answer may be in the control panel. 
BENOIT: Okay. I'll sing out the binary conversion values, you check them on read out, okay? 
NILS: Right. 
BENOIT: Right. 
(The Doctor has stuck in and is taking samples of fibres from Benoit's shirt.) 
BENOIT: Channel one. 
NILS: Jah. 
BENOIT: Eight. 
NILS: Right. 
BENOIT: One. 
NILS: Mm-hm. 
BENOIT: Three. 
NILS: Jah. 
BENOIT: Four. 
(The Doctor starts plucking at Benoit's trouser leg.) 
NILS: Jah. 
BENOIT: Six. 
NILS: Right. 
BENOIT: Eight. 
NILS: Right. 
BENOIT: Twelve. 
NILS: Jah. 
BENOIT: Right? 
NILS: Right. All spot on. 
BENOIT: Right. 
(Benoit notices the Doctor and turns on him.) 
BENOIT: Eh là, qu'est-ce que vous fabriquez ici, imbécile d'idiot! Vous n'avez rien d'autre à faire? Vous croyez que nous sommes en train de nous amuser? Oh, come on. Get out of the way. 
DOCTOR: Enchanté, monsieur.

[Control room]

BENOIT: Now, where were we? Ah, yes, the fluid servo pressures. I reckon this is probably where the fault is. 
NILS: Er, do you want them all or just the main tank readings? 
BENOIT: The main will do. 
NILS: Right. Header one, 45 pounds. 
BENOIT: Yes. 
NILS: Header two, 47 
BENOIT: Yes. 
NILS: Three, 42. 
(The Doctor starts unfastening Nils' bootlaces.) 
BENOIT: Yes. 
NILS: Sine values equivalent. 
BENOIT: They all fit. Nothing there. 
NILS: It must be the potentiometer net, then. 
BENOIT: Looks like it. Take us some time to do that. We'll need the digital voltmeter. 
NILS: Right, I'll get it. 
(Nils steps out of his boot.) 
HOBSON: What the blazes are you doing? 
DOCTOR: I'm just collecting specimens. 
HOBSON: Specimens? Oh, yes. Well, get on with it.

[Sickbay]

BEN: We're nearly out of this interferon stuff. 
POLLY: Oh. Well you'd better go and ask Mister Hobson where the rest is. 
BEN: Yeah, right. 
(Ben leaves. Jamie groans.) 
POLLY: Shh. It's all right, Jamie, it's all right. You're going to get better but you must lie still. 
JAMIE: Oh, what is this place? Is it the home of the piper? 
POLLY: No, we're on the moon. You know, the moon, up in the sky. 
JAMIE: Oh no, I can't be alive. I've just seen the piper. 
(Jamie sits up. The cyberman is standing there. Polly tries to get away but it fires an electric sounding charge at her head and she collapses.) 
JAMIE: The piper! I knew! 
(The cyberman shocks Jamie unconscious then carries off the man in the next bed. The Doctor enters with his tray of samples.) 
DOCTOR: Polly! What's happened? Polly. Are you all right?

[Control room]

(The place is a hive of activity.) 
HOBSON: Anything out on the probe's servos? 
BENOIT: The error detectors show a slight discrepancy, in normal limits, though. 
HOBSON: What about the overall feedback valve? We haven't checked that. 
BENOIT: No, that's an idea. 
HOBSON: You know, I don't think it's likely to be a mechanical fault. 
JOE: Mister Hobson, an air pressure drop again. 
HOBSON: Same as before? 
JOE: Yes, just the same. Lasts about five seconds. 
HOBSON: Something's odd. It's not the pumps, I'm sure of that. Has anyone asked permission to leave the base? 
JOE: No. As far as I know, the compression chamber's empty. 
HOBSON: If I find anybody's been fooling about in there without permission, I'll tear their hides off.

[Store room]

(Bags fall down from a pile against the wall as a cyberman pushes his way in through a hole before rebuilding the stack to hide it again.)

[Control room]

JOE: The pressure's up again now, sir. 
HOBSON: Thank heaven for that. I'm going to check over the control loop monitor. 
BENOIT: Control loop monitor? Huh. I think you're wasting your time. 
HOBSON: Nothing's a waste of time till we trace this fault, and don't you forget it! You saw what's happening on Earth. We can't afford to miss anything. Now get on with it! 
SAM: I think I've found something! 
HOBSON: What is it? 
SAM: One of the probe control antennae. 
BENOIT: Well, what's the matter with it? 
SAM: Well, according to these readings there are at least two pieces of it missing. It's just not coordinating. 
HOBSON: Missing? 
BENOIT: Meteorites? 
HOBSON: Could be. There could be a simpler explanation. Roger, when did these people arrive here? 
BENOIT: The end of period 11 in this present lunar day. 
HOBSON: And when did the gravitron start playing up? 
BENOIT: About the beginning of period 12. 
HOBSON: Sam, when was the last time we had anyone outside? 
SAM: During period 13. Two men went outside to realign one of the solar mirrors. 
HOBSON: That's it. 
BENOIT: I'm not quite with you. 
HOBSON: Well, it's simple. Strangers arrive period 11, the gravitron goes up the spout period 12. 
BENOIT: I understand. But it can't 
HOBSON: Come on. It's time we put that Doctor and his friend in cold storage. Just a second. Get two men outside to look at the antennae, will you, Sam? 
SAM: Okay. Right, Joe, nip along to the mess deck, tell Jules and Franz I want them here pretty sharpish. 
JOE: Right. 
(Ben enters.) 
HOBSON: Well, now what is it? 
BEN: Another patient's gone, sir. 
HOBSON: What? Come on!

[Airlock]

(Jules and Franz enter, wearing space suits. They check each other's equipment then open the doors. They climb ladders, open two more doors and step out.)

[Sickbay]

(The Doctor is examining slides on a microscope.) 
DOCTOR: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
POLLY: Isn't there any clue at all? 
DOCTOR: No. It's a complete blank. All the tests are negative. As far as I can see this whole ridiculous place is completely sterile. 
POLLY: We'll have to go and tell Mister Hobson, I suppose. 
DOCTOR: He's not going to like it very much. I simply don't understand it. 
POLLY: Doctor, it wouldn't, I mean it couldn't possibly have anything to do with Lister, could it? 
DOCTOR: Lister? 
POLLY: Well, I mean, you did say that you took your degree in Glasgow in 1888. It does seem an awful long time from now, 2070 or whatever it is. 
DOCTOR: Polly, are you suggesting that I'm not competent to carry out these tests? 
POLLY: Oh, no. No, no, no, no. I was just wondering if there was anything that Joseph Lister didn't know in 1888 that might possibly help you now. 
DOCTOR: Shh! Somebody's coming. It's Mister Hobson, out for blood. Ours. Look busy. Quick! 
(Hobson and Ben enter.) 
HOBSON: That's as might be, but that's the third person to disappear in the past few hours. It's completely illogical. Single beds, no way to get out. 
DOCTOR: Do you mind?! 
HOBSON: What? 
DOCTOR: Would you mind standing away from the door and allowing it to close? The slides, the dust. 
HOBSON: Okay. It must be you people. We've got some straight talking to do, you and I. 
DOCTOR: Polly. 
POLLY: Yes? 
DOCTOR: Another boot. 
POLLY: Right. 
HOBSON: Do you hear me? 
DOCTOR: This is extraordinary. 
POLLY: Excuse me, please. 
DOCTOR: Thank you. 
HOBSON: Now look here. 
DOCTOR: Excuse me, please. We are trying to help you, you know. 
HOBSON: Help? Is that what you call it? You can all get off the moon now. 
POLLY: Now, wait a minute, you said 
HOBSON: I don't care what I said. 
DOCTOR: Ah! 
HOBSON: Found something? 
DOCTOR: I think perhaps I have. 
HOBSON: Really? 
DOCTOR: Yes, I may be onto something, but I must have some room. How can I work under these conditions? Now out, please! Come along, outside. I'm trying to work in here! Ben, see that they stay outside. 
(The Moonbase personnel are hustled out.) 
POLLY: Doctor, did you mean that? 
DOCTOR: What? 
POLLY: You've found something. 
DOCTOR: Oh, Polly, I only wish I had. Why not make some coffee to keep them all happy while I think of something? 
POLLY: All right.

[Lunar surface]

(Jules and Franz start checking the antennae when two shadows loom over them. The cybermen club them to ground, knocking them out.)

[Outside Sickbay]

(The Doctor comes out of sickbay.) 
HOBSON: Here, Doctor. You've completed your examination? 
DOCTOR: Yes, just about. 
HOBSON: Turned the base upside down, poked into everything? 
DOCTOR: Yes, clothes, boots, food. 
HOBSON: And you've found? 
DOCTOR: Absolutely nothing. 
HOBSON: Just as I thought. 
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. 
HOBSON: So what I told you still stands. 
(Polly brings a tray.) 
DOCTOR: Ah, coffee. Splendid. Thank you, Polly. I think we could all do with a cup. 
HOBSON: Benoit, you'd better go outside and see how Jules and Franz are getting on. 
BENOIT: Right.

[Lunar surface]

(There are two empty space suits lying by the antennae.)

[Outside Sickbay]

POLLY: Coffee? 
HOBSON: Well, Doctor.
POLLY: Sugar? 
HOBSON: Oh, thank you. 
POLLY: It's very hot. Doctor, what about you? 
DOCTOR: Thank you, Polly. 
HOBSON: Well, Doctor, as I was saying, you've had your chance and you've come up with absolutely nothing. Now I want 
(Number 15 has just taken a mouthful of coffee when he groans and collapses.) 
DOCTOR: Don't touch him! Let me look. 
(Black lines spread quickly across the man's skin.) 
HOBSON: Here, Charlie and you, what's your name, Ben, give us a hand to get him into the medical unit. 
DOCTOR: Try not to touch his skin. 
(The stricken man is carried away.) 
DOCTOR: Don't drink that! 
HOBSON: What the hell? 
DOCTOR: It's the sugar! Don't you see? That's why the disease doesn't affect everyone. It's the sugar. Not everyone takes it. No, don't touch it. 
(The Doctor uses forceps to pick up the sugar dispenser.)

[Sickbay]

(The Doctor pours some sugar onto a microscope slide.) 
HOBSON: What are you doing? 
DOCTOR: Just be patient. Just as I thought. A large neurotropic virus. 
HOBSON: What, like the space plague? 
DOCTOR: No. It's a large, infective agent that only attacks the nerves. That's why the patients have got these lines on their faces and their hands. It follows the course of the nerves under the skin. 
HOBSON: That's all very well, but how did it get in here? 
DOCTOR: Oh, it is the Cybermen. I believe they have deliberately infected the base. 
HOBSON: My men have searched every square inch of the base. There's no space to hide a cat, let alone a Cyberman! Anyhow, how did they get in? 
DOCTOR: One moment. 
HOBSON: What is it? 
DOCTOR: You say you searched all the base? 
HOBSON: Yes. What of it? 
DOCTOR: Every nook and cranny? 
HOBSON: Yes. 
DOCTOR: No chance of anyone hiding anywhere? 
HOBSON: None whatever. 
DOCTOR: Did your men search in here? 
HOBSON: Well 
DOCTOR: Did they? 
HOBSON: Well, there were always people in here, so they probably 
DOCTOR: Did they search in here? 
HOBSON: No! 
POLLY: But there's nowhere in here they could hide. 
(The Doctor round sickbay until they come to a bed where a body is covered by a blanket, but large silver boots are sticking out.) 
POLLY: Oh, no. No, no, no. 
DOCTOR: (sotto) Back. 
(The cyberman throws back the blanket and leaps out of the bed, weapon ready. )

Episode Three

[Sickbay]  

CYBERMAN 1: Stand back. Stand back from that door. 
(It is a much more mechanical voice than the last time we met them.) 
HOBSON: You're right. It is them. 
(Bob rushes to the cyberman with a metal bar.) 
HOBSON: Quick! Get out of here! 
(A second cyberman appears and fires his weapon.) 
DOCTOR: No! 
(Bob falls, smoke coming from his body.) 
CYBERMAN 1: Remain still. 
HOBSON: You devils. You killed him! An unarmed man. 
CYBERMAN 1: Get up. See that they remain there. 
CYBERMAN 2: Yes. 
(Cyberman 1 uses the transmitter on his chest to contact their ship.) 
CYBERMAN 1: Operational system two now complete. Operational system two now complete.

[Space ship]

CYBERMAN 1 [OC]: Ready to start Operational system three 
CYBERMAN 3: Understood. Operational system three will now begin.

[Sickbay]

CYBERMAN 1: You are known to us. 
DOCTOR: And you to me. 
CYBERMAN 1: Silence. Who is in command? 
HOBSON: I am. 
CYBERMAN 1: You will be needed. 
HOBSON: What have you done with my men? 
CYBERMAN 1: They will return. 
HOBSON: They're not dead? 
CYBERMAN 1: No. They are not dead. They are altered. 
BEN: Altered? What have you done to them? 
CYBERMAN 1: They are now controlled. 
HOBSON: If you do anything to my 
CYBERMAN 1: You will do nothing. 
(The second cyberman examines the patients and then gets to Jamie.) 
CYBERMAN 2: This one has not received neurotrope X. Stand back. 
POLLY: Please, leave him alone. His head is hurt. He's had an accident. 
CYBERMAN 2: His head? Then he would be of no value. The others are ready for conversion. 
CYBERMAN 1: You will now take us to the control centre. 
HOBSON: I'll be damned if 
(The cyberman points his weapon at Hobson.) 
HOBSON: It's through here. 
(Hobson, the cyberman and the Doctor leave.) 
CYBERMAN 2: You will remain here. If you leave you will be converted like the others. 
(That cyberman leaves.) 
BEN: I don't like that word converted.

[Space ship]

(Doctor Evans, Franz and Ralph are being converted. They are all fitted with a metal headpiece.) 
CYBERMAN 3: Raise your left arm. 
(The three men lift their left arms.) 
CYBERMAN 3: Raise your right arm. 
CYBERMAN 4: Control is excellent. Transfer that one to the capsule. 
(Two cybermen wheel in a man-sized canister. Evans is locked inside it.)

[Control room]

BENOIT: It's about time that we heard from those two outside. Let's have a word with them. 
NILS: All yours, Roger. 
BENOIT: Surface party, come in please. Surface party, come in please. Surface party, come in. We are not receiving you. Over. Can we see the control antenna from here? 
NILS: No, Roger. It's just around that first block outside the main port. 
BENOIT: Well, we'll have to send someone else out so get ready to 
(Hobson enters.) 
HOBSON: Get back! Get back! These things are lethal. 
CYBERMAN 1: No one will move. You will remain still. If you move you will be killed. 
BENOIT: What are they? How did they get in? 
CYBERMAN 1: Silence. We are Cybermen. You will listen. 
BENOIT: But you were all killed! 
CYBERMAN 1: We are going to take over the Gravitron and use it to destroy the surface of the Earth by changing the weather. 
DOCTOR: But that will kill everybody on the Earth. 
CYBERMAN 1: Yes. 
HOBSON: You're supposed to be so advanced. Here you are taking your revenge like, like children. 
CYBERMAN 1: Revenge? What is that? 
HOBSON: A feeling people have when 
CYBERMAN 1: Feelings? Feelings? Yes, we know of this weakness of yours. We are fortunate. We do not posses feelings. 
BENOIT: Then why are you here? 
CYBERMAN 1: To eliminate all dangers. 
HOBSON: But you'll kill every living thing on the Earth. 
CYBERMAN 1: Yes. All dangers will be eliminated. 
BENOIT: Have you no mercy? 
CYBERMAN 1: It is unnecessary. Keep watch on them. 
(Cyberman 1 moves away to activate his communicator.) 
HOBSON: Don't rush him, Nils. 
CYBERMAN 1: Operational system four. Operation system four. 
CYBERMAN 3 [OC]: Operational system four complete. Entry to base now completed. 
HOBSON: Entry? How did you get in? 
CYBERMAN 1: It was very simple. Only stupid Earth brains like yours would have been fooled. 
HOBSON: Go on. 
CYBERMAN 1: Since we couldn't approach direct, we came up under the surface and cut our way in through your store room, contaminating your food supply on the way. A simple hole, that's all. 
HOBSON: A hole! That explains those sudden air pressure drops we've been recording. 
CYBERMAN 1: Clever. Clever. Clever.

[Sickbay]

(Polly is looking at her battered finger nails as Jamie tries to get out of bed.) 
POLLY: Hey, what do you think you're doing? You seem to be better. 
JAMIE: Aye, I feel myself again. 
POLLY: Lie back there. 
JAMIE: But I'm better! Oh, my head. 
BEN: Yeah, well take it easy, mate. 
POLLY: At least, you know it's not your McCrimmon piper, anyway. 
JAMIE: It had me worried though, I admit that. 
BEN: Yeah, those Cybermen have got us all worried, mate. We've see them in action before. 
POLLY: They must have some weakness. 
BEN: They have, don't you remember? They can't stand radiation. 
POLLY: But where do we find that here? 
BEN: There's the Gravitron power pack but that's thermonuclear. No one can get near it once its going. 
POLLY: Why not? 
BEN: Well because Duchess, the temperature inside is about four million degrees, that's all. 
JAMIE: Well, in my day, they used to sprinkle witches with holy water. 
BEN: Fat lot of use that would be on them. 
POLLY: Sprinkle. Holy Water. Ben? 
BEN: Yeah? 
POLLY: What are the Cybermen covered in? 
BEN: As far as I know, their suit is a metal of some sort. 
POLLY: Oh. What about that thing on their chests? You know, the part which replaces their heart and lungs. 
BEN: Some kind of plastic, I think. 
POLLY: I thought so. You see, it's simple. Nail varnish remover dissolves nail varnish. Nail varnish is a plastic. So we do what Jamie says. We sprinkle them, see? 
BEN: No, I don't. Clear as mud if you ask me. 
POLLY: Well anyway, I'm going to try an experiment. 
BEN: Yes, Professor.

[Control room]

(Ralph, Evans and Jules enter, followed by a cyberman.) 
HOBSON: Jules! Doctor Evans! I thought he was all dead. I thought they were all dead. 
BENOIT: Better if they were by the look of it. 
CYBERMAN 1: You will leave your places. Go over there. 
(The technicians go to stand by the wall. It speaks to Hobson and Benoit.) 
CYBERMAN 1: You will move. Tell the operators in the power unit to come out. Now. 
HOBSON: All right, you can all see what's happening. Come out. Leave the machine and don't try anything. 
(The power control crew enter the control room.) 
CYBERMAN 1: They will now take over the Gravitron power unit. 
CYBERMAN 2: Yes. 
(The converted men file into the power room.) 
BENOIT: But you can't send them in there without the protective helmets. 
CYBERMAN 1: Why? 
BENOIT: The machine produces very intense sonic fields. Without the helmets, those men will be insane in a few hours. 
CYBERMAN 1: How many hours? 
BENOIT: Twelve, possibly. 
CYBERMAN 1: Then there is no problem. 
BENOIT: Why? 
CYBERMAN 1: Our purpose will be achieved before that. 
BENOIT: But what about the men? 
CYBERMAN 1: They will be disposed of. 
(The Doctor has been watching the cybermen carefully. He edges over to the R/T unit and turns up the volume, then resets it when a cyberman turns.)

[Sickbay]

(Polly has collected lots of bottles.) 
POLLY: Ben? 
BEN: Yeah? 
POLLY: What is nail varnish remover? 
BEN: It's a sort of thinner, something like acetone I think. 
POLLY: Acetone, of course. Great, we've got some of that. Now, keep your fingers crossed. 
(Polly drops some plastic into the acetone and watches it dissolve.) 
POLLY: It's works! 
BEN: But I still don't know what you're on about. 
POLLY: If we can sprinkle some of that on their chest units, it might help to soften them. 
BEN: I get it! You mean it'll clobber their controls or something. 
POLLY: Yes, that's it. 
BEN: Yeah, but how do we know that acetone will dissolve their sort of plastic? 
POLLY: I hadn't thought of that. 
BEN: Just a moment though, if we make up a mixture. 
POLLY: Of all the solvents. 
BEN: What have we got? 
POLLY: Benzene, ether, alcohol. 
BEN: We brew a right old cocktail. 
POLLY: Yes. Wait a minute, how are we going to throw it at them? 
BEN: Well, in bottles, I suppose. Now just a tick though. I've got a better idea.

[Control room]

CYBERMAN 1: Prepare to align the field rectors. 
(The controlled humans obey.) 
CYBERMAN 1: Main power into vortex generators now. Servo pumps to full pressure. 
HOBSON: Why did they go to so such trouble? 
DOCTOR: What do you mean? 
HOBSON: Why didn't they operate the controls themselves? 
(The Doctor goes back to the R/T unit and adjusts the volume and pitch once more. The controlled men lose coordination.) 
CYBERMAN 1: What is happening? 
CYBERMAN 2: There is loss of control. 
DOCTOR: (sotto) Thought so. Sonic control. That should be easy. 
(He resets the dials.) 
DOCTOR: (sotto) Funny. Funny. Go to all that trouble to make the men do the work. Why? Do it themselves, easy. They're using the men as tools. Why? Don't know. Yes, I do though. There must be something in here they don't like. Pressure? Electricity? Radiation? Maybe. Gravity! Now there's a thought. Gravity. Oh, yes. Gravity. 
CYBERMAN 1: Start probe generators. Realign the probe. Probe field to full power now. 
HOBSON: They'll devastate the whole Earth when that field takes hold. 
BENOIT: We've got to do something. 
CONTROL [OC]: Earth Control calling Moonbase. Come in, please. 
CYBERMAN 1: Remain still. 
CONTROL [OC]: Hello, Moonbase. Come in, please. 
CYBERMAN 1: You will all be silent. 
CONTROL [OC]: Moonbase, come in, please. Hello? Reading on five centimetre band. Come in. Your last routine signal was not received. Over. We are not receiving you. Over. If you hear us and cannot transmit, fire sodium rocket. We shall see flare. 
CYBERMAN 1: What does that mean? 
HOBSON: It's a distress rocket. It ejects sodium into space and then the sun lights the sodium into a yellow flare. 
CYBERMAN 1: What will your Earth do if they do not see the flare? 
HOBSON: Well, they'll think we're all dead. They'll do nothing. 
CONTROL [OC]: Standing by to observe flare. Standing by. 
(A cyberman turns the transmitter off. Hobson whispers to Benoit.) 
HOBSON: If they don't get our next transmission, they'll send up a relief rocket.

[Sickbay]

BEN: So, get it? This bottle holds the stuff that puts the fire out and this cylinder pushes gas into the bottle so that stuff squirts out here. Now, all we've got to do is to undo it. Phoar. Empty it and fill it with Polly cocktail. 
POLLY: I've got it all ready here. 
BEN: Good. What did you put in it? 
POLLY: Let's think. Benzene, ether, alcohol, acetone and epoxy-propane. 
BEN: Blimey, one of them should do it. Now, we'll need another one of these. 
JAMIE: Right, I'll get it. 
BEN: No, you stay where you are, Jamie. 
POLLY: Jamie, you're not well enough. 
JAMIE: It takes more than a wee crack on the head to keep a McCrimmon down. 
BEN: Look mate, we don't want you cracking up on us. I'm sure Polly's very impressed. 
JAMIE: Look, I said I was better. Would you like me to prove it to you? 
BEN: Any time, mate. 
POLLY: Look, come on. Haven't we got enough trouble without you two fighting each other? 
JAMIE: I go. 
BEN: Oh well, come on then. Not you, Polly. This is men's work.

[Control room]

(One of the controlled men collapses.) 
HOBSON: You'll kill them. 
CYBERMAN 2: If you will not remain silent you will be put under brain control. 
(The cyberman adjusts his control box and the controlled human jumps up again.)

[Corridor]

BEN: Polly. I thought that I told you to stay behind. 
POLLY: I'm coming with you. 
JAMIE: You'll maybe get hurt. Now go back. 
POLLY: I'm coming with you and that's flat! You still need someone to look after you 
JAMIE: I don't want 
BEN: There's no time for arguments. If you're coming, come on. 
(They go to the control room door.) 
BEN: Now look, we've only got one chance. When I open the door, drop down as low as you can, aim this things at their chests and squirt like mad. Right? 
JAMIE: Right. 
BEN: Now get ready.

[Control room]

(A cyberman hears something outside.) 
CYBERMAN 2: Someone is there. 
(A high pitched noise makes the controlled men freeze.) 
CYBERMAN 1: The beam is jammed. 
(The cybermen turn on the Doctor as Ben, Jamie and Polly burst into the room) 
BEN: Quickly, go and get their chest things! 
(They spray the cybermen's chest units, which instantly bubble and dissolve. Clutching helplessly at their chests, the cybermen collapse.) 
DOCTOR: Quick, get these things off their heads! 
(Ben, Jamie and Polly go into the gravitron room and removed the men's metal helmets. The men pass out.) 
HOBSON: Come on, get to your places! Quick, there's not a moment to lose. We've got to get the Gravitron down to safe level. 
POLLY: What about those poor men? 
HOBSON: Shift them along to the medical unit, quick as you can.

[Space ship]

CYBERLEADER: We are not receiving you. We are not receiving you. 
CYBERMAN 4: They must have failed. 
CYBERLEADER: Yes. We must invade now. Prepare the weapons. 
CYBERMAN 4: Yes.

[Control room]

BENOIT: Before all this, we lost contact with those two men outside. 
HOBSON: Well, send someone else out. 
BENOIT: Can't spare anyone. I'll go myself. 
HOBSON: Field strength is stable, isn't it? 
BENOIT: Yes. Yes, it's all right. 
HOBSON: Keep in R/T contract and be quick. 
BENOIT: Right. 
HOBSON: Nils? 
NILS: Jah? 
HOBSON: Hook your controls into Joe's channel, then get up into the dome and keep a eye on Roger when he's outside. 
NILS: Right.

[Lunar surface]

(By the antennae.) 
BENOIT: Hello Base, Hello Base. I've found them. At least, I've found their suits. They got them, I'm afraid.

[Control room]

HOBSON: Well, there's nothing we can do about that now. You'd better come inside as quick as you can. 
BENOIT [OC]: I will. 
NILS: Sir, sir! There's one of those things outside. He's after Roger Benoit. 
HOBSON: You hear that, Roger?

[Lunar surface]

BENOIT: Yes, I did, but he must be mistaken. There's none to be seen around here. 
(A cyberman appears and draws its weapon.) 
BENOIT: No! No! 
(The cyberman fires his weapon, but nothing happens.) 
BENOIT: Did you see that? Those things don't work in the vacuum!

[Control room]

(Ben is dismantling a fire extinguisher.) 
POLLY: Why can't you squirt it at them like you did just now? 
BEN: Because duchess, it would evaporate in the vacuum before it hits them. There, now come on. 
(Taking the glass cylinder full of solvent mix, Ben runs out. Outside, the cyberman chases Benoit, gaining on him all the time. At the airlock, Ben gets into a spacesuit. Benoit approaches the entry door.)

[Airlock]

(Ben exits the airlock as Benoit enters. Ben throws the glass cylinder at the cyberman's chest unit. It breaks, covering him in a cloud of vapour.) 
BEN: Come on, quick. 
(Ben gets back in with Benoit and they close the outer doors. Outside, the cyberman flails around as it's chest unit dissolves. In the vacuum, no one can hear it scream.)

[Control room]

NILS: They're in! That fellow Ben got one of them. 
JAMIE: That was Ben? 
HOBSON: Now listen, everybody. I don't know how many more of these Cybermen there are, but our point of view we're under siege. I'll reckon they will be back in a bit. Now, communications. Charlie, keep trying to get through to Earth. Right? 
CHARLIE: Right, will do. 
HOBSON: The rest of you, lower the armoured doors at all exits. And you, make up as much of that gubbins as you've got. We may need it. 
(Ben enters, with Benoit leaning on him.) 
DOCTOR: Well done, Ben! 
JAMIE: Well done. 
HOBSON: Ground radar? 
SAM [OC]: Ground radar speaking. 
HOBSON: Have you got a fix on their ship yet? 
SAM [OC]: Yes, Mister Hobson. We're getting a strong pulse from five four degrees north about three kilometres. 
HOBSON: That makes it just over the rim. 
DOCTOR: Mister Hobson, how far can the probe be lowered down? 
HOBSON: About thirty degrees. 
DOCTOR: That's no good. 
HOBSON: What do you mean? 
DOCTOR: Can any other part of it be lowered? 
HOBSON: Well, the main coil lenses can be shifted round without too much trouble, but why do you want to do 
NILS: There's something outside, sir! 
HOBSON: What is it? 
NILS: It's a long way off. 
HOBSON: I'll come.

[Observation dome]

POLLY: Oh, it's freezing. Do you think we should have our suits on? 
BEN: Oh, no, it's all right love. Get a gorgeous suntan. 
(Hobson looks through the telescope.) 
HOBSON: Can't see anything. 
NILS: Just to the left of the launching area. Round a bit to your left. 
HOBSON: Still can't see anything. 
BENOIT: (pointing) No, it's there, look! Reflections in the sun. 
HOBSON: You're right, there is something. 
(Two rows of cybermen march over the crater rim.) 
HOBSON: It's them. They're coming. Everybody inside, quick!

Episode Four

[Observation dome]

(Hobson is looking through the telescope by the gravitron probe.) 
DOCTOR: They can't just march in here, can they? 
HOBSON: Not now we've discovered how they got in. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes. They tunnelled into the store room. 
JAMIE: Doctor, Mister Hobson, come quickly. 
HOBSON: What is it?

[Control room]

CYBERLEADER [OC]: Moonbase. Moonbase. 
NILS: They've got our wavelength. We hear you. 
CYBERLEADER [OC]: You are surrounded. All resistance is useless. You must open the entry port. 
HOBSON: Let me. You're wasting your time. We've discovered your passageway and blocked it. You cannot enter now. 
CYBERLEADER [OC]: Resistance is useless. 
(Hobson turns the radio off.) 
POLLY: Can they get in? 
HOBSON: I don't know and I'm not stopping to find out. Get me Earth as quick as you can. 
NILS: Right. Weather Control Moon calling Earth. Come in, please. 
(Loud static hurts everyone's ears.) 
JAMIE: What's that? 
HOBSON: Switch that off. 
POLLY: What's that terrible noise? 
BEN: It wasn't like that before. 
HOBSON: We'll never hear anything through that if they're jamming it. 
BENOIT: Perhaps, or could it be. 
HOBSON: The aerial. They're having a go at the aerial. 
BENOIT: Where are you going? 
HOBSON: Out. 
BENOIT: You're crazy. They'd get you in a flash. 
HOBSON: Well, someone's got to go. 
DOCTOR: It's too late. Come and see.

[Observation dome]

(Through the telescope we see two cybermen destroying the antennae.) 
HOBSON: They get us every way, these creatures. 
DOCTOR: I refuse to believe that. Everything's got a weak point. It's just a question of waiting until it shows up, that's all.

[Control room]

BENOIT: They're bound to send a relief rocket within 12 hours, if no signals are received from us. 
BEN: A lot of good that is. 
NILS: Well, with all the trouble we've been giving them I'd say it's certain the rocket is on its way, sent off hours ago. Rinberg's very quick off the trigger, right, Hobby? 
HOBSON: I'm sure of it. With a replacement for me aboard, no doubt. 
POLLY: But that's wonderful! 
HOBSON: Thanks very much. 
POLLY: No, what I mean is, what are we all worrying about? The Cybermen can't get in and help is on its way. 
BEN: Ah, it all sounds too easy for my liking. 
HOBSON: Get the scanner lined up on the flight path between moon and Earth. Let me know the moment you spot anything. 
NILS: Right. 
HOBSON: All we have to do, Doctor, is to hold on here. 
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all. It doesn't depend on us, though. 
BEN: What do you mean? 
DOCTOR: It depends on what the Cybermen are hatching up. If a rocket is on it's way, they're bound to be aware of that already.

[Space ship]

CYBERLEADER: Emergency. Emergency. There is a spaceship approaching from Earth. It will arrive on the lunar surface in 15 minutes. Immediate offensive action must be taken.

[Lunar surface]

CYBERMAN: They have blocked up our way into the base. Other methods to gain entry will be tried.

[Space ship]

CYBERLEADER: The machine from Earth must first be destroyed. There are 14 minutes left. 
CYBERMAN [OC]: Understood.

[Lunar surface]

CYBERMAN: Transmit control signal. 
(A second cyberman operates a device, which emits a high-pitched whine.)

[Sickbay]

(The light above Evans' bed flashes and he sits up. He puts a cybercontrol device on his head and moves towards the attendant, no 6, Sam Becket, whom he hits over the head with an object he has picked up.)

[Lunar surface]

(The cyberman speaks into the control device.) 
CYBERMAN: You will listen to me and follow my instructions.

[Control room]

BENOIT: Switch on again. 
NILS: Without an aerial? 
BENOIT: We can pick up local signals. 
NILS: Local? Oh I see, the Cybermen. 
BENOIT: If they have any more words of cheer for us we might as well hear them. 
NILS: Right.

[Sickbay]

(Evans picks up a weapon.) 
CYBERMAN [OC]: Those are your orders.

[Control room]

(Ben is being taught how to operate a console.) 
BENOIT: That is correct, but watch the digital counter. 
BEN: Right. 
HOBSON: How's he shaping? 
BENOIT: Not bad for a beginner, I suppose, but it will take a long time yet. 
HOBSON: Well, at least the gravitron's stable at the moment. I don't know how they can take it for long in that room. 
BENOIT: How's Benson standing up to it? 
HOBSON: He's 
BENOIT: He's been on for 6 hours on the trot. 
HOBSON: He says he'll be all right for the time being. 
BENOIT: Yes I know, but should he be on it alone? 
HOBSON: Who else have we got? You're the only other operator who could replace him and you're needed right here. 
BENOIT: Well, it's a bit tough on him, isn't it? 
HOBSON: I know, Roger. It's tough on all of us but the lives of millions of people depend on this weather control unit. 
POLLY: Here we are. I've brought us all some coffee to keep us awake. 
BEN: Without sugar this time, I hope. 
POLLY: Of course. Don't remind me. 
HOBSON: Take some to the Doctor. He's in the dome. 
POLLY: Right. 
HOBSON: Ben. 
(Polly walks past Evans, who is wearing Sam's tabard and standing by the gravitron control door.)

[Gravitron control]

(Unnoticed, Evans goes into the room and knocks out Benson, then takes off the man's protective helmet.) 
CYBERMAN [OC]: You will now change field co-ordinates as instructed. 
(Evans puts the helmet on and sits down.)

[Control room]

BEN: Doctor! They've spotted it on the scanner. 
DOCTOR: What? 
BEN: The relief ship. 
POLLY: Ben, where? 
BEN: Over here. 
DOCTOR: Let's see. 
HOBSON: Well? 
NILS: No doubt about it. I told you they would be on their way. 
POLLY: That's a spaceship? 
BEN: No, that's the scanner. 
DOCTOR: It's not far off. 
HOBSON: Far off? It's coming in now off parking orbit. It'll be down in six minutes. 
POLLY: Well, don't you think you ought to warn them? 
BEN: Yeah, the Cybermen will be waiting for them. 
HOBSON: Don't worry, they've got their own warning system and weapons. They'll blast the Cybermen and their spaceship to kingdom come in about four minutes from now. 
(The radar blip moves to the centre of the screen.) 
POLLY: Come on, come on. It seems to move so slowly. 
(The blip carries on to the other side of the screen.) 
BENOIT: What are they doing? 
JAMIE: Looks like they've changed direction. 
HOBSON: They've changed into an escape orbit. Follow it. 
NILS: But it's going too fast. I can't keep up with it. 
HOBSON: Well, keep trying. 
NILS: I can't hold it. It's accelerating too fast. 
(The screen goes white.) 
BENOIT: Look out, man. You're on the sun. 
NILS: But that's where it's heading. 
BENOIT: The acceleration, it's gigantic! 
HOBSON: Get R/T contact with the ship. 
NILS: No good, sir. The Doppler effect. It's going too fast. 
BENOIT: They've had it, I'm afraid. 
HOBSON: The sun. 
BENOIT: Yes. 
POLLY: Will somebody please tell us what it all means? 
BENOIT: The rocket has been deflected towards the sun. Nothing can save them now. 
POLLY: Save them? What are you talking about? 
BENOIT: From plunging into the sun. 
BEN: But the sun's millions of miles away. 
BENOIT: Once they get into the sun's gravity belt they can't change course. It may take a week but they'll end up there just the same. 
HOBSON: What on earth could have caused it? 
BENOIT: The rocket was deflected off course, but why and how? 
DOCTOR: Deflected? Yes, of course. The gravitron. 
HOBSON: Have the Cybermen got a gravity weapon, do you think? 
DOCTOR: No, they haven't but we have. 
HOBSON: You're not suggesting that 
DOCTOR: There's only one way that rocket could have been deflected into the sun. From this very room! 
BENOIT: I see what you mean. 
HOBSON: Of course, the gravitron. Benson, he must 
BENOIT: I told you he'd been on duty too long. 
DOCTOR: If it is Benson. 
(They look through the gravitron control room. Evans turns around.) 
HOBSON: It's Evans! 
BEN: But he was in the medical room! 
DOCTOR: They must have got control of them again. 
BEN: And the other men in there? 
DOCTOR: They may not be affected yet. Get along to the medical room. Barricade the door with everything you can find. Keep them in there at all costs! 
JAMIE: Right.

[Sickbay]

(The other men are being activated. Number 10 and two others get up.)

[Outside Sickbay]

JAMIE: Well, that's all right. We haven't passed any of them. 
BEN: Well, maybe it was only Evans who's been reactivated. 
JAMIE: Aye. We'd better keep watch just here. 
BEN: We could stick that thing against the door 
JAMIE: It wouldn't hold them for long, I'm thinking. 
BEN: They're not Cybermen, mate. They're just flesh and blood like us. Come on, get hold of the other end. 
(They start to carry the metal table when Jamie drops his end.) 
BEN: Hey! 
JAMIE: Behind you! 
(A man starts to walk through the door.) 
BEN: Quick! Ram him! 
(Number ten get the thin metal rammed into his stomach. He falls back.) 
BEN: Press the locking button. 
JAMIE: It won't hold for long, will it. 
BEN: No. Look, get those chairs and we'll block 'em in. 
(The controlled men use a strip of metal to prise the doors apart.)

[Control room]

HOBSON: Evans, can you hear me? Listen, Evans, this is Hobson talking. Evans, you've got to concentrate. Your brain has been altered by the Cybermen. You're being controlled by them, anyhow. We've got one or two of those things as well, you know. You can't shoot all of us so why not be a good fellow and come out of there. 
BENOIT: What's he doing in there? Look at the field reactors. 
HOBSON: Huh? 
BENOIT: We must get back control soon. He could flood half of Europe if he keeps the gravitron aligned with spring tides. 
HOBSON: That settles it, we'll have to rush him. Get those weapons out. 
CYBERLEADER [OC]: Resistance is useless. All further ships from Earth will be deflected. Open the airlock to us. If you do not we shall destroy the base and you will be eliminated. 
HOBSON: Can you hear me? 
CYBERLEADER [OC]: Everything you have said in the past half hour has been overheard. 
HOBSON: Well you can hear this too, then. We're not done yet and we'll fight you to the last man. You'll never get inside this base. 
CYBERLEADER [OC]: We are in it already. 
(There's a bang and everyone clutches their throats and hangs on as the air rushes out.) 
HOBSON: They've punctured the dome! 
BENOIT: The oxygen masks! Quick everyone, take a mask. Over there. 
(Nils, Ben and Jamie get to a set of three masks in the ceiling. The Doctor has got one at the console Polly is hanging on to.)

[Observation dome]

(The dome is cracking.) 
BENOIT: I do hope we don't lose too much oxygen. 
HOBSON: Can we patch it, do you think? 
BENOIT: We can try. 
HOBSON: Give me a hand off, will you? 
(Benoit helps Hobson take off his lab coat.)

[Control room]

POLLY: Doctor, I can't breathe! 
(The Doctor tries to pass her a mask.) 
DOCTOR: Put this on your face.

[Observation dome]

(Hobson and Benoit plug the crack with the coat.) 
HOBSON: Oh, thank heavens. I can breath again. 
(The coat starts to get sucked through the hole.) 
BENOIT: Oh no! 
(The coat is sucked through the hole and flies across the moon.) 
HOBSON: Is there anything else we can patch it with? 
BENOIT: No, nothing. Wait. Over there. 
(It's the coffee tray.) 
HOBSON: Slide it to me but don't let go of it. We have to do it in one action. No second chance. Okay, ready? 
BENOIT: Oui. 
HOBSON: Now! 
(This firmly blocks the hole and the pressure gauges rise again.) 
HOBSON: Stopped them for the moment. 
BENOIT: I wonder for how long. 
HOBSON: Well, let's have a look.

[Control room]

DOCTOR: Polly! Are you all right? 
POLLY: Oh yes. Oh. Oh, where's that air coming from? 
NILS: Reserve tanks of oxygen. 
POLLY: Oh. Well why couldn't we have had those before? 
NILS: And lose all our oxygen? 
POLLY: Oh, I see. It's so quiet. 
DOCTOR: Yes, it is, isn't it. The gravitron's stopped! 
(Evans is slumped over the console.) 
DOCTOR: Quick, before he comes to! Ben, Jamie!

[Gravitron control room]

NILS: Joe! 
BEN: We've barricaded the sick bay with half the tables and chairs in the base but it won't hold forever, Doctor. 
(The Doctor takes the helmet and control piece off Evans.) 
DOCTOR: Well done, Ben. Here's another one for you. 
[Control room]

JAMIE: What do we do with him, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: That's your problem. Just make sure he doesn't come back here for a while. 
BEN: Blimey, I'll be after a job as a copper when I get back to 1966. 
(Ben and Jamie leave with Evans. The Doctor puts the control device inside his coat.)

[Observation dome]

DOCTOR: Mister Hobson, I've got an idea. 
HOBSON: Doctor, what do you make of this? 
DOCTOR: Made by a laser beam, I would think. 
HOBSON: Is there anything known to science the Cybermen haven't got? 
DOCTOR: Well they haven't got a gravitron or they wouldn't be after yours. 
HOBSON: We'll just have to stand guard in here with their cyberguns. 
BENOIT: Not much use, I'm afraid. They are getting reinforcements. 
HOBSON: What? 
BENOIT: Looks like another of their spaceships. 
DOCTOR: Oh yes, there. 
(A classic flying saucer lands.) 
HOBSON: Another one! 
(And a second.) 
CYBERLEADER [OC]: We have brought up reinforcements with other weapons. You have one chance. You must open the entry port. You cannot stop us now. You will all be completely destroyed. 
POLLY: What does he mean, other weapons? 
NILS: We'll soon find out. You stay here. I must report this to Mister Hobson. 
(Nils leaves Polly in charge of the R/T.)

[Lunar surface]

(Cybermen are unpacking crates.)

[Space ship]

CYBERLEADER: I shall count to ten. If you still stupidly remain silent. we shall fire. One

[Observation dome]

NILS: Hobby! They've got another weapon. They're going to 
HOBSON: Yes, I know. There it is. Everybody take cover. Get down, all of you! 
(The Doctor stays standing.) 
HOBSON: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Is the gravitron still switched on? 
HOBSON: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Then I shall certainly stay here.

[Lunar surface]

(A group of cybermen aim a weapon at the base.) 
CYBERLEADER [OC]: Nine, ten. Fire. 
(A beam goes towards the base then 'bounces' off it. For some reason, this cyberweapon has recoil. Don't ask. ) 
CYBERLEADER [OC]: Again. Fire. 
(Once again the beam bounces off the base.)

[Observation dome]

HOBSON: What happened? 
DOCTOR: It just deflected over the dome. 
(The Doctor sways.) 
BENOIT: Doctor, are you all right? 
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. 
HOBSON: The gravitron deflected it. The force field. 
DOCTOR: Yes, and that gives me an idea. What are they doing now? They're packing it away. 
HOBSON: What'll they cook up next, I wonder? 
DOCTOR: How far down can this be aimed? 
HOBSON: Down? 
DOCTOR: Can it be brought to bear on the surface of the moon? 
BENOIT: I see! 
HOBSON: Ah, well, I don't 
DOCTOR: Has it ever been tried? 
BENOIT: No, but we should try! 
DOCTOR: With Evans gone, the gravitron is all yours. 
BENOIT: Splendid! Je m'en occupe! 
HOBSON: It can only go to here. Any further down and the field may affect the base. 
DOCTOR: What does that matter now? 
HOBSON: Well, I suppose you're right. 
DOCTOR: Get someone to stand by that window and relay instructions direct to Benoit. 
HOBSON: Right. 
(Benoit puts on a helmet and goes into gravitron control. Polly is by the window to relay instructions. Thumbs up are sent.) 
HOBSON: He's ready. 
DOCTOR: Start moving the probe down. 
(The message is relayed. The approaching cybermen stop advancing and spread out. They draw their weapons. Benoit signals that the gravitron won't go any lower.) 
HOBSON: That's as far as it'll go. 
DOCTOR: What? But it's way over their heads. There's one chance. We'll try bringing it down by hand. 
HOBSON: Right. 
DOCTOR: Is this still switched off? 
HOBSON: Yes, it's off. 
DOCTOR: Round the back. 
HOBSON: It won't go. 
DOCTOR: All your weight, once more. No, it's no use, it won't shift. 
HOBSON: Ah, stupid of me. Of course it won't. 
DOCTOR: Why? 
HOBSON: Well, the angular cut out. It's obvious, isn't it. You see, there's got to be a safety cut out on the angle of the probe otherwise it might affect the whole base. There, that's done it. No, no, no, stand back. Benoit can do it now. 
DOCTOR: Polly! 
HOBSON: Switch on! 
(As the gravitron comes down to level with the moon's surface, the cybermen start to float up and away, followed by their saucers. Big cheers from the assembled team.) 
DOCTOR: We did it! 
HOBSON: Well, that's taken care of the Cybermen. Now then, everybody, we've got to get this gravitron in operation again as fast as we can. 
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry we damaged it. 
HOBSON: What? Oh, yes.

[Control room]

HOBSON: Nils, rig up a temporary aerial. Call up Space Control. Tell Rinberg we will be operational in er, oh about two hours. He won't like it but it's the best we can do. 
NILS: Right. 
HOBSON: Two hours, that's all we've got to get the world's weather back under control again. Benoit, take charge of your side. 
(Meanwhile, the Doctor, Ben, Polly and Jamie quietly leave.) 
BENOIT: Right. 
HOBSON: And Doctor, what the? Oh well, perhaps it's just as well. We've got enough madmen here already. Now come on, I want to see your first weather plot in two minutes. 
BENOIT: Right, come on boys.

[Lunar surface]

(Safely suited up, the travellers take a last at the Moonbase before approaching the Tardis doors.) 
POLLY: Doctor, look. 
(A comet-like object is streaking through space.) 
POLLY: Could that be them? 
DOCTOR: Possibly. And I hope it's the last we see of them. 
(They all enter the Tardis and it dematerialises.)

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: There we are. In perfect flight. 
POLLY: Yes, and look what happened last time. 
DOCTOR: Oh, that. What a lot of fuss. Just a bumpy landing, that's all. It won't happen again. I know. 
BEN: What are you up to now? 
DOCTOR: Let's have a look at the time scanner. 
POLLY: The what? 
DOCTOR: The time scanner. Instead of the normal picture showing where we are, it gives you a glimpse of the future. 
JAMIE: The second sight? Very dangerous. 
DOCTOR: Oh nonsense. I haven't used it very much. It's (cough) not very reliable, as you can see. 
POLLY: Doctor. 
DOCTOR: Hmm? 
POLLY: Look! 
(The scanner shows an image of a giant claw.)

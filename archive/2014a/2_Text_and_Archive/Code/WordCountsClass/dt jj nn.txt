Some years agonever mind how long preciselyhaving little or no money in my purse and nothing particular to interest me on shore I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world
If they but knew it almost all men in their degree some time or other cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me
Its extreme downtown is the battery where that noble mole is washed by waves and cooled by breezes which a few hours previous were out of sight of land
Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon
Are the green fields gone
Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice
Tell me does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither
Say you are in the country in some high land of lakes
Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert try this experiment if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor
What is the chief element he employs
There stand his trees each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a crucifix were within and here sleeps his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke
Why did the poor poet of Tennessee upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach
Why upon your first voyage as a passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land
Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy
Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity and own brother of Jove
Besides passengers get seasickgrow quarrelsomedont sleep of nightsdo not enjoy themselves much as a general thingno I never go as a passenger nor though I am something of a salt do I ever go to sea as a Commodore or a Captain or a Cook
It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids
No when I go to sea I go as a simple sailor right before the mast plumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal masthead
The transition is a keen one I assure you from a schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it
What of it if some old hunks of a seacaptain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks
What does that indignity amount to weighed I mean in the scales of the New Testament
Again I always go to sea as a sailor because they make a point of paying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of
The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven
Finally I always go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck
For as in this world head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern that is if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim so for the most part the Commodore on the quarterdeck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle
In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things at the same time that the leaders little suspect it
But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage this the invisible police officer of the Fates who has the constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and influences me in some unaccountable wayhe can better answer than any one else
And doubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago
Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself
By reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome the great floodgates of the wonderworld swung open and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into my inmost soul endless processions of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air
Quitting the good city of old Manhatto I duly arrived in New Bedford
Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reaching that place would offer till the following Monday
Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen the RedMen first sally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan
It was a very dubiouslooking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold and cheerless
Too expensive and jolly again thought I pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within
At this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proved all but deserted
But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood invitingly open
However I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within pushed on and opened a second interior door
A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit
Moving on I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray and these words underneathThe Spouter InnPeter Coffin
CoffinSpouterRather ominous in that particular connexion thought I But it is a common name in Nantucket they say and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there
As the light looked so dim and the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district and as the swinging sign had a povertystricken sort of creak to it I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings and the best of pea coffee
It was a queer sort of placea gableended old house one side palsied as it were and leaning over sadly
What a pity they didnt stop up the chinks and the crannies though and thrust in a little lint here and there
Poor Lazarus there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings he might plug up both ears with rags and put a corncob into his mouth and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon
Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator yea ye gods go down to the fiery pit itself in order to keep out this frost
Yet Dives himself he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being a president of a temperance society he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans
On one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of the neighbors that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose
Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the New England hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched
But by dint of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however wild might not be altogether unwarranted
But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long limber portentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue dim perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast
A boggy soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted
Ever and anon a bright but alas deceptive idea would dart you throughIts the Black Sea in a midnight galeIts the unnatural combat of the four primal elementsIts a blasted heathIts a Hyperborean winter sceneIts the breakingup of the icebound stream of Time
But stop does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish even the great leviathan himself
In fact the artists design seemed this a final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the subject
The picture represents a CapeHorner in a great hurricane the halffoundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mastheads
The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears
The original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man travelled full forty feet and at last was found imbedded in the hump
Crossing this dusky entry and on through yon lowarched waycut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all roundyou enter the public room
A still duskier place is this with such low ponderous beams above and such old wrinkled planks beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old crafts cockpits especially of such a howling night when this corneranchored old ark rocked so furiously
On one side stood a long low shelflike table covered with cracked glass cases filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide worlds remotest nooks
Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a darklooking denthe bara rude attempt at a right whales head
Fill to THIS mark and your charge is but a penny to THIS a penny more and so on to the full glassthe Cape Horn measure which you may gulp down for a shilling
Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a table examining by a dim light divers specimens of SKRIMSHANDER
I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed that if I should ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night I would put up with the half of any decent mans blanket
One young fellow in a green box coat addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner
My boy said the landlord youll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty
I seed her reported in the offing this morning a three years voyage and a full ship
No wonder then that they made a straight wake for the whales mouththe barwhen the wrinkled little old Jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round
One complained of a bad cold in his head upon which Jonah mixed him a pitchlike potion of gin and molasses which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast of Labrador or on the weather side of an iceisland
This man interested me at once and since the seagods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a sleepingpartner one so far as this narrative is concerned I will here venture upon a little description of him
His face was deeply brown and burnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy
His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner and from his fine stature I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia
In a few minutes however he was missed by his shipmates and being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with them they raised a cry of Bulkington
It was now about nine oclock and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen
And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objections indefinitely multiply
The shavings flew right and left till at last the planeiron came bump against an indestructible knot
So gathering up the shavings with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a brown study
But it was a foot too narrow and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed oneso there was no yoking them
But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night
It seemed no bad idea but upon second thoughts I dismissed it
For who could tell but what the next morning so soon as I popped out of the room the harpooneer might be standing in the entry all ready to knock me down
Still looking round me again and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other persons bed I began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer
But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos and threes and going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer
Cant sell his headWhat sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me getting into a towering rage
Ill break it for him said I now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlords
Sartain and thats the very reason he cant sell it I guess
I come to your house and want a bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer
And about this harpooneer whom I have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellowa sort of connexion landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree
And in the first place you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head which if true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and Ive no idea of sleeping with a madman and you sir YOU I mean landlord YOU sir by trying to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution
Wall said the landlord fetching a long breath thats a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then
This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling mebut at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators
Depend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man
I considered the matter a moment and then up stairs we went and I was ushered into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast
I then glanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four walls and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale
Of things not properly belonging to the room there was a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large seamans bag containing the harpooneers wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk
Likewise there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fireplace and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed
I took it up and held it close to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it
I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin
But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise
I put it on to try it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and thick and I thought a little damp as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day
Whether that mattress was stuffed with corncobs or broken crockery there is no telling but I rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time
At last I slid off into a light doze and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door
Lord save me thinks I that must be the harpooneer the infernal headpeddler
Holding a light in one hand and that identical New Zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room
Yes its just as I thought hes a terrible bedfellow hes been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he is just from the surgeon
But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light that I plainly saw they could not be stickingplasters at all those black squares on his cheeks
I remembered a story of a white mana whaleman toowho falling among the cannibals had been tattooed by them
I concluded that this harpooneer in the course of his distant voyages must have met with a similar adventure
To be sure it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but I never heard of a hot suns tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one
However I had never been in the South Seas and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin
Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room he then took the New Zealand heada ghastly thing enoughand crammed it down into the bag
He now took off his hata new beaver hatwhen I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise
There was no hair on his headnone to speak of at leastnothing but a small scalpknot twisted up on his forehead
In fact I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him
As I live these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face his back too was all over the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years War and just escaped from it with a stickingplaster shirt
It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas and so landed in this Christian country
Remembering the embalmed head at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner
But seeing that it was not at all limber and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be
For now the savage goes up to the empty fireplace and removing the papered fireboard sets up this little hunchbacked image like a tenpin between the andirons
First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket and places them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze
Presently after many hasty snatches into the fire and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit then blowing off the heat and ashes a little he made a polite offer of it to the little negro
But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lips
All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee who seemed to be praying in a singsong or else singing some pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner
At last extinguishing the fire he took the idol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock
All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations and jumping into bed with me I thought it was high time now or never before the light was put out to break the spell in which I had so long been bound
But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say was a fatal one
The next moment the light was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth sprang into bed with me
Speake tellee me whoee be or damme I kille again growled the cannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire
Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian
But there was no help for it so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets
I felt worse and worseat last I got up dressed and softly going down in my stockinged feet sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself at her feet beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time
At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly waking from ithalf steeped in dreamsI opened my eyes and the before sunlit room was now wrapped in outer darkness
Instantly I felt a shock running through all my frame nothing was to be seen and nothing was to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine
Nay to this very hour I often puzzle myself with it
Now take away the awful fear and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequegs pagan arm thrown round me
But at length all the past nights events soberly recurred one by one in fixed reality and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament
I then rolled over my neck feeling as if it were in a horsecollar and suddenly felt a slight scratch
A pretty pickle truly thought I abed here in a strange house in the broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk
Meanwhile I lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgivings now and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature
When at last his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow and he became as it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out upon the floor and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that if it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself
Thinks I Queequeg under the circumstances this is a very civilized overture but the truth is these savages have an innate sense of delicacy say what you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are
I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg because he treated me with so much civility and consideration while I was guilty of great rudeness staring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motions for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding
If he had not been a small degree civilized he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all but then if he had not been still a savage he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on
However a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a good thing the mores the pity
So if any one man in his own proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way
This young fellows healthy cheek is like a suntoasted pear in hue and would seem to smell almost as musky he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage
That man next him looks a few shades lighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him
But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart of Africa which was the sum of poor Mungos performancesthis kind of travel I say may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish
Still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had anywhere
These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table and I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence
A curious sight these bashful bears these timid warrior whalemen
His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it there without ceremony reaching over the table with it to the imminent jeopardy of many heads and grappling the beefsteaks towards him
Enough that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room lighted his tomahawkpipe and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when I sallied out for a stroll
If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford
In thoroughfares nigh the docks any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts
But besides the Feegeeans Tongatobooarrs Erromanggoans Pannangians and Brighggians and besides the wild specimens of the whalingcraft which unheeded reel about the streets you will see other sights still more curious certainly more comical
Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came
In some things you would think them but a few hours old
No townbred dandy will compare with a countrybred oneI mean a downright bumpkin dandya fellow that in the dogdays will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands
Now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation and joins the great whalefishery you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport
But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers cannibals and bumpkins to show her visitors
Still New Bedford is a queer place
The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in in all New England
Whence came they how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country
Yes all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic Pacific and Indian oceans
In New Bedford fathers they say give whales for dowers to their daughters and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises apiece
You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding for they say they have reservoirs of oil in every house and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles
But roses only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens
Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs ye cannot save in Salem where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands
In this same New Bedford there stands a Whalemans Chapel and few are the moody fishermen shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot
Returning from my first morning stroll I again sallied out upon this special errand
Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin I fought my way against the stubborn storm
A muffled silence reigned only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm
Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable
The chaplain had not yet arrived and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets with black borders masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY Who in the bows of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan AUGUST 3d 1833
This savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance because he was the only one who could not read and therefore was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall
Oh ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass who standing among flowers can sayhere HERE lies my beloved ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these
What despair in those immovable inscriptions
But Faith like a jackal feeds among the tombs and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope
It needs scarcely to be told with what feelings on the eve of a Nantucket voyage I regarded those marble tablets and by the murky light of that darkened doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me
Yes Ishmael the same fate may be thine
I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered immediately as the stormpelted door flew back upon admitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain
Yes it was the famous Father Mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he was a very great favourite
At the time I now write of Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth for among all the fissures of his wrinkles there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloomthe spring verdure peeping forth even beneath Februarys snow
No one having previously heard his history could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led
However hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner when arrayed in a decent suit he quietly approached the pulpit
The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted manropes for this ladder which being itself nicely headed and stained with a mahogany colour the whole contrivance considering what manner of chapel it was seemed by no means in bad taste
Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the manropes Father Mapple cast a look upwards and then with a truly sailorlike but still reverential dexterity hand over hand mounted the steps as if ascending the maintop of his vessel
The perpendicular parts of this side ladder as is usually the case with swinging ones were of clothcovered rope only the rounds were of wood so that at every step there was a joint
At my first glimpse of the pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary
Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage
No thought I there must be some sober reason for this thing furthermore it must symbolize something unseen
Yes for replenished with the meat and wine of the word to the faithful man of God this pulpit I see is a selfcontaining strongholda lofty Ehrenbreitstein with a perennial well of water within the walls
Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers
But high above the flying scud and darkrolling clouds there floated a little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angels face and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ships tossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted into the Victorys plank where Nelson fell
Ah noble ship the angel seemed to say beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy helm for lo the sun is breaking through the clouds are rolling offserenest azure is at hand
Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same seataste that had achieved the ladder and the picture
Father Mapple rose and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense
There was a low rumbling of heavy seaboots among the benches and a still slighter shuffling of womens shoes and all was quiet again and every eye on the preacher
With speed he flew to my relief As on a radiant dolphin borne Awful yet bright as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God
Yet what depths of the soul does Jonahs deep sealine sound what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet
What a noble thing is that canticle in the fishs belly
As sinful men it is a lesson to us all because it is a story of the sin hardheartedness suddenly awakened fears the swift punishment repentance prayers and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah
As with all sinners among men the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of Godnever mind now what that command was or how conveyedwhich he found a hard command
By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz
Cadiz is in Spain as far by water from Joppa as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea
Because Joppa the modern Jaffa shipmates is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean the Syrian and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that just outside the Straits of Gibraltar
Oh most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with slouched hat and guilty eye skulking from his God prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas
So disordered selfcondemning is his look that had there been policemen in those days Jonah on the mere suspicion of something wrong had been arrested ere he touched a deck
At last after much dodging search he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods to mark the strangers evil eye
Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah though the man now stands before him but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing glance
No sooner sirSoon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger
He charges him thrice the usual sum and its assented to
Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold
All dressed and dusty as he is Jonah throws himself into his berth and finds the little stateroom ceiling almost resting on his forehead
But the sea rebels he will not bear the wicked burden
A dreadful storm comes on the ship is like to break
He sees no black sky and raging sea feels not the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him
Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat
And ever as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep
The sailors mark him more and more certain grow their suspicions of him and at last fully to test the truth by referring the whole matter to high Heaven they fall to casting lots to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them
The eager mariners but ask him who he is and where from whereas they not only receive an answer to those questions but likewise another answer to a question not put by them but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him I am a Hebrew he criesand thenI fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land
Straightway he now goes on to make a full confession whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled but still are pitiful
For when Jonah not yet supplicating God for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his desertswhen wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea for he knew that for HIS sake this great tempest was upon them they mercifully turn from him and seek by other means to save the ship
But all in vain the indignant gale howls louder then with one hand raised invokingly to God with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah
But observe his prayer and learn a weighty lesson
And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale
His deep chest heaved as with a groundswell his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them
How being an anointed pilotprophet or speaker of true things and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh Jonah appalled at the hostility he should raise fled from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa
As we have seen God came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom and with swift slantings tore him along into the midst of the seas where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down and the weeds were wrapped about his head and all the watery world of woe bowled over him
Yea woe to him who as the great Pilot Paul has it while preaching to others is himself a castaway
He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment then lifting his face to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasmBut oh shipmates on the starboard hand of every woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight than the bottom of the woe is deep
Delight is to hima far far upward and inward delightwho against the proud gods and commodores of this earth ever stands forth his own inexorable self
Delight is to him whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages
But being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon going to the table took up a large book there and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth pageas I fanciedstopping a moment looking vacantly around him and giving utterance to a longdrawn gurgling whistle of astonishment
He would then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence at number one each time as though he could not count more than fifty and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited
It may seem ridiculous but it reminded me of General Washingtons head as seen in the popular busts of him
Whilst I was thus closely scanning him halfpretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement he never heeded my presence never troubled himself with so much as a single glance but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book
Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning I thought this indifference of his very strange
I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all or but very little with the other seamen in the inn
Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home by the way of Cape Horn that iswhich was the only way he could get therethrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter and yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving the utmost serenity content with his own companionship always equal to himself
There he sat his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits
Wild he was a very sight of sights to see yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him
And those same things that would have repelled most others they were the very magnets that thus drew me
Ill try a pagan friend thought I since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy
We then turned over the book together and I endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it
Thus I soon engaged his interest and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town
Soon I proposed a social smoke and producing his pouch and tomahawk he quietly offered me a puff
In a countryman this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply
After supper and another social chat and smoke we went to our room together
I was a good Christian born and bred in the bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church
How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood
But what is worship thought I Do you suppose now Ishmael that the magnanimous God of heaven and earthpagans and all includedcan possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood
But we did not go to sleep without some little chat
Man and wife they say there open the very bottom of their souls to each other and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning
The more so I say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some small part of you must be cold for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast
If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable and have been so a long time then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more
But if like Queequeg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled why then indeed in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm
For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich
For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air
Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences though light be more congenial to our clayey part
Upon opening my eyes then and coming out of my own pleasant and selfcreated darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelveoclockatnight I experienced a disagreeable revulsion
Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light seeing that we were so wide awake and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk
Be it said that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them
I was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend
Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes I know not but he now spoke of his native island and eager to hear his history I begged him to go on and tell it
Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words yet subsequent disclosures when I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give
When a newhatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout followed by the nibbling goats as if he were a green sapling even then in Queequegs ambitious soul lurked a strong desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two
His father was a High Chief a King his uncle a High Priest and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors
There was excellent blood in his veinsroyal stuff though sadly vitiated I fear by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth
Alone in his canoe he paddled off to a distant strait which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island
On one side was a coral reef on the other a low tongue of land covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water
But like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen
For at bottomso he told mehe was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were and more than that still better than they were
Thought he its a wicked world in all meridians Ill die a pagan
And thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these Christians wore their clothes and tried to talk their gibberish
Hence the queer ways about him though now some time from home
By hints I asked him whether he did not propose going back and having a coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone he being very old and feeble at the last accounts
Upon this I told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from
He at once resolved to accompany me to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into the same watch the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my every hap with both my hands in his boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds
The grinning landlord as well as the boarders seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequegespecially as Peter Coffins cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now companied with
We borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including my own poor carpetbag and Queequegs canvas sack and hammock away we went down to the Moss the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf
I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons
To this in substance he replied that though what I hinted was true enough yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it was of assured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales
Shifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen
Not to seem ignorant about the thingthough in truth he was entirely so concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrowQueequeg puts his chest upon it lashes it fast and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf
The people of his island of Rokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held
Well when all the wedding guests were assembled at the brides bamboo cottage this Captain marches in and being assigned the post of honour placed himself over against the punchbowl and between the High Priest and his majesty the King Queequegs father
Seeing himself placed next the Priest and noting the ceremony and thinking himselfbeing Captain of a shipas having plain precedence over a mere island King especially in the Kings own housethe Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowltaking it I suppose for a huge fingerglass
Gaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt his snortings
At the same foamfountain Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me
So full of this reeling scene were we as we stood by the plunging bowsprit that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers a lubberlike assembly who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro
Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back
Hallo you sir cried the Captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalking up to Queequeg what in thunder do you mean by that
The prodigious strain upon the mainsail had parted the weathersheet and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck
The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly was swept overboard all hands were in a panic and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it seemed madness
Nothing was done and nothing seemed capable of being done those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale
In the midst of this consternation Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees and crawling under the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope secured one end to the bulwarks and then flinging the other like a lasso caught it round the boom as it swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar was that way trapped and all was safe
The schooner was run into the wind and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat Queequeg stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap
A few minutes more and he rose again one arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form
The poor bumpkin was restored
All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump the captain begged his pardon
See what a real corner of the world it occupies how it stands there away off shore more lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse
Look at ita mere hillock and elbow of sand all beach without a background
In olden times an eagle swooped down upon the New England coast and carried off an infant Indian in his talons
With loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters
They resolved to follow in the same direction
Setting out in their canoes after a perilous passage they discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory casketthe poor little Indians skeleton
And thus have these naked Nantucketers these sea hermits issuing from their anthill in the sea overrun and conquered the watery world like so many Alexanders parcelling out among them the Atlantic Pacific and Indian oceans as the three pirate powers did Poland
It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor and Queequeg and I went ashore so we could attend to no business that day at least none but a supper and a bed
However by dint of beating about a little in the dark and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way we at last came to something which there was no mistaking
Two enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by asses ears swung from the crosstrees of an old topmast planted in front of an old doorway
The horns of the crosstrees were sawed off on the other side so that this old topmast looked not a little like a gallows
Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving
I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn under a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured eye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt
Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed Mrs Hussey postponing further scolding for the present ushered us into a little room and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast turned round to us and saidClam or Cod
A clam for supper a cold clam is THAT what you mean Mrs Hussey says I but thats a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time aint it Mrs Hussey
But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hear nothing but the word clam Mrs Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen and bawling out clam for two disappeared
Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage and in particular Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him and the chowder being surpassingly excellent we despatched it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs Husseys clam and cod announcement I thought I would try a little experiment
In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again but with a different flavor and in good time a fine codchowder was placed before us
Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots which well deserved its name for the pots there were always boiling chowders
There was a fishy flavor to the milk too which I could not at all account for till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermens boats I saw Hoseas brindled cow feeding on fish remnants and marching along the sand with each foot in a cods decapitated head looking very slipshod I assure ye
Why not said I every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoonbut why not
So Mr Queequeg for she had learned his name I will just take this here iron and keep it for you till morning
DEVILDAM I do not know the origin of TITBIT is obvious PEQUOD you will no doubt remember was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians now extinct as the ancient Medes
I peered and pryed about the Devildam from her hopped over to the Titbit and finally going on board the Pequod looked around her for a moment and then decided that this was the very ship for us
You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught I knowsquaretoed luggers mountainous Japanese junks butterbox galliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod
She was a ship of the old school rather small if anything with an oldfashioned clawfooted look about her
Long seasoned and weatherstained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans her old hulls complexion was darkened like a French grenadiers who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia
But to all these her old antiquities were added new and marvellous features pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed
She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory
A noble craft but somehow a most melancholy
All noble things are touched with that
Now when I looked about the quarterdeck for some one having authority in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage at first I saw nobody but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent or rather wigwam pitched a little behind the mainmast
It seemed only a temporary erection used in port
It was of a conical shape some ten feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the rightwhale
Planted with their broad ends on the deck a circle of these slabs laced together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex united in a tufted point where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the topknot on some old Pottowottamie Sachems head
A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship so that the insider commanded a complete view forward
And half concealed in this queer tenement I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and the ships work suspended was now enjoying respite from the burden of command
He was seated on an oldfashioned oaken chair wriggling all over with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed
I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes this old seaman as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer was full of his insular prejudices and rather distrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard
I was a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said as calmly as I could What you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident
For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request not knowing exactly how to take it whether humorously or in earnest
Going forward and glancing over the weather bow I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the floodtide was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean
It turned out to be Captain Bildad who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel the other shares as is sometimes the case in these ports being held by a crowd of old annuitants widows fatherless children and chancery wards each owning about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail or two in the ship
People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest
Now Bildad like Peleg and indeed many other Nantucketers was a Quaker the island having been originally settled by that sect and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous
For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whalehunters
For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness
Be sure of this O young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease
How now in the contemplative evening of his days the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence I do not know but it did not seem to concern him much and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a mans religion is one thing and this practical world quite another
They told me in Nantucket though it certainly seems a curious story that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman his crew upon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and worn out
For a pious man especially for a Quaker he was certainly rather hardhearted to say the least
He never used to swear though at his men they said but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them
His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character
On his long gaunt body he carried no spare flesh no superfluous beard his chin having a soft economical nap to it like the worn nap of his broadbrimmed hat
His broadbrim was placed beside him his legs were stiffly crossed his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin and spectacles on nose he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume
Ye have been studying those Scriptures now for the last thirty years to my certain knowledge
Dost thee said Bildad in a hollow tone and turning round to me
Peleg now threw open a chest and drawing forth the ships articles placed pen and ink before him and seated himself at a little table
I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages but all hands including the captain received certain shares of the profits called lays and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ships company
I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling my own lay would not be very large but considering that I was used to the sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th laythat is the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage whatever that might eventually amount to
And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather LONG LAY yet it was better than nothing and if we had a lucky voyage might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it not to speak of my three years beef and board for which I would not have to pay one stiver
It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortuneand so it was a very poor way indeed
But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud
Upon the whole I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th considering I was of a broadshouldered make
Why blast your eyes Bildad cried Peleg thou dost not want to swindle this young man he must have more than that
Bildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him said Captain Peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this shipwidows and orphans many of themand that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans
Captain Peleg said Bildad steadily thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water or ten fathoms I cant tell but as thou art still an impenitent man Captain Peleg I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit Captain Peleg
Its an allfired outrage to tell any human creature that hes bound to hell
Out of the cabin ye canting drabcoloured son of a wooden guna straight wake with ye
Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad who I made no doubt was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg
And after signing the papers off I went nothing doubting but that I had done a good mornings work and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape
Hes a queer man Captain Ahabso some thinkbut a good one
And yet the old squaw Tistig at Gayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic
I know Captain Ahab well Ive sailed with him as mate years ago I know what he isa good mannot a pious good man like Bildad but a swearing good mansomething like meonly theres a good deal more of him
So goodbye to theeand wrong not Captain Ahab because he happens to have a wicked name
And somehow at the time I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for I dont know what unless it was the cruel loss of his leg
And yet I also felt a strange awe of him but that sort of awe which I cannot at all describe was not exactly awe I do not know what it was
I looked through the keyhole but the door opening into an odd corner of the room the keyhole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one
I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequegs harpoon which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him before our mounting to the chamber
Thats strange thought I but at any rate since the harpoon stands yonder and he seldom or never goes abroad without it therefore he must be inside here and no possible mistake
Run for Gods sake and fetch something to pry open the doorthe axethe axe hes had a stroke depend upon itand so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs again emptyhanded when Mrs Hussey interposed the mustardpot and vinegarcruet and the entire castor of her countenance
In as calm but rapid a manner as possible I gave her to understand the whole case
Running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs she glanced in and returning told me that Queequegs harpoon was missing
Has the poor lad a sister
But avast putting her hand in her sidepocket heres a key thatll fit I guess lets see
With a prodigious noise the door flew open and the knob slamming against the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling and there good heavens there sat Queequeg altogether cool and selfcollected right in the middle of the room squatting on his hams and holding Yojo on top of his head
He looked neither one way nor the other way but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life
Mrs Hussey said I hes ALIVE at all events so leave us if you please and I will see to this strange affair myself
There he sat and all he could dofor all my polite arts and blandishmentshe would not move a peg nor say a single word nor even look at me nor notice my presence in the slightest way
I began to grow vexed with him it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room holding a piece of wood on his head
Think of it sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary unaccountable Ramadan
Now as I before hinted I have no objection to any persons religion be it what it may so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person because that other person dont believe it also
But when a mans religion becomes really frantic when it is a positive torment to him and in fine makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him
I told him too that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage it pained me very badly pained me to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his
In one word Queequeg said I rather digressively hell is an idea first born on an undigested appledumpling and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans
It was after a great feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two oclock in the afternoon and all cooked and eaten that very evening
Because in the first place he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject unless considered from his own point of view and in the second place he did not more than one third understand me couch my ideas simply as I would and finally he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did
He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety
Do tell now cried Bildad is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomys meeting
I mean sir the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I and Captain Peleg there and Queequeg here and all of us and every mothers son and soul of us belong the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world we all belong to that only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief in THAT we all join hands
By the great anchor what a harpoon hes got there looks like good stuff that and he handles it about right
Without saying a word Queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whaleboats hanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising his harpoon cried out in some such way as this Capain you see him small drop tar on water dere
So down we went into the cabin and to my great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ships company to which I myself belonged
Spurn the idol Bell and the hideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind thine eye I say oh goodness gracious steer clear of the fiery pit
Peleg said Bildad lifting his eyes and hands thou thyself as I myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowest Peleg what it is to have the fear of death how then canst thou prate in this ungodly guise
Tell me when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab didst thou not think of Death and the Judgment then
He was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck
A souls a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon
What are you jabbering about shipmate said I HES got enough though to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps abruptly said the stranger placing a nervous emphasis upon the word HE
Whos Old Thunder said I again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner
They didnt tell much of anything about him only Ive heard that hes a good whalehunter and a good captain to his crew
With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod the beggarlike stranger stood a moment as if in a troubled reverie then starting a little turned and saidYeve shipped have ye
Anyhow its all fixed and arranged aready and some sailors or other must go with him I suppose as well these as any other men God pity em
Morning to ye shipmates morning the ineffable heavens bless ye Im sorry I stopped ye
Morning it is said I Come along Queequeg lets leave this crazy man
Somehow the sight of him struck me so that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind but passed on with my comrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did
I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really dogging us or not and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg and on that side of it retraced our steps
Not only were the old sails being mended but new sails were coming on board and bolts of canvas and coils of rigging in short everything betokened that the ships preparations were hurrying to a close
Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp lookout upon the hands Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after nightfall
Just so with whaling which necessitates a threeyears housekeeping upon the wide ocean far from all grocers costermongers doctors bakers and bankers
And though this also holds true of merchant vessels yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen
Hence the spare boats spare spars and spare lines and harpoons and spare everythings almost but a spare Captain and duplicate ship
At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the stewards pantry another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mates desk where he kept his log a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some ones rheumatic back
And like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety comfort and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was concerned and in which she herself owned a score or two of wellsaved dollars
But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on board as she did the last day with a long oilladle in one hand and a still longer whaling lance in the other
As for Bildad he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed and at every fresh arrival down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper
If I had been downright honest with myself I would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea
Avast cried a voice whose owner at the same time coming close behind us laid a hand upon both our shoulders and then insinuating himself between us stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain twilight strangely peering from Queequeg to me
Holloa cried stationary Elijah hailing us when we had removed a few paces
Struck by this plain matteroffact question I answered saying Yes I thought I did see four or five men but it was too dim to be sure
Shant see ye again very soon I guess unless its before the Grand Jury
And with these cracked words he finally departed leaving me for the moment in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence
Seeing a light we went down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in a tattered peajacket
He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawkpipe which it seemed had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger
The strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole it began to tell upon him
I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab when we heard a noise on deck
Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarterdeck just as if they were to be jointcommanders at sea as well as to all appearances in port
And all this seemed natural enough especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the cabin table having a farewell merrymaking with their shore friends before they quit the ship for good with the pilot
Strike the tent therewas the next order
As I hinted before this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on board the Pequod for thirty years the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor
Blood and thunderjumpwas the next command and the crew sprang for the handspikes
Now in getting under weigh the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship
Nevertheless not three days previous Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod particularly in getting under weigh and Charity his sister had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seamans berth
Meantime overseeing the other part of the ship Captain Peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner
Quohog spring thou chap with the red whiskers spring there Scotchcap spring thou green pants
It was a short cold Christmas and as the short northern day merged into night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose freezing spray cased us in ice as in polished armor
The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant vast curving icicles depended from the bows
Lank Bildad as pilot headed the first watch and ever and anon as the old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the shivering frost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his steady notes were heard Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood Stand dressed in living green
Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then
Spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous Atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket there was yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store and meads and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the spring untrodden unwilted remains at midsummer
The stout sailboat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside
And he too did not a little run from cabin to decknow a word below and now a word with Starbuck the chief mate
But at last he turned to his comrade with a final sort of look about himCaptain Bildadcome old shipmate we must go
Luck to ye Starbuckluck to ye Mr Stubbluck to ye Mr Flaskgoodbye and good luck to ye alland this day three years Ill have a hot supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket
I hope yell have fine weather now so that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among yea pleasant sun is all he needs and yell have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go
Oh the sailneedles are in the green locker
Dont whale it too much a Lords days men but dont miss a fair chance either thats rejecting Heavens good gifts
Ship and boat diverged the cold damp night breeze blew between a screaming gull flew overhead the two hulls wildly rolled we gave three heavyhearted cheers and blindly plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic
I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man who in midwinter just landed from a four years dangerous voyage could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term
With all her might she crowds all sail off shore in so doing fights gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward seeks all the lashed seas landlessness again for refuges sake forlornly rushing into peril her only friend her bitterest foe
Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish shore
In the first place it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact that among people at large the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions
If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits were he presented to the company as a harpooneer say and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials SWF
But butchers also and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honour
And as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the sperm whaleship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth
And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldiers profession let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whales vast tail fanning into eddies the air over his head
I freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot for his life point out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world taken in one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling
Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn no commerce but colonial scarcely any intercourse but colonial was carried on between Europe and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast
It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish crown touching those colonies and if space permitted it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru Chili and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts
That great America on the other side of the sphere Australia was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman
After its first blunderborn discovery by a Dutchman all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous but the whaleship touched there
The whaleship is the true mother of that now mighty colony
Moreover in the infancy of the first Australian settlement the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whaleship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters
The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth and do commercial homage to the whaleship that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations
The whale has no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler you will say
THE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER
True enough but then whalemen themselves are poor devils they have no good blood in their veins
NO GOOD BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS
The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel afterwards by marriage Mary Folger one of the old settlers of Nantucket and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and harpooneersall kith and kin to noble Benjaminthis day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other
By old English statutory law the whale is declared a royal fish Oh thats only nominal
In one of the mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the worlds capital the bones of a whale brought all the way from the Syrian coast were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession See subsequent chapters for something more on this head
Grant it since you cite it but say what you will there is no real dignity in whaling
The dignity of our calling the very heavens attest
Much might be ruminated here concerning the essential dignity of this regal process because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair and palpably smells of that anointing
In truth a mature man who uses hairoil unless medicinally that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere
As a general rule he cant amount to much in his totality
The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck a native of Nantucket and a Quaker by descent
He was a long earnest man and though born on an icy coast seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes his flesh being hard as twicebaked biscuit
He must have been born in some time of general drought and famine or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous
A staid steadfast man whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action and not a tame chapter of sounds
By this he seemed to mean not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward
But we shall ere long see what that word careful precisely means when used by a man like Stubb or almost any other whale hunter
Besides he thought perhaps that in this business of whaling courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishly wasted
For thought Starbuck I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living and not to be killed by them for theirs and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew
Where in the bottomless deeps could he find the torn limbs of his brother
With memories like these in him and moreover given to a certain superstitiousness as has been said the courage of this Starbuck which could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have been extreme
But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the complete abasement of poor Starbucks fortitude scarce might I have the heart to write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to expose the fall of valour in the soul
Men may seem detestable as joint stockcompanies and nations knaves fools and murderers there may be men may have mean and meagre faces but man in the ideal is so noble and so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes
That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves so far within us that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valorruined man
Nor can piety itself at such a shameful sight completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars
But this august dignity I treat of is not the dignity of kings and robes but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture
The great God absolute
Bear me out in it thou great democratic God who didst not refuse to the swart convict Bunyan the pale poetic pearl Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles who didst hurl him upon a warhorse who didst thunder him higher than a throne
A happygolucky neither craven nor valiant taking perils as they came with an indifferent air and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase toiling away calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year
He was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat as an old stagedriver is about the snugness of his box
When close to the whale in the very deathlock of the fight he handled his unpitying lance coolly and offhandedly as a whistling tinker his hammer
Long usage had for this Stubb converted the jaws of death into an easy chair
Whether he ever thought of it at all might be a question but if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir themselves there about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order and not sooner
For like his nose his short black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face
He kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and whenever he turned in he smoked them all out in succession lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter then loading them again to be in readiness anew
A short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whales who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him and therefore it was a sort of point of honour with him to destroy them whenever encountered
This ignorant unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales he followed these fish for the fun of it and a three years voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time
They called him KingPost on board of the Pequod because in form he could be well likened to the short square timber known by that name in Arctic whalers and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas
First of all was Queequeg whom Starbuck the chief mate had selected for his squire
Next was Tashtego an unmixed Indian from Gay Head the most westerly promontory of Marthas Vineyard where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men which has long supplied the neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers
In the fishery they usually go by the generic name of GayHeaders
But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires
To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans and halfbelieved this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air
There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress
Curious to tell this imperial negro Ahasuerus Daggoo was the Squire of little Flask who looked like a chessman beside him
As for the residue of the Pequods company be it said that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the American whale fishery are Americans born though pretty nearly all the officers are
The same I say because in all these cases the native American liberally provides the brains the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles
No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores
In like manner the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London put in at the Shetland Islands to receive the full complement of their crew
They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod ISOLATOES too I call such not acknowledging the common continent of men but each ISOLATO living on a separate continent of his own
On the grim Pequods forecastle ye shall ere long see him beating his tambourine prelusive of the eternal time when sent for to the great quarterdeck on high he was bid strike in with angels and beat his tambourine in glory called a coward here hailed a hero there
Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below I instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain now in the seclusion of the sea became almost a perturbation
This was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijahs diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of
But poorly could I withstand them much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves
It was one of those less lowering but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail foreboding shivers ran over me
Threading its way out from among his grey hairs and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck till it disappeared in his clothing you saw a slender rodlike mark lividly whitish
It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight lofty trunk of a great tree when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it and without wrenching a single twig peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running off into the soil leaving the tree still greenly alive but branded
Whether that mark was born with him or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound no one could certainly say
By some tacit consent throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it especially by the mates
But once Tashtegos senior an old GayHead Indian among the crew superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded and then it came upon him not in the fury of any mortal fray but in an elemental strife at sea
Yet this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived by what a grey Manxman insinuated an old sepulchral man who having never before sailed out of Nantucket had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab
Nevertheless the old seatraditions the immemorial credulities popularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment
So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid outwhich might hardly come to pass so he mutteredthen whoever should do that last office for the dead would find a birthmark on him from crown to sole
So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me and the livid brand which streaked it that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood
Aye he was dismasted off Japan said the old GayHead Indian once but like his dismasted craft he shipped another mast without coming home for it
I was struck with the singular posture he maintained
Not a word he spoke nor did his officers say aught to him though by all their minutest gestures and expressions they plainly showed the uneasy if not painful consciousness of being under a troubled mastereye
And not only that but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe
For as when the redcheeked dancing girls April and May trip home to the wintry misanthropic woods even the barest ruggedest most thundercloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts to welcome such gladhearted visitants so Ahab did in the end a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air
More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look which in any other man would have soon flowered out in a smile
Some days elapsed and ice and icebergs all astern the Pequod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring which at sea almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic
But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world
Inward they turned upon the soul especially when the still mild hours of eve came on then memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights
And all these subtle agencies more and more they wrought on Ahabs texture
Among seacommanders the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the nightcloaked deck
It was so with Ahab only that now of late he seemed so much to live in the open air that truly speaking his visits were more to the cabin than from the cabin to the planks
It feels like going down into ones tombhe would mutter to himselffor an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle to go to my gravedug berth
Avast gritted Ahab between his set teeth and violently moving away as if to avoid some passionate temptation
I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it muttered Stubb as he found himself descending the cabinscuttle
Didnt that DoughBoy the steward tell me that of a morning he always finds the old mans hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled and the sheets down at the foot and the coverlid almost tied into knots and the pillow a sort of frightful hot as though a baked brick had been on it
But theres no telling its the old gameHere goes for a snooze
It flashed like a bleached bone
For a Khan of the plank and a king of the sea and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab
Some moments passed during which the thick vapour came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs which blew back again into his face
How now he soliloquized at last withdrawing the tube this smoking no longer soothes
The fire hissed in the waves the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made
Such a queer dream KingPost I never had
You know the old mans ivory leg well I dreamed he kicked me with it and when I tried to kick back upon my soul my little man I kicked my leg right off
Its not a real leg only a false leg
And theres a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump
Yes thinks I it was only a playful cudgellingin fact only a whaleboning that he gave menot a base kick
Besides thinks I look at it once why the end of itthe foot partwhat a small sort of end it is whereas if a broad footed farmer kicked me THERES a devilish broad insult
Didnt he kick with right good will it wasnt a common pitch pine leg he kicked with was it
No you were kicked by a great man and with a beautiful ivory leg Stubb
In old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen and made garterknights of but be YOUR boast Stubb that ye were kicked by old Ahab and made a wise man of
With that he all of a sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion to swim off into the air
But its made a wise man of me Flask
Well the best thing you can do Flask is to let the old man alone never speak to him whatever he says
What do you think of that now Flask aint there a small drop of something queer about that eh
A white whaledid ye mark that man
Yet is it no easy task
It is not my intention were it in my power to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families
Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters
All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists
Thus speak of the whale the great Cuvier and John Hunter and Lesson those lights of zoology and anatomy
Nevertheless though of real knowledge there be little yet of books there are a plenty and so in some small degree with cetology or the science of whales
On the separate subject of the Greenland or rightwhale he is the best existing authority
But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning
Yet owing to the long priority of his claims and the profound ignorance which till some seventy years back invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown spermwhale and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whaleports this usurpation has been every way complete
Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days will satisfy you that the Greenland whale without one rival was to them the monarch of the seas
But the time has at last come for a new proclamation
This is Charing Cross hear ye good people allthe Greenland whale is deposedthe great sperm whale now reigneth
There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you and at the same time in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt
The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small but so far as it goes it is of excellent quality though mostly confined to scientific description
Far above all other hunted whales his is an unwritten life
Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification if only an easy outline one for the present hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers
I promise nothing complete because any human thing supposed to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty
I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species orin this place at leastto much of any description
But it is a ponderous task no ordinary lettersorter in the PostOffice is equal to it
To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them to have ones hands among the unspeakable foundations ribs and very pelvis of the world this is a fearful thing
The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me
But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans I have had to do with whales with these visible hands I am in earnest and I will try
First The uncertain unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish
But of my own knowledge I know that down to the year 1850 sharks and shad alewives and herring against Linnaeuss express edict were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan
I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin of Nantucket both messmates of mine in a certain voyage and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient
This fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish
But in brief they are these lungs and warm blood whereas all other fish are lungless and cold blooded
To be short then a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL
But the last term of the definition is still more cogent as coupled with the first
Whereas among spouting fish the tail though it may be similarly shaped invariably assumes a horizontal position
Now then come the grand divisions of the entire whale host I am aware that down to the present time the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs Pigfish and Sowfish of the Coffins of Nantucket are included by many naturalists among the whales
BOOK I FOLIO CHAPTER I SPERM WHALEThis whale among the English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale and the Physeter whale and the Anvil Headed whale is the present Cachalot of the French and the Pottsfich of the Germans and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words
It was the idea also that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses
When as I opine in the course of time the true nature of spermaceti became known its original name was still retained by the dealers no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity
It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen and the oil specially known as whale oil an inferior article in commerce
Among the fishermen he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles The Whale the Greenland Whale the Black Whale the Great Whale the True Whale the Right Whale
It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes
It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean on the Brazil Banks on the Nor West Coast and various other parts of the world designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds
But they precisely agree in all their grand features nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction
FINBACKUnder this head I reckon a monster which by the various names of FinBack TallSpout and LongJohn has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic in the New York packettracks
His grand distinguishing feature the fin from which he derives his name is often a conspicuous object
This fin is some three or four feet long growing vertically from the hinder part of the back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointed end
When the sea is moderately calm and slightly marked with spherical ripples and this gnomonlike fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial with its style and wavy hourlines graved on it
Broadnosed whales and beaked whales pikeheaded whales bunched whales underjawed whales and rostrated whales are the fishermens names for a few sorts
And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned
In various sorts of whales they form such irregular combinations or in the case of any one of them detached such an irregular isolation as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis
But it may possibly be conceived that in the internal parts of the whale in his anatomythere at least we shall be able to hit the right classification
And if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated
And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted and it is the only one that can possibly succeed for it alone is practicable
HUMPBACKThis whale is often seen on the northern American coast
He has a great pack on him like a peddler or you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale
At any rate the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one
He is the most gamesome and lighthearted of all the whales making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them
OCTAVOESThese embrace the whales of middling magnitude among which present may be numberedI the GRAMPUS II the BLACK FISH III the NARWHALE IV the THRASHER V the KILLER Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain
Because while the whales of this order though smaller than those of the former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure yet the bookbinders Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume but the Octavo volume does
By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale
BLACK FISHI give the popular fishermens names for all these fish for generally they are the best
I do so now touching the Black Fish socalled because blackness is the rule among almost all whales
His voracity is well known and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face
He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming which looks something like a Roman nose
When not more profitably employed the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employmentas some frugal housekeepers in the absence of company and quite alone by themselves burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax
But it is only found on the sinister side which has an ill effect giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy lefthanded man
Charley Coffin said it was used for an icepiercer for the Narwhale rising to the surface of the Polar Sea and finding it sheeted with ice thrusts his horn up and so breaks through
The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale the Horned whale and the Unicorn whale
He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature
From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same seaunicorns horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison and as such preparations of it brought immense prices
It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn
He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip and hangs there like a leech till the mighty brute is worried to death
He mounts the Folio whales back and as he swims he works his passage by flogging him as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process
Both are outlaws even in the lawless seas
To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it may possibly seem strange that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among WHALESa word which in the popular sense always conveys an idea of hugeness
But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales by the terms of my definition of what a whale isie a spouting fish with a horizontal tail
HUZZA PORPOISEThis is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe
I call him thus because he always swims in hilarious shoals which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a FourthofJuly crowd
Full of fine spirits they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward
They are accounted a lucky omen
If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish then heaven help ye the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye
But the next time you have a chance watch him and you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature
He has no fins on his back most other porpoises have he has a lovely tail and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue
Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable yet a boundary line distinct as the mark in a ships hull called the bright waist that line streaks him from stem to stern with two separate colours black above and white below
His oil is much like that of the common porpoise
This whole book is but a draughtnay but the draught of a draught
Concerning the officers of the whalecraft this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on shipboard arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whalefleet
The large importance attached to the harpooneers vocation is evinced by the fact that originally in the old Dutch Fishery two centuries and more ago the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksnyder
In the British Greenland Fishery under the corrupted title of Specksioneer this old Dutch official is still retained but his former dignity is sadly abridged
Now the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea is thisthe first lives aft the last forward
Indeed many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarterdeck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple and not the shabbiest of pilotcloth
That certain sultanism of his brain which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship
This it is that for ever keeps Gods true princes of the Empire from the worlds hustings and leaves the highest honours that this air can give to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass
Such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency
But when as in the case of Nicholas the Czar the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain then the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization
Nor will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint incidentally so important in his art as the one now alluded to
It is noon and DoughBoy the steward thrusting his pale loafofbread face from the cabinscuttle announces dinner to his lord and master who sitting in the lee quarterboat has just been taking an observation of the sun and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth medallionshaped tablet reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg
When the last echo of his sultans step has died away and Starbuck the first Emir has every reason to suppose that he is seated then Starbuck rouses from his quietude takes a few turns along the planks and after a grave peep into the binnacle says with some touch of pleasantness Dinner Mr Stubb and descends the scuttle
The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile and then slightly shaking the main brace to see whether it will be all right with that important rope he likewise takes up the old burden and with a rapid Dinner Mr Flask follows after his predecessors
But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether and then independent hilarious little Flask enters King Ahabs presence in the character of Abjectus or the Slave
Now if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a shipmaster then by inference you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sealife just mentioned
With one mind their intent eyes all fastened upon the old mans knife as he carved the chief dish before him
What a relief it was to choking Stubb when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below
Had he helped himself at that table doubtless never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless strange to say Ahab never forbade him
Flask was the last person down at the dinner and Flask is the first man up
If Stubb even who is but a peg higher than Flask happens to have but a small appetite and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast then Flask must bestir himself he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck
Besides if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flasks official capacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain ample vengeance was to go aft at dinnertime and get a peep at Flask through the cabin skylight sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab
After their departure taking place in inverted order to their arrival the canvas cloth was cleared or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward
In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captains table was the entire carefree license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers
Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast often the pale DoughBoy was fain to bring on a great baron of saltjunk seemingly quarried out of the solid ox
And if he were not lively about it if he did not go with a nimble hopskipandjump then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back harpoonwise
And once Daggoo seized with a sudden humor assisted DoughBoys memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher while Tashtego knife in hand began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him
He was naturally a very nervous shuddering sort of little fellow this breadfaced steward the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse
It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego opposing his filed teeth to the Indians crosswise to them Daggoo seated on the floor for a bench would have brought his hearseplumed head to the low carlines at every motion of his colossal limbs making the low cabin framework to shake as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship
But for all this the great negro was wonderfully abstemious not to say dainty
But doubtless this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds
DoughBoy hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals
For when they did enter it it was something as a streetdoor enters a house turning inwards for a moment only to be turned out the next and as a permanent thing residing in the open air
And as when Spring and Summer had departed that wild Logan of the woods burying himself in the hollow of a tree lived out the winter there sucking his own paws so in his inclement howling old age Ahabs soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom
It was during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation with the other seamen my first masthead came round
I take it that the earliest standers of mastheads were the old Egyptians because in all my researches I find none prior to them
Of modern standersofmastheads we have but a lifeless set mere stone iron and bronze men who though well capable of facing out a stiff gale are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight
Great Washington too stands high aloft on his towering mainmast in Baltimore and like one of Hercules pillars his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go
But neither great Washington nor Napoleon nor Nelson will answer a single hail from below however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze however it may be surmised that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned
It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the masthead standers of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is not so is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy the sole historian of Nantucket stands accountable
A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand who upon descrying the game gave notice to the readymanned boats nigh the beach
In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the masthead nay to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful
There you stand a hundred feet above the silent decks striding along the deep as if the masts were gigantic stilts while beneath you and between your legs as it were swim the hugest monsters of the sea even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes
There you stand lost in the infinite series of the sea with nothing ruffled but the waves
The tranced ship indolently rolls the drowsy trade winds blow everything resolves you into languor
In one of those southern whalesmen on a long three or four years voyage as often happens the sum of the various hours you spend at the masthead would amount to several entire months
You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watchcoat
Concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mastheads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits called CROWSNESTS in which the lookouts of a Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas
He called it the SLEETS CROWSNEST in honour of himself he being the original inventor and patentee and free from all ridiculous false delicacy and holding that if we call our own children after our own names we fathers being the original inventors and patentees so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget
In shape the Sleets crowsnest is something like a large tierce or pipe it is open above however where it is furnished with a movable sidescreen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale
Being fixed on the summit of the mast you ascend into it through a little traphatch in the bottom
On the after side or side next the stern of the ship is a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for umbrellas comforters and coats
But if we Southern whalefishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were yet that disadvantage is greatly counterbalanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float
For one I used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg or any one else off duty whom I might find there then ascending a little way further and throwing a lazy leg over the topsail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pastures and so at last mount to my ultimate destination
Let me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admit that I kept but sorry guard
But all in vain those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect they are shortsighted what use then to strain the visual nerve
There is no life in thee now except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by the sea from the inscrutable tides of God
Soon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he paced his old rounds upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were all over dented like geological stones with the peculiar mark of his walk
And so full of his thought was Ahab that at every uniform turn that he made now at the mainmast and now at the binnacle you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced so completely possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement
Sir said the mate astonished at an order seldom or never given on shipboard except in some extraordinary case
With bent head and halfslouched hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat
Sing out for him was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices
Good cried Ahab with a wild approval in his tones observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them
A dead whale or a stove boat
More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving grew the countenance of the old man at every shout while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions
But they were all eagerness again as Ahab now halfrevolving in his pivothole with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightly almost convulsively grasping it addressed them thus All ye mastheaders have before now heard me give orders about a white whale
Its a white whale I say resumed Ahab as he threw down the topmaul a white whale
All this while Tashtego Daggoo and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection
Do ye know the white whale then Tash
And has he a curious spout too said Daggoo very bushy even for a parmacetty and mighty quick Captain Ahab
Who told thee that cried Ahab then pausing Aye Starbuck aye my hearties all round it was Moby Dick that dismasted me Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now
Aye aye shouted the harpooneers and seamen running closer to the excited old man A sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance for Moby Dick
Steward go draw the great measure of grog
But whats this long face about Mr Starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale art not game for Moby Dick
If moneys to be the measurer man and the accountants have computed their great countinghouse the globe by girdling it with guineas one to every three parts of an inch then let me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great premium HERE
Vengeance on a dumb brute cried Starbuck that simply smote thee from blindest instinct
To be enraged with a dumb thing Captain Ahab seems blasphemous
All visible objects man are but as pasteboard masks
But in each eventin the living act the undoubted deedthere some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask
To me the white whale is that wall shoved near to me
He tasks me he heaps me I see in him outrageous strength with an inscrutable malice sinewing it
That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate and be the white whale agent or be the white whale principal I will wreak that hate upon him
The Pagan leopardsthe unrecking and unworshipping things that live and seek and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel
Stand up amid the general hurricane thy one tost sapling cannot Starbuck
Tis but to help strike a fin no wondrous feat for Starbuck
But in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of the mate Ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the low laugh from the hold nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts as for a moment their hearts sank in
For again Starbucks downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life the subterranean laugh died away the winds blew on the sails filled out the ship heaved and rolled as before
For with little external to constrain us the innermost necessities in our being these still drive us on
But those wild eyes met his as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison but alas only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian
I have mustered ye all round this capstan and ye mates flank me with your lances and ye harpooneers stand there with your irons and ye stout mariners ring me in that I may in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me
Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright
What when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars using his tiara for ewer
Forthwith slowly going from one officer to the other he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter
Commend the murderous chalices
The long barbed steel goblets were lifted and to cries and maledictions against the white whale the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss
Once more and finally the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew when waving his free hand to them they all dispersed and Ahab retired within his cabin
THE CABIN BY THE STERN WINDOWS AHAB SITTING ALONE AND GAZING OUT
The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track let them but first I pass
Yonder by everbrimming goblets rim the warm waves blush like wine
Tis split toothat I feel the jagged edge galls me so my brain seems to beat against the solid metal aye steel skull mine the sort that needs no helmet in the most brainbattering fight
Gifted with the high perception I lack the low enjoying power damned most subtly and most malignantly damned in the midst of Paradise
I have no long gun to reach ye
Over unsounded gorges through the rifled hearts of mountains under torrents beds unerringly I rush
Will I nill I the ineffable thing has tied me to him tows me with a cable I have no knife to cut
For in his eyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up had I it
The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in as the small goldfish has its glassy globe
A BURST OF REVELRY FROM THE FORECASTLE Oh God to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human mothers in them
The white whale is their demigorgon
Hark the infernal orgies that revelry is forward mark the unfaltering silence aft
Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay embattled bantering bow but only to drag dark Ahab after it where he broods within his sternward cabin builded over the dead water of the wake and further on hunted by its wolfish gurglings
The long howl thrills me through
Oh life tis in an hour like this with soul beat down and held to knowledgeas wild untutored things are forced to feedOh life tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee but tis not me that horrors out of me and with the soft feeling of the human in me yet will I try to fight ye ye grim phantom futures
Ha ha ha ha hem clear my throatIve been thinking over it ever since and that ha has the final consequence
Be sure the old Mogul has fixed him too
SINGS AND ALL FOLLOW Our captain stood upon the deck A spyglass in his hand A viewing of those gallant whales That blew at every strand
Oh your tubs in your boats my boys And by your braces stand And well have one of those fine whales Hand boys over hand
While the bold harpooner is striking the whale
QUIETLY SMOKING Thats a white man he calls that fun humph
O Christ to think of the green navies and the greenskulled crews
Well well belike the whole worlds a ball as you scholars have it and so tis right to make one ballroom of it
Theres naught so sweet on earthheaven may not match itas those swift glances of warm wild bosoms in the dance when the overarboring arms hide such ripe bursting grapes
I still rest me on thy mat but the soft soil has slid
Pines are the hardest sort of tree to live when shifted to any other soil and here theres none but the crews cursed clay
Our captain has his birthmark look yonder boys theres another in the skyluridlike ye see all else pitch black
He wants to bully ahthe old grudge makes me touchy ADVANCING
There the ringed horizon
Duck lower Pip here comes the royal yard
Its worse than being in the whirled woods the last day of the year
Here have I heard all their chat just now and the white whaleshirr shirrbut spoken of once and only this eveningit makes me jingle all over like my tambourinethat anaconda of an old man swore em in to hunt him
In that way mostly the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded
And as for those who previously hearing of the White Whale by chance caught sight of him in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them almost as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him as for any other whale of that species
Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters
For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible eventsas the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi but in maritime life far more than in that of terra firma wild rumors abound wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to
And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there
Alone in such remotest waters that though you sailed a thousand miles and passed a thousand shores you would not come to any chiseled hearthstone or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun in such latitudes and longitudes pursuing too such a calling as he does the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth
No wonder then that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints and halfformed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears
So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike that few who by those rumors at least had heard of the White Whale few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw
Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body
Nor is the preeminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended than on board of those prows which stem him
And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it we find some book naturalistsOlassen and Povelsondeclaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood
And however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these yet in their full terribleness even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson the superstitious belief in them is in some vicissitudes of their vocation revived in the minds of the hunters
That to attempt it would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity
On this head there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted
Nevertheless some there were who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to Moby Dick and a still greater number who chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely without the specific details of any certain calamity and without superstitious accompaniments were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered
One of the wild suggestions referred to as at last coming to be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time
Nor credulous as such minds must have been was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability
But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power
For it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales but as was elsewhere thrown outa peculiar snowwhite wrinkled forehead and a high pyramidical white hump
These were his prominent features the tokens whereby even in the limitless uncharted seas he revealed his identity at a long distance to those who knew him
The rest of his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with the same shrouded hue that in the end he had gained his distinctive appellation of the White Whale a name indeed literally justified by his vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea leaving a milkyway wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden gleamings
For when swimming before his exulting pursuers with every apparent symptom of alarm he had several times been known to turn round suddenly and bearing down upon them either stave their boats to splinters or drive them back in consternation to their ship
But though similar disasters however little bruited ashore were by no means unusual in the fishery yet in most instances such seemed the White Whales infernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death that he caused was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent
Judge then to what pitches of inflamed distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled when amid the chips of chewed boats and the sinking limbs of torn comrades they swam out of the white curds of the whales direful wrath into the serene exasperating sunlight that smiled on as if at a birth or a bridal
Small reason was there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal encounter Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him not only all his bodily woes but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations
The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung
That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe onehalf of the worlds which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devilAhab did not fall down and worship it like them but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale he pitted himself all mutilated against it
All that most maddens and torments all that stirs up the lees of things all truth with malice in it all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain all the subtle demonisms of life and thought all evil to crazy Ahab were visibly personified and made practically assailable in Moby Dick
He piled upon the whales white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down and then as if his chest had been a mortar he burst his hot hearts shell upon it
It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment
In a straitjacket he swung to the mad rockings of the gales
Ahabs full lunacy subsided not but deepeningly contracted like the unabated Hudson when that noble Northman flows narrowly but unfathomably through the Highland gorge
If such a furious trope may stand his special lunacy stormed his general sanity and carried it and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark so that far from having lost his strength Ahab to that one end did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object
So with a broken throne the great gods mock that captive king so like a Caryatid he patient sits upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages
A family likeness aye he did beget ye ye young exiled royalties and from your grim sire only will the old Statesecret come
Nevertheless so well did he succeed in that dissembling that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved and that to the quick with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him
The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause
And so too all the added moodiness which always afterwards to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage sat brooding on his brow
Nor is it so very unlikely that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage on account of such dark symptoms the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales
Gnawed within and scorched without with the infixed unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea such an one could he be found would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes
But be all this as it may certain it is that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and allengrossing object of hunting the White Whale
Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man
Such a crew so officered seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge
The subterranean miner that works in us all how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting muffled sound of his pick
Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag
What the white whale was to Ahab has been hinted what at times he was to me as yet remains unsaid
This elusive quality it is which causes the thought of whiteness when divorced from more kindly associations and coupled with any object terrible in itself to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds
Witness the white bear of the poles and the white shark of the tropics what but their smooth flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are
That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness even more loathsome than terrific to the dumb gloating of their aspect
As for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature when beheld in his ordinary moods strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped
Now in allusion to the white silent stillness of death in this shark and the mild deadliness of his habits the French call him REQUIN
From my forenoon watch below I ascended to the overclouded deck and there dashed upon the main hatches I saw a regal feathery thing of unspotted whiteness and with a hooked Roman bill sublime
As Abraham before the angels I bowed myself the white thing was so white its wings so wide and in those for ever exiled waters I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns
Goney never had heard that name before is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore never
So that by no possibility could Coleridges wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine when I saw that bird upon our deck
Yet in saying this I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet
But how had the mystic thing been caught
Whisper it not and I will tell with a treacherous hook and line as the fowl floated on the sea
But I doubt not that leathern tally meant for man was taken off in Heaven when the white fowl flew to join the wingfolding the invoking and adoring cherubim
Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the White Steed of the Prairies a magnificent milkwhite charger largeeyed smallheaded bluffchested and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty overscorning carriage
He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies
A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western world which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god bluffbrowed and fearless as this mighty steed
Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly which so clothed him with divineness and that this divineness had that in it which though commanding worship at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror
The Albino is as well made as other menhas no substantive deformityand yet this mere aspect of allpervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion
From its snowy aspect the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White Squall
Nor in some historic instances has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary
How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in Froissart when masked in the snowy symbol of their faction the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the marketplace
It cannot well be doubted that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer is the marble pallor lingering there as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world as of mortal trepidation here
And from that pallor of the dead we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them
Therefore in his other moods symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul
And though doubtless some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time and therefore may not be able to recall them now
Why to the man of untutored ideality who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day does the bare mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long dreary speechless processions of slowpacing pilgrims downcast and hooded with newfallen snow
Or to the unread unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American States why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul
Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings which will not wholly account for it that makes the White Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled American than those other storied structures its neighborsthe Byward Tower or even the Bloody
And those sublimer towers the White Mountains of New Hampshire whence in peculiar moods comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name while the thought of Virginias Blue Ridge is full of a soft dewy distant dreaminess
Or why irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets
Or to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance purely addressed to the fancy why in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe does the tall pale man of the Hartz forests whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groveswhy is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg
For Lima has taken the white veil and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe
Old as Pizarro this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions
Second To the native Indian of Peru the continual sight of the snowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread except perhaps in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes
Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the West who with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness
Not so the sailor beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas where at times by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air he shivering and half shipwrecked instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses
But thou sayest methinks that whitelead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul thou surrenderest to a hypo Ishmael
Tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peaceful valley of Vermont far removed from all beasts of preywhy is it that upon the sunniest day if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him so that he cannot even see it but only smells its wild animal muskinesswhy will he start snort and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright
There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home so that the strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils for what knows he this New England colt of the black bisons of distant Oregon
No but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world
Thus then the muffled rollings of a milky sea the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies all these to Ishmael are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt
Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints yet with me as with the colt somewhere those things must exist
Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love the invisible spheres were formed in fright
But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul and more strange and far more portentouswhy as we have seen it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things nay the very veil of the Christians Deity and yet should be as it is the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind
Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation when beholding the white depths of the milky way
Or is it that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour and at the same time the concrete of all colours is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness full of meaning in a wide landscape of snowsa colourless allcolour of atheism from which we shrink
Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt
It was the middlewatch a fair moonlight the seamen were standing in a cordon extending from one of the freshwater butts in the waist to the scuttlebutt near the taffrail
Standing for the most part on the hallowed precincts of the quarterdeck they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet
From hand to hand the buckets went in the deepest silence only broken by the occasional flap of a sail and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel
Aye you are the chap aint ye that heard the hum of the old Quakeresss knittingneedles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket youre the chap
Then seating himself before it you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank
On this hint attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale Since the above was written the statement is happily borne out by an official circular issued by Lieutenant Maury of the National Observatory Washington April 16th 1851
In general the same remark only within a less wide limit applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured aged sperm whales
So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen for example on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast yet it did not follow that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season she would infallibly encounter him there
And where Ahabs chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of allusion has only been made to whatever wayside antecedent extra prospects were his ere a particular set time or place were attained when all possibilities would become probabilities and as Ahab fondly thought every possibility the next thing to a certainty
There it was too that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place there the waves were storied with his deeds there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance
No possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards double Cape Horn and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there
Yet the premature hour of the Pequods sailing had perhaps been correctly selected by Ahab with a view to this very complexion of things
So that Monsoons Pampas NorWesters Harmattans Trades any wind but the Levanter and Simoon might blow Moby Dick into the devious zigzag worldcircle of the Pequods circumnavigating wake
But granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it not but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary whale even if encountered should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter even as a whitebearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople
For the peculiar snowwhite brow of Moby Dick and his snowwhite hump could not but be unmistakable
And here his mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength
Yet these perhaps instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness or fright at his own resolve were but the plainest tokens of its intensity
For at such times crazy Ahab the scheming unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this Ahab that had gone to his hammock was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again
The latter was the eternal living principle or soul in him and in sleep being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing of which for the time it was no longer an integral
Nay could grimly live and burn while the common vitality to which it was conjoined fled horrorstricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth
God help thee old man thy thoughts have created a creature in thee and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever that vulture the very creature he creates
First I have personally known three instances where a whale after receiving a harpoon has effected a complete escape and after an interval in one instance of three years has been again struck by the same hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the same private cypher have been taken from the body
I say I myself have known three instances similar to this that is in two of them I saw the whales struck and upon the second attack saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them afterwards taken from the dead fish
In the threeyear instance it so fell out that I was in the boat both times first and last and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whales eye which I had observed there three years previous
Here are three instances then which I personally know the truth of but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach
Secondly It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery however ignorant the world ashore may be of it that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable
Like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street lest if they pursued the acquaintance further they might receive a summary thump for their presumption
But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrityNay you may call it an oceanwide renown not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death but he was admitted into all the rights privileges and distinctions of a name had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar
Was it not so O Timor Tom thou famed leviathan scarred like an iceberg who so long didst lurk in the Oriental straits of that name whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay
Was it not so O Don Miguel thou Chilian whale marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back
In plain prose here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar
I do not know where I can find a better place than just here to make mention of one or two other things which to me seem important as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the White Whale more especially the catastrophe
For this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error
So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world that without some hints touching the plain facts historical and otherwise of the fishery they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable or still worse and more detestable a hideous and intolerable allegory
First Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery yet they have nothing like a fixed vivid conception of those perils and the frequency with which they recur
One reason perhaps is that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery ever finds a public record at home however transient and immediately forgotten that record
But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own
That point is this The Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful knowing and judiciously malicious as with direct aforethought to stave in utterly destroy and sink a large ship and what is more the Sperm Whale HAS done it
First In the year 1820 the ship Essex Captain Pollard of Nantucket was cruising in the Pacific Ocean
Again At all events the whole circumstances taken together all happening before my own eyes and producing at the time impressions in my mind of decided calculating mischief on the part of the whale many of which impressions I cannot now recall induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion
Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship during a black night an open boat when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore
Secondly The ship Union also of Nantucket was in the year 1807 totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it
Conversation turning upon whales the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present
Some weeks after the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso
But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale that begged a few moments confidential business with him
Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright
I will now refer you to Langsdorffs Voyages for a little circumstance in point peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof
Langsdorff you must know by the way was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusensterns famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century
Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail and the next day we were out in the open sea on our way to Ochotsh
For some days we had very little wind it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up
We were thus placed in the most imminent danger as this gigantic creature setting up its back raised the ship three feet at least out of the water
The masts reeled and the sails fell altogether while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck concluding that we had struck upon some rock instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity
Now the Captain DWolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question is a New Englander who after a long life of unusual adventures as a seacaptain this day resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston
In that up and down manly book of oldfashioned adventure so full too of honest wondersthe voyage of Lionel Wafer one of ancient Dampiers old chumsI found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from Langsdorff that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example if such be needed
Lionel it seems was on his way to John Ferdinando as he calls the modern Juan Fernandes
In our way thither he says about four oclock in the morning when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the Main of America our ship felt a terrible shock which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think but every one began to prepare for death
Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake somewhere about that time did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land
But I should not much wonder if in the darkness of that early hour of the morning the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath
I might proceed with several more examples one way or another known to me of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale
In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius a Christian magistrate of Constantinople in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius general
Now in this history of his Procopius mentions that during the term of his prefecture at Constantinople a great seamonster was captured in the neighboring Propontis or Sea of Marmora after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years
For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it
Even now I am certain that those seas are not and perhaps never can be in the present constitution of things a place for his habitual gregarious resort
Now as a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis
It would be refining too much perhaps even considering his monomania to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted
Starbucks body and Starbucks coerced will were Ahabs so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbucks brain still he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul abhorred his captains quest and could he would joyfully disintegrate himself from it or even frustrate it
It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen
Granting that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knighterrantism in them still while for the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick they must also have food for their more common daily appetites
They may scorn cash now but let some months go by and no perspective promise of it to them and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash would soon cashier Ahab
Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to Ahab personally
From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself
For all these reasons then and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural nominal purpose of the Pequods voyage observe all customary usages and not only that but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession
Be all this as it may his voice was now often heard hailing the three mastheads and admonishing them to keep a bright lookout and not omit reporting even a porpoise
So still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self
There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single ever returning unchanging vibration and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own
This warp seemed necessity and here thought I with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads
To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas from hundreds of whalemens lookouts perched as high in the air but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indians
As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate and by those wild cries announcing their coming
The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity
DoughBoy hurried below glanced at the watch and reported the exact minute to Ahab
So look the long line of manofwars men about to throw themselves on board an enemys ship
But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale
The phantoms for so they then seemed were flitting on the other side of the deck and with a noiseless celerity were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there
This boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats though technically called the captains on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter
A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff
Such was the thunder of his voice that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail the sheaves whirled round in the blocks with a wallow the three boats dropped into the sea while with a dexterous offhanded daring unknown in any other vocation the sailors goatlike leaped down the rolling ships side into the tossed boats below
Hardly had they pulled out from under the ships lee when a fourth keel coming from the windward side pulled round under the stern and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab who standing erect in the stern loudly hailed Starbuck Stubb and Flask to spread themselves widely so as to cover a large expanse of water
But with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command
Here whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle every mothers son of ye draw his knife and pull with the blade between his teeth
Stubbs exordium to his crew is given here at large because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing
He would say the most terrific things to his crew in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing
Besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself so loungingly managed his steeringoar and so broadly gapedopenmouthed at timesthat the mere sight of such a yawning commander by sheer force of contrast acted like a charm upon the crew
Then again Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them
Halloa returned Starbuck turning round not a single inch as he spoke still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew his face set like a flint from Stubbs
What think ye of those yellow boys sir
Strong strong boys in a whisper to his crew then speaking out loud again A sad business Mr Stubb seethe her seethe her my lads but never mind Mr Stubb all for the best
The White Whales at the bottom of it
It aint the White Whale today
It took off the extreme edge of their wonder and so what with all this and Stubbs confident way of accounting for their appearance they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahabs precise agency in the matter from the beginning
For me I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah
Meantime Ahab out of hearing of his officers having sided the furthest to windward was still ranging ahead of the other boats a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him
Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone like five triphammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer
All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed while the boats five oars were seen simultaneously peaked
Not very far distant Flasks boat was also lying breathlessly still its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead a stout sort of post rooted in the keel and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform
But little KingPost was small and short and at the same time little KingPost was full of a large and tall ambition so that this loggerhead standpoint of his did by no means satisfy KingPost
Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat the gigantic negro stooping a little presented his flat palm to Flasks foot and then putting Flasks hand on his hearseplumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders
At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and crossrunning seas
But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious for sustaining himself with a cool indifferent easy unthought of barbaric majesty the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form
Meanwhile Stubb the third mate betrayed no such fargazing solicitudes
The whales might have made one of their regular soundings not a temporary dive from mere fright and if that were the case Stubb as his wont in such cases it seems was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe
To a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have been visible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it and suffusingly blowing off to leeward like the confused scud from white rolling billows
Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling and partially beneath a thin layer of water also the whales were swimming
Seen in advance of all the other indications the puffs of vapour they spouted seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders
But it bade fair to outstrip them it flew on and on as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills
And so shouting he pulled his hat from his head and stamped up and down on it then picking it up flirted it far off upon the sea and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boats stern like a crazed colt from the prairie
Look at that chap now philosophically drawled Stubb who with his unlighted short pipe mechanically retained between his teeth at a short distance followed afterHes got fits that Flask has
Fits yes give him fitsthats the very wordpitch fits into em
But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tigeryellow crew of histhese were words best omitted here for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land
Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words when with tornado brow and eyes of red murder and foamglued lips Ahab leaped after his prey
The repeated specific allusions of Flask to that whale as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boats bow with its tailthese allusions of his were at times so vivid and lifelike that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder
But this was against all rule for the oarsmen must put out their eyes and ram a skewer through their necks usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears and no limbs but arms in these critical moments
Not the raw recruit marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle not the dead mans ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other worldneither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed churned circle of the hunted sperm whale
Soon after two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast but hardly were they overheard when with a lightninglike hurtling whisper Starbuck said Stand up and Queequeg harpoon in hand sprang to his feet
Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that the imminent instant had come they heard too an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter
The whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helterskelter into the white curdling cream of the squall
There we sat up to our knees in the sea the water covering every rib and plank so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean
The wind increased to a howl the waves dashed their bucklers together the whole squall roared forked and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie in which unconsumed we were burning immortal in these jaws of death
In vain we hailed the other boats as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm
So cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg after many failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern then stretching it on a waif pole handed it to Queequeg as the standardbearer of this forlorn hope
The mist still spread over the sea the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat
The sound came nearer and nearer the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge vague form
Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ships bows like a chip at the base of a cataract and then the vast hull rolled over it and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern
Ere the squall came close to the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time
There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns and more than suspects that the joke is at nobodys expense but his own
He bolts down all events all creeds and beliefs and persuasions all hard things visible and invisible never mind how knobby as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints
That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation it comes in the very midst of his earnestness so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous now seems but a part of the general joke
There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod and the great White Whale its object
Queequeg said I when they had dragged me the last man to the deck and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water Queequeg my fine friend does this sort of thing often happen
I suppose then that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whalemans discretion
Will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery Mr Flask for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself backforemost into deaths jaws
Here then from three impartial witnesses I had a deliberate statement of the entire case
This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had done the same thing
After the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion I felt all the easier a stone was rolled away from my heart
I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault
If his leg were off at the hip now it would be a different thing
Among whalewise people it has often been argued whether considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase
Considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties that every individual moment indeed then comprises a peril under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whaleboat in the hunt
As a general thing the jointowners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not
But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person
Now with the subordinate phantoms what wonder remained soon waned away for in a whaler wonders soon wane
But be all this as it may certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew though still as it were somehow distinct from them yet that hairturbaned Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last
But one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah
It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver and by their soft suffusing seethings made what seemed a silvery silence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow
For of these moonlight nights it was his wont to mount to the mainmast head and stand a lookout there with the same precision as if it had been day
But when after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound when after all this silence his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery moonlit jet every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging and hailed the mortal crew
On life and death this old man walked
But though the ship so swiftly sped and though from every eye like arrows the eager glances shot yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night
Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight or starlight as the case might be disappearing again for one whole day or two days or three and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on
Close to our bows strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable searavens
And every morning perched on our stays rows of these birds were seen and spite of our hootings for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp as though they deemed our ship some drifting uninhabited craft a thing appointed to desolation and therefore fit roostingplace for their homeless selves
And heaved and heaved still unrestingly heaved the black sea as if its vast tides were a conscience and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred
But calm snowwhite and unvarying still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky still beckoning us on from before the solitary jet would at times be descried
So with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together
Meantime the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist and the better to guard against the leaping waves each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail in which he swung as in a loosened belt
Few or no words were spoken and the silent ship as if manned by painted sailors in wax day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves
By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed still in silence the men swung in the bowlines still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast
Never could Starbuck forget the old mans aspect when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floorscrewed chair the rain and halfmelted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat
Southeastward from the Cape off the distant Crozetts a good cruising ground for Right Whalemen a sail loomed ahead the Goney Albatross by name
As she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at the foremasthead I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheriesa whaler at sea and long absent from home
All down her sides this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoarfrost
A wild sight it was to see her longbearded lookouts at those three mastheads
Have ye seen the White Whale
But as the strange captain leaning over the pallid bulwarks was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth it somehow fell from his hand into the sea and the wind now rising amain he in vain strove to make himself heard without it
While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whales name to another ship Ahab for a moment paused it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger had not the threatening wind forbade
Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight yet to any monomaniac man the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings
Only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started where those that we left behind secure were all the time before us
But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swims before all human hearts while chasing such over this round globe they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed
The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this the wind and sea betokened storms
But even had this not been the case he would not after all perhaps have boarded herjudging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasionsif so it had been that by the process of hailing he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put
But all this might remain inadequately estimated were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whalingvessels when meeting each other in foreign seas and especially on a common cruisingground
And in return for that courtesy the outwardbound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruisingground to which she may be destined a thing of the utmost importance to her
Besides they would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable chat
For not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils
Though to be sure from the small number of English whalers such meetings do not very often occur and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them for your Englishman is rather reserved and your Yankee he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself
But this is a harmless little foible in the English whalehunters which the Nantucketer does not take much to heart probably because he knows that he has a few foibles himself
Whereas some merchant ships crossing each others wake in the midAtlantic will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition mutually cutting each other on the high seas like a brace of dandies in Broadway and all the time indulging perhaps in finical criticism upon each others rig
As touching Slaveships meeting why they are in such a prodigious hurry they run away from each other as soon as possible
And as for Pirates when they chance to cross each others crossbones the first hail isHow many skullsthe same way that whalers hailHow many barrels
She has a GAM a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even and if by chance they should hear of it they only grin at it and repeat gamesome stuff about spouters and blubberboilers and such like pretty exclamations
Because in the case of pirates say I should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it
And besides when a man is elevated in that odd fashion he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude
Hence I conclude that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on
NOUNA SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO OR MORE WHALESHIPS GENERALLY ON A CRUISINGGROUND WHEN AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS THEY EXCHANGE VISITS BY BOATS CREWS THE TWO CAPTAINS REMAINING FOR THE TIME ON BOARD OF ONE SHIP AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE OTHER
There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here
In a pirate manofwar or slave ship when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable sometimes cushioned seat there and often steers himself with a pretty little milliners tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons
And as for a tiller the whaleboat never admits of any such effeminacy and therefore as in gamming a complete boats crew must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion and the captain having no place to sit in is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree
Nevertheless there have occurred instances well authenticated ones too where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two in a sudden squall sayto seize hold of the nearest oarsmans hair and hold on there like grim death
AS TOLD AT THE GOLDEN INN The Cape of Good Hope and all the watery region round about there is much like some noted four corners of a great highway where you meet more travellers than in any other part
In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick
To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the TownHos story which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men
This latter circumstance with its own particular accompaniments forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates
It was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship one of whom it seems communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep and revealed so much of it in that way that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest
Nevertheless so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it and by such a strange delicacy to call it so were they governed in this matter that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequods mainmast
Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record The ancient whalecry upon first sighting a whale from the masthead still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin
For my humors sake I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Lima to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends one saints eve smoking upon the thickgilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn
Of those fine cavaliers the young Dons Pedro and Sebastian were on the closer terms with me and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put and which are duly answered at the time
Though no small passage was before her yet if the commonest chance favoured he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way because his pumps were of the best and being periodically relieved at them those sixandthirty men of his could easily keep the ship free never mind if the leak should double on her
On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie Don butI crave your courtesymay be you shall soon hear further of all that
Now gentlemen in squaresail brigs and threemasted ships wellnigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla this Lakeman in the landlocked heart of our America had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean
For in their interflowing aggregate those grand freshwater seas of oursErie and Ontario and Huron and Superior and Michiganpossess an oceanlike expansiveness with many of the oceans noblest traits with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes
Thus gentlemen though an inlander Steelkilt was wildocean born and wildocean nurtured as much of an audacious mariner as any
And for Radney though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach to nurse at his maternal sea though in after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman fresh from the latitudes of buckhorn handled bowieknives
It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters some really landless latitude that her captain begins to feel a little anxious
Much this way had it been with the TownHo so when her leak was found gaining once more there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company especially by Radney the mate
He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted sheeted home anew and every way expanded to the breeze
So when they were working that evening at the pumps there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water clear as any mountain spring gentlementhat bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupperholes
The fact is boys that swordfish only began the job hes come back again with a gang of shipcarpenters sawfish and filefish and what not and the whole posse of em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom making improvements I suppose
I wonder if hed give a poor devil like me the model of his nose Damn your eyes whats that pump stopping for roared Radney pretending not to have heard the sailors talk
Quitting the pump at last with the rest of his band the Lakeman went forward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass his face fiery red his eyes bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow
Intolerably striding along the deck the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks and also a shovel and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large
Such gentlemen is the inflexibility of seausages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces
Besides it was the stronger men in the TownHo that had been divided into gangs taking turns at the pumps and being the most athletic seaman of them all Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties such being the case with his comrades
And then without at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers who not being billeted at the pumps had done little or nothing all day
But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him where the Lakeman stood fixed now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions
Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance Steelkilt clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he Steelkilt would murder him
Immediately the hammer touched the cheek the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale
Theres your true Ashantee gentlemen there howl your pagans where you ever find them next door to you under the longflung shadow and the snug patronising lee of churches
Like Mark Antony for days and days along his greenturfed flowery Nile he indolently floats openly toying with his redcheeked Cleopatra ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck
Once a vagabond on his own canal I have received good turns from one of these Canallers I thank him heartily would fain be not ungrateful but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait as to plunder a wealthy one
In sum gentlemen what the wildness of this canal life is is emphatically evinced by this that our wild whalefishery contains so many of its most finished graduates and that scarce any race of mankind except Sydney men are so much distrusted by our whaling captains
Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian cornfield and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas I see
Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensued while standing out of harms way the valiant captain danced up and down with a whalepike calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke him along to the quarterdeck
Steelkilt leaped on the barricade and striding up and down there defied the worst the pistols could do but gave the captain to understand distinctly that his Steelkilts death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands
A fierce cheer was their response
As the Lakemans bare head was just level with the planks the Captain and his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle planted their group of hands upon it and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway
All night a wideawake watch was kept by all the officers forward and aft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge after breaking through the bulkhead below
But the hours of darkness passed in peace the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship
Twice every day for three days this was repeated but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling and then a scuffling was heard as the customary summons was delivered and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle saying they were ready to turn to
The fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution had constrained them to surrender at discretion
Emboldened by this the Captain reiterated his demand to the rest but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged
On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them
Only three were left Better turn to now said the Captain with a heartless jeer Shut us up again will ye cried Steelkilt Oh certainly the Captain and the key clicked
That was the last night he should spend in that den
Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted it would seem upon the same piece of treachery namely to be foremost in breaking out in order to be the first of the three though the last of the ten to surrender and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit
In a few minutes the scuttle was opened and bound hand and foot the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies who at once claimed the honour of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder
But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order a pale man with a bandaged head arrested themRadney the chief mate
Ever since the blow he had lain in his berth but that morning hearing the tumult on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched the whole scene
The mate was in the very act of striking when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm
The three men were then cut down all hands were turned to and sullenly worked by the moody seamen the iron pumps clanged as before
For spite of her leak and spite of all her other perils the TownHo still maintained her mastheads and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale
He was in Radney the chief mates watch and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom after the scene at the rigging he insisted against the express counsel of the captain upon resuming the head of his watch at night
There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship and down between this was the sea
It was given himneither twine nor lanyard were seen again but the next night an iron ball closely netted partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakemans monkey jacket as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow
Twentyfour hours after his trick at the silent helmnigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seamans handthat fatal hour was then to come and in the foreordaining soul of Steelkilt the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse with his forehead crushed in
For by a mysterious fatality Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done
It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day when they were washing down the decks that a stupid Teneriffe man drawing water in the mainchains all at once shouted out There she rolls there she rolls
Whom call you Moby Dick A very white and famous and most deadly immortal monster Donbut that would be too long a story How how cried all the young Spaniards crowding Nay Dons Donsnay nay
Gentlemen a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted
He was always a furious man it seems in a boat
Nothing loath his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge and keeling over spilled out the standing mate
That instant as he fell on the whales slippery back the boat righted and was dashed aside by the swell while Radney was tossed over into the sea on the other flank of the whale
But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between his jaws and rearing high up with him plunged headlong again and went down
In good time the TownHo reached her porta savage solitary placewhere no civilized creature resided
There headed by the Lakeman all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms eventually as it turned out seizing a large double warcanoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harbor
The ships company being reduced to but a handful the captain called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak
But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated both by night and by day and so extreme was the hard work they underwent that upon the vessel being ready again for sea they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel
On the fourth day of the sail a large canoe was descried which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals
He steered away from it but the savage craft bore down on him and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to or he would run him under water
Some ten days after the French ships sailed the whaleboat arrived and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea
Did you get it from an unquestionable source
Bear with me if I seem to press Also bear with all of us sir sailor for we all join in Don Sebastians suit cried the company with exceeding interest Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn gentlemen Nay said Don Sebastian but I know a worthy priest near by who will quickly procure one for me
Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales
I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whaleship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there
It may be worth while therefore previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman
It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest Hindoo Egyptian and Grecian sculptures
Now by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whales is to be found in the famous cavernpagoda of Elephanta in India
The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda all the trades and pursuits every conceivable avocation of man were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being
The Hindoo whale referred to occurs in a separate department of the wall depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedly known as the Matse Avatar
It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda than the broad palms of the true whales majestic flukes
But go to the old Galleries and look now at a great Christian painters portrait of this fish for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian Hindoo
Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that
Nor does Hogarth in painting the same scene in his own Perseus Descending make out one whit better
The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface scarcely drawing one inch of water
It was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century during the Revival of Learning and in those days and even down to a comparatively late period dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan
In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale where all manner of spouts jets deau hot springs and cold Saratoga and BadenBaden come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain
In the titlepage of the original edition of the Advancement of Learning you will find some curious whales
But quitting all these unprofessional attempts let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober scientific delineations by those who know
In another plate the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes
Then again there is an imposing quarto written by one Captain Colnett a Post Captain in the English navy entitled A Voyage round Cape Horn into the South Seas for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries
Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousness of mistake
I do not wish to seem inelegant but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow and as for the narwhale one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys
Then again in 1825 Bernard Germain Count de Lacepede a great naturalist published a scientific systemized whale book wherein are several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan
But the placing of the capsheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier brother to the famous Baron
In 1836 he published a Natural History of Whales in which he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale
Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field Desmarest got one of his authentic abortions that is from a Chinese drawing
Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship with broken back would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars
The living whale in his full majesty and significance is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight like a launched lineofbattle ship and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations
But it may be fancied that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale accurate hints may be derived touching his true form
In fact as the great Hunter says the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it
It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand minus only the thumb
But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering as the human fingers in an artificial covering
And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour is by going a whaling yourself but by so doing you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him
Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales and the True Pictures of Whaling Scenes
In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales I am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books both ancient and modern especially in Pliny Purchas Hackluyt Harris Cuvier etc
I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale Colnetts Hugginss Frederick Cuviers and Beales
In the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to
His frontispiece boats attacking Sperm Whales though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men is admirably correct and lifelike in its general effect
Of the Right Whale the best outline pictures are in Scoresby but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression
He has but one picture of whaling scenes and this is a sad deficiency because it is by such pictures only when at all well done that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters
In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks
The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true
The halfemptied linetub floats on the whitened sea the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene
Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale but let that pass since for the life of me I could not draw so good a one
His jets are erect full and black like soot so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below
Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs shellfish and other sea candies and maccaroni which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back
And all the while the thicklipped leviathan is rushing through the deep leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddlewheels of an ocean steamer
Thus the foreground is all raging commotion but behind in admirable artistic contrast is the glassy level of a sea becalmed the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship and the inert mass of a dead whale a conquered fortress with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whalepole inserted into his spouthole
The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes
With not one tenth of Englands experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt
For the most part the English and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things such as the vacant profile of the whale which so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid
I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager I honour him for a veteran but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace
In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery there are two other French engravings worthy of note by some one who subscribes himself H
It is a quiet noonscene among the isles of the Pacific a French whaler anchored inshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened sails of the ship and the long leaves of the palms in the background both drooping together in the breezeless air
The effect is very fine when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose
The other engraving is quite a different affair the ship hoveto upon the open sea and in the very heart of the Leviathanic life with a Right Whale alongside the vessel in the act of cuttingin hove over to the monster as if to a quay and a boat hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity is about giving chase to whales in the distance
The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole while from a sudden roll of the sea the little craft stands halferect out of the water like a rearing horse
From the ship the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies and to windward a black cloud rising up with earnest of squalls and rains seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen
On Towerhill as you go down to the London docks you may have seen a crippled beggar or KEDGER as the sailors say holding a painted board before him representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg
There are three whales and three boats and one of the boats presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale
His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping at any rate and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings
But though for ever mounted on that stump never a stumpspeech does the poor whaleman make but with downcast eyes stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation
Now one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours is his wonderful patience of industry
An ancient Hawaiian warclub or spearpaddle in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon
As with the Hawaiian savage so with the white sailorsavage
With the same marvellous patience and with the same single sharks tooth of his one poor jackknife he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture not quite as workmanlike but as close packed in its maziness of design as the Greek savage Achilless shield and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage Albert Durer
In bony ribby regions of the earth where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly merged in grass which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges
Then again in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges
Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens and boats in pursuit of them as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds
Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me
And beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the ArgoNavis and joined the chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying Fish
With a frigates anchors for my bridlebitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight
And even when recognised at last their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct in all parts with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse
Indeed in other respects you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore
For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea and though taking a broad general view of the thing this may very well be yet coming to specialties where for example does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog
The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him
The first boat we read of floated on an ocean that with Portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow
Yea foolish mortals Noahs flood is not yet subsided two thirds of the fair world it yet covers
Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever yet not a modern sun ever sets but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews
Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships
Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider the masterless ocean overruns the globe
Consider the subtleness of the sea how its most dreaded creatures glide under water unapparent for the most part and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure
Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks
Consider once more the universal cannibalism of the sea all whose creatures prey upon each other carrying on eternal war since the world began
Consider all this and then turn to this green gentle and most docile earth consider them both the sea and the land and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself
For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti full of peace and joy but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life
Slowly wading through the meadows of brit the Pequod still held on her way northeastward towards the island of Java a gentle air impelling her keel so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze as three mild palms on a plain
And still at wide intervals in the silvery night the lonely alluring jet would be seen
The White Whale the White Whale
Bareheaded in the sultry sun Ahab stood on the bowsprit and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo
Soon it went down and while with oars suspended we were awaiting its reappearance lo in the same spot where it sank once more it slowly rose
Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind
A vast pulpy mass furlongs in length and breadth of a glancing creamcolour lay floating on the water innumerable long arms radiating from its centre and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach
No perceptible face or front did it have no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct but undulated there on the billows an unearthly formless chancelike apparition of life
As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk with a wild voice exclaimedAlmost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him than to have seen thee thou white ghost
There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid
The manner in which the Bishop describes it as alternately rising and sinking with some other particulars he narrates in all this the two correspond
But much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it
By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature here spoken of it is included among the class of cuttlefish to which indeed in certain external respects it would seem to belong but only as the Anak of the tribe
With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented I have here to speak of the magical sometimes horrible whaleline
By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons
In length the common sperm whaleline measures something over two hundred fathoms
As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would in running out infallibly take somebodys arm leg or entire body off the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub
Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists
In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs
First In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon
Thus the whaleline folds the whole boat in its complicated coils twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction
All the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions so that to the timid eye of the landsman they seem as Indian jugglers with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs
If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents to Queequeg it was quite a different object
The next day was exceedingly still and sultry and with nothing special to engage them the Pequods crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea
The waves too nodded their indolent crests and across the wide trance of the sea east nodded to west and the sun over all
And lo close under our lee not forty fathoms off a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate his broad glossy back of an Ethiopian hue glistening in the suns rays like a mirror
But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon
As if struck by some enchanters wand the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel simultaneously with the three notes from aloft shouted forth the accustomed cry as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air
The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale and ere the boats were down majestically turning he swam away to the leeward but with such a steady tranquillity and making so few ripples as he swam that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used and no man must speak but in whispers
Yes a mighty change had come over the fish
All alive to his jeopardy he was going head out that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whales enormous head consists
Besides such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head and such the tapering cutwater formation of the lower part that by obliquely elevating his head he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluffbowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York pilotboat
Wahee screamed the GayHeader in reply raising some old warwhoop to the skies as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave
Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained till the welcome cry was heardStand up Tashtegogive it to him
The oarsmen backed water the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists
It was the magical line
An instant before Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead whence by reason of its increased rapid circlings a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe
Stubb and Tashtego here changed placesstem for sterna staggering business truly in that rocking commotion Partly to show the indispensableness of this act it may here be stated that in the old Dutch fishery a mop was used to dash the running line with water in many other ships a wooden piggin or bailer is set apart for that purpose
From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat and from its now being more tight than a harpstring you would have thought the craft had two keelsone cleaving the water the other the airas the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once
A continual cascade played at the bows a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake and at the slightest motion from within even but of a little finger the vibrating cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea
Thus they rushed each man with might and main clinging to his seat to prevent being tossed to the foam and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double in order to bring down his centre of gravity
Soon ranging up by his flank Stubb firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat darted dart after dart into the flying fish at the word of command the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whales horrible wallow and then ranging up for another fling
The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill
The slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea sent back its reflection into every face so that they all glowed to each other like red men
But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish
And now it is struck for starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his flurry the monster horribly wallowed in his blood overwrapped himself in impenetrable mad boiling spray so that the imperilled craft instantly dropping astern had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day
At last gush after gush of clotted red gore as if it had been the purple lees of red wine shot into the frighted air and falling back again ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea
Yes both pipes smoked out and withdrawing his own from his mouth Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water and for a moment stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made
A word concerning an incident in the last chapter
According to the invariable usage of the fishery the whaleboat pushes off from the ship with the headsman or whalekiller as temporary steersman and the harpooneer or whalefastener pulling the foremost oar the one known as the harpooneeroar
Now it needs a strong nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish for often in what is called a long dart the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet
For one I cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time
In this straining bawling state then with his back to the fish all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cryStand up and give it to him
Again if the dart be successful then at the second critical instant that is when the whale starts to run the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else
It is then they change places and the headsman the chief officer of the little craft takes his proper station in the bows of the boat
I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them
The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention
It is a notched stick of a peculiar form some two feet in length which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon whose other naked barbed end slopingly projects from the prow
But these two harpoons each by its own cord are both connected with the line the object being this to dart them both if possible one instantly after the other into the same whale so that if in the coming drag one should draw out the other may still retain a hold
Tumbled into the water it accordingly is in such cases the spare coils of box line mentioned in a preceding chapter making this feat in most instances prudently practicable
But this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties
Furthermore you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard it thenceforth becomes a dangling sharpedged terror skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale entangling the lines or cutting them and making a prodigious sensation in all directions
Consider now how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong active and knowing whale when owing to these qualities in him as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him
It was a calm so forming a tandem of three boats we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the Pequod
For upon the great canal of HangHo or whatever they call it in China four or five laborers on the footpath will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along as if laden with piglead in bulk
Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night and then handing his lantern to a seaman went his way into the cabin and did not come forward again until morning
But by those clanking links the vast corpse itself not the ship is to be moored
But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome a small strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end and a weight in its middle while the other end is secured to the ship
By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass so that now having girdled the whale the chain is readily made to follow suit and being slipped along the body is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes
Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck his official superior quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs
Stubb was a high liver he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate
The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull within a few inches of the sleepers hearts
Peering over the side you could just see them as before you heard them wallowing in the sullen black waters and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head
This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous
How at such an apparently unassailable surface they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls remains a part of the universal problem of all things
Cook cookwheres that old Fleece he cried at length widening his legs still further as if to form a more secure base for his supper and at the same time darting his fork into the dish as if stabbing with his lance cook you cooksail this way cook
Upon my soul I am about of the same opinion so give the benediction Fleece and Ill away to my supper
Upon this Fleece holding both hands over the fishy mob raised his shrill voice and cried Cussed fellowcritters
And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years cook and dont know yet how to cook a whalesteak rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question
Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment the old negro muttered Best cooked teak I eber taste joosy berry joosy
Passed one once in CapeDown said the old man sullenly
Its an awful question
But perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubbers hole cook but no no cook you dont get there except you go the regular way round by the rigging
Its a ticklish business but must be done or else its no go
All dention said the old black with both hands placed as desired vainly wriggling his grizzled head as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time
Im bressed if he aint more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself muttered the old man limping away with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock
It is upon record that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France and commanded large prices there
Also that in Henry VIIIths time a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises which you remember are a species of whale
The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them
They had a great porpoise grant from the crown
The fact is that among his hunters at least the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him but when you come to sit down before a meatpie nearly one hundred feet long it takes away your appetite
They have such an eatable look that the most selfdenying stranger can hardly keep his hands off
But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish is his exceeding richness
He is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be delicately good
Look at his hump which would be as fine eating as the buffalos which is esteemed a rare dish were it not such a solid pyramid of fat
Nevertheless many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance and then partaking of it
In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their shipbiscuit into the huge oilpots and let them fry there awhile
Many a good supper have I thus made
In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish
And that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calfs head before him is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see
Go to the meatmarket of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds
Look at your knifehandle there my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef what is that handle made ofwhat but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating
With a feather of the same fowl
It is only within the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronise nothing but steel pens
When in the Southern Fishery a captured Sperm Whale after long and weary toil is brought alongside late at night it is not as a general thing at least customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in
Therefore the common usage is to take in all sail lash the helm alee and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight with the reservation that until that time anchorwatches shall be kept that is two and two for an hour each couple the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well
But it was not thus in the present case with the Pequods sharks though to be sure any man unaccustomed to such sights to have looked over her side that night would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese and those sharks the maggots in it
But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts the marksmen could not always hit their mark and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe
They viciously snapped not only at each others disembowelments but like flexible bows bent round and bit their own till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound
A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones after what might be called the individual life had departed
In its socket a stiff pole from twenty to thirty feet long is inserted for a handle
In the first place the enormous cutting tackles among other ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green and which no single man can possibly liftthis vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the maintop and firmly lashed to the lower masthead the strongest point anywhere above a ships deck
The end of the hawserlike rope winding through these intricacies was then conducted to the windlass and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale to this block the great blubber hook weighing some one hundred pounds was attached
This done a broad semicircular line is cut round the hole the hook is inserted and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass
When instantly the entire ship careens over on her side every bolt in her starts like the nailheads of an old house in frosty weather she trembles quivers and nods her frighted mastheads to the sky
More and more she leans over to the whale while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows till at last a swift startling snap is heard with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber
One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long keen weapon called a boardingsword and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass
Whereupon this accomplished swordsman warning all hands to stand off once more makes a scientific dash at the mass and with a few sidelong desperate lunging slicings severs it completely in twain so that while the short lower part is still fast the long upper strip called a blanketpiece swings clear and is all ready for lowering
The heavers forward now resume their song and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale the other is slowly slackened away and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath into an unfurnished parlor called the blubberroom
Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanketpiece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents
And thus the work proceeds the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously both whale and windlass heaving the heavers singing the blubberroom gentlemen coiling the mates scarfing the ship straining and all hands swearing occasionally by way of assuaging the general friction
I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject the skin of the whale
That same infinitely thin isinglass substance which I admit invests the entire body of the whale is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature as the skin of the skin so to speak for it were simply ridiculous to say that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a newborn child
Reckoning ten barrels to the ton you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whales skin
In life the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents
In some instances to the quick observant eye those linear marks as in a veritable engraving but afford the ground for far other delineations
These are hieroglyphical that is if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion
By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular I was much struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi
Like those mystic rocks too the mysticmarked whale remains undecipherable
Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents he not seldom displays the back and more especially his flanks effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance by reason of numerous rude scratches altogether of an irregular random aspect
I should say that those New England rocks on the seacoast which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergsI should say that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular
For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane or still better an Indian poncho slipt over his head and skirting his extremity
But more surprising is it to know as has been proved by experiment that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer
It does seem to me that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality and the rare virtue of thick walls and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness
Like the great dome of St Peters and like the great whale retain O man in all seasons a temperature of thine own
But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things
The vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the ship and every rod that it so floats what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls augment the murderous din
Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky upon the fair face of the pleasant sea wafted by the joyous breezes that great mass of death floats on and on till lost in infinite perspectives
Espied by some timid manofwar or blundering discoveryvessel from afar when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun and the white spray heaving high against it straightway the whales unharming corpse with trembling fingers is set down in the logSHOALS ROCKS AND BREAKERS HEREABOUTS BEWARE
Thus while in life the great whales body may have been a real terror to his foes in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world
Bear in mind too that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh and in that subterraneous manner without so much as getting one single peep into the evercontracting gash thus made he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent interdicted parts and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull
That done if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of
When this last task was accomplished it was noon and the seamen went below to their dinner
An intense copper calm like a universal yellow lotus was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea
A short space elapsed and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from his cabin
Speak thou vast and venerable head muttered Ahab which though ungarnished with a beard yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses speak mighty head and tell us the secret thing that is in thee
That head upon which the upper sun now gleams has moved amid this worlds foundations
Thou sawst the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw and his murderers still sailed on unharmedwhile swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched longing arms
Sail ho cried a triumphant voice from the mainmasthead
But as she was so far to windward and shooting by apparently making a passage to some other ground the Pequod could not hope to reach her
Here be it said that like the vessels of military marines the ships of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal all which signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached every captain is provided with it
Thereby the whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean even at considerable distances and with no small facility
It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board and that Mayhew her captain was fearful of infecting the Pequods company
For though himself and boats crew remained untainted and though his ship was half a rifleshot off and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod
Pulling an oar in the Jeroboams boat was a man of a singular appearance even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities
Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam and a certain man among her crew some time previous when the Pequod spoke the TownHo
According to this account and what was subsequently learned it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the Jeroboam
The unflinching earnestness with which he declared these thingsthe dark daring play of his sleepless excited imagination and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew with an atmosphere of sacredness
Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated say or do what he would so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship
Beware of the horrible plague
Gabriel cried Captain Mayhew thou must either But that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead and its seethings drowned all speech
Hast thou seen the White Whale demanded Ahab when the boat drifted back
Beware of the horrible tail
Nothing was said for some moments while a succession of riotous waves rolled by which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling not heaving it
When this interlude was over Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning Moby Dick not however without frequent interruptions from Gabriel whenever his name was mentioned and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him
Greedily sucking in this intelligence Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale in case the monster should be seen in his gibbering insanity pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated the Shakers receiving the Bible
But when some year or two afterwards Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mastheads Macey the chief mate burned with ardour to encounter him and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity despite all the archangels denunciations and forewarnings Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat
Meantime Gabriel ascending to the mainroyal masthead was tossing one arm in frantic gestures and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity
Now while Macey the mate was standing up in his boats bow and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance lo a broad white shadow rose from the sea by its quick fanning motion temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen
Next instant the luckless mate so full of furious life was smitten bodily into the air and making a long arc in his descent fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards
It is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accidents in the SpermWhale Fishery this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any
But strangest of all is the circumstance that in more instances than one when the body has been recovered not a single mark of violence is discernible the man being stark dead
The whole calamity with the falling form of Macey was plainly descried from the ship
This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically foreannounced it instead of only making a general prophecy which any one might have done and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed
He became a nameless terror to the ship
Mayhew having concluded his narration Ahab put such questions to him that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the White Whale if opportunity should offer
Straightway then Gabriel once more started to his feet glaring upon the old man and vehemently exclaimed with downward pointed fingerThink think of the blasphemerdead and down therebeware of the blasphemers end
Every whaleship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans
It was sorely tumbled damp and covered with a dull spotted green mould in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin
Aye aye its but a dim scrawlwhats this
As he was studying it out Starbuck took a long cuttingspade pole and with his knife slightly split the end to insert the letter there and in that way hand it to the boat without its coming any closer to the ship
Captain Mayhew stand by now to receive it and taking the fatal missive from Starbucks hands he caught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over towards the boat
Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod
As after this interlude the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair
In the tumultuous business of cuttingin and attending to a whale there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew
There is no staying in any one place for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere
It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whales back the blubberhook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates
It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg whose duty it was as harpooneer to descend upon the monsters back for the special purpose referred to
But in very many cases circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded
The whale be it observed lies almost entirely submerged excepting the immediate parts operated upon
So down there some ten feet below the level of the deck the poor harpooneer flounders about half on the whale and half in the water as the vast mass revolves like a treadmill beneath him
Being the savages bowsman that is the person who pulled the bowoar in his boat the second one from forward it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hardscrabble scramble upon the dead whales back
You have seen Italian organboys holding a dancingape by a long cord
Just so from the ships steep side did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea by what is technically called in the fishery a monkeyrope attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist
Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed
So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then that while earnestly watching his motions I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two that my free will had received a mortal wound and that anothers mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death
And yet still further ponderingwhile I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten to jam himstill further pondering I say I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes only in most cases he one way or other has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals
This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkeyrope holder
Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcassthe rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive
A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man
Nevertheless it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them
Accordingly besides the monkeyrope with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious sharkhe was provided with still another protection
They meant Queequegs best happiness I admit but in their hasty zeal to befriend him and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the bloodmuddled water those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall
Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world
That unsounded ocean you gasp in is Life those sharks your foes those spades your friends and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril poor lad
Some hot Cognac
When Stubb reappeared he came with a dark flask in one hand and a sort of teacaddy in the other
Now during the past night and forenoon the Pequod had gradually drifted into a sea which by its occasional patches of yellow brit gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near
But suddenly in the distance they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast
But having plenty of line yet in the tubs and the whale not sounding very rapidly they paid out abundance of rope and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship
For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction and still plied their oars in another the contending strain threatened to take them under
But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain
But the fagged whale abated his speed and blindly altering his course went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him so that they performed a complete circuit
At last his spout grew thick and with a frightful roll and vomit he turned upon his back a corpse
I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard said Stubb not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan
Wants with it said Flask coiling some spare line in the boats bow did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whales head hoisted on her starboard side and at the same time a Right Whales on the larboard did you never hear Stubb that that ship can never afterwards capsize
I never look at him at all but if ever I get a chance of a dark night and he standing hard by the bulwarks and no one by look down there Flaskpointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both handsAye will I
Whats the old man have so much to do with him for
Why do ye see the old man is hard bent after that White Whale and the devil there is trying to come round him and get him to swap away his silver watch or his soul or something of that sort and then hell surrender Moby Dick
I dont know Flask but the devil is a curious chap and a wicked one I tell ye
Why they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flagship once switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike and inquiring if the old governor was at home
What for says the old governor
I think I remember some such story as you were telling said Flask when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship but I cant remember where
Am I the same man that helped kill this whale
But see here Stubb I thought you a little boasted just now that you meant to give Fedallah a seatoss if you got a good chance
I should like to see him try it Id give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldnt dare to show his face in the admirals cabin again for a long while let alone down in the orlop there where he lives and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much
Whos afraid of him except the old governor who daresnt catch him and put him in doubledarbies as he deserves but lets him go about kidnapping people aye and signed a bond with him that all the people the devil kidnapped hed roast for him
So when on one side you hoist in Lockes head you go over that way but now on the other side hoist in Kants and you come back again but in very poor plight
But nothing like this in the present case had been done
Meantime Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whales head and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand
Of the grand order of folio leviathans the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale are by far the most noteworthy
As the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequods side and as we may freely go from one to the other by merely stepping across the deckwhere I should like to know will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here
In the first place you are struck by the general contrast between these heads
As you behold it you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him in point of pervading dignity
In the present instance too this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit giving token of advanced age and large experience
Far back on the side of the head and low down near the angle of either whales jaw if you narrowly search you will at last see a lashless eye which you would fancy to be a young colts eye so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head
Now from this peculiar sideway position of the whales eyes it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead no more than he can one exactly astern
You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight sideline of sight and about thirty more behind it
In a word you would have two backs so to speak but at the same time also two fronts side fronts for what is it that makes the front of a manwhat indeed but his eyes
The whale therefore must see one distinct picture on this side and another distinct picture on that side while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him
This peculiarity of the whales eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes
A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the Leviathan
Nevertheless any ones experience will teach him that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance it is quite impossible for him attentively and completely to examine any two thingshowever large or however smallat one and the same instant of time never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other
True both his eyes in themselves must simultaneously act but is his brain so much more comprehensive combining and subtle than mans that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects one on one side of him and the other in an exactly opposite direction
If you are an entire stranger to their race you might hunt over these two heads for hours and never discover that organ
The ear has no external leaf whatever and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill so wondrously minute is it
With respect to their ears this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right
Let us now with whatever levers and steamengines we have at hand cant over the sperm whales head that it may lie bottom up then ascending by a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach
But come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuffbox with the hinge at one end instead of one side
If you pry it up so as to get it overhead and expose its rows of teeth it seems a terrific portcullis and such alas it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force
With a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board as if it were an anchor and when the proper time comessome few days after the other workQueequeg Daggoo and Tashtego being all accomplished dentists are set to drawing teeth
With a keen cuttingspade Queequeg lances the gums then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts and a tackle being rigged from aloft they drag out these teeth as Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands
As in general shape the noble Sperm Whales head may be compared to a Roman warchariot especially in front where it is so broadly rounded so at a broad view the Right Whales head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliottoed shoe
Two hundred years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemakers last
But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects according to your point of view
If you stand on its summit and look at these two Fshaped spoutholes you would take the whole head for an enormous bassviol and these spiracles the apertures in its soundingboard
Then again if you fix your eye upon this strange crested comblike incrustation on the top of the massthis green barnacled thing which the Greenlanders call the crown and the Southern fishers the bonnet of the Right Whale fixing your eyes solely on this you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak with a birds nest in its crotch
But if this whale be a king he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem
Look at that hanging lower lip what a huge sulk and pout is there a sulk and pout by carpenters measurement about twenty feet long and five feet deep a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more
A great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be harelipped
Over this lip as over a slippery threshold we now slide into the mouth
The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres through which the Right Whale strains the water and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time
In the central blinds of bone as they stand in their natural order there are certain curious marks curves hollows and ridges whereby some whalemen calculate the creatures age as the age of an oak by its circular rings
Sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance
And as those ancient dames moved about gaily though in the jaws of the whale as you may say even so in a shower with the like thoughtlessness do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone
Seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about would you not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ and gazing upon its thousand pipes
This particular tongue now before us at a passing glance I should say it was a sixbarreler that is it will yield you about that amount of oil
It is the same he died with only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away
I think his broad brow to be full of a prairielike placidity born of a speculative indifference as to death
But mark the other heads expression
Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death
Ere quitting for the nonce the Sperm Whales head I would have you as a sensible physiologist simplyparticularly remark its front aspect in all its compacted collectedness
I would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated intelligent estimate of whatever batteringram power may be lodged there
Here is a vital point for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling but not the less true events perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history
Moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose and that what nose he hashis spout holeis on the top of his head you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head nearly one third of his entire length from the front
Wherefore you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whales head is a dead blind wall without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever
In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale as the rind wraps an orange
By itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at
If this be so fancy the irresistibleness of that might to which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes
The Great Heidelburgh Tun
Regarding the Sperm Whales head as a solid oblong you may on an inclined plane sideways divide it into two quoins whereof the lower is the bony structure forming the cranium and jaws and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale
At the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin and then you have two almost equal parts which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance Quoin is not a Euclidean term
A quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering of both sides
The upper part known as the Case may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
And as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front so the whales vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun
Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature
A large whales case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm though from unavoidable circumstances considerable of it is spilled leaks and dribbles away or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can
I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was coated within but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearlcoloured membrane like the lining of a fine pelisse forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whales case
Thus much being said attend now I pray you to that marvellous andin this particular instancealmost fatal operation whereby the Sperm Whales great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped
Then handoverhand down the other part the Indian drops through the air till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head
Therestill high elevated above the rest of the company to whom he vivaciously crieshe seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower
A shorthandled sharp spade being sent up to him he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun
In this business he proceeds very heedfully like a treasurehunter in some old house sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in
By the time this cautious search is over a stout ironbound bucket precisely like a wellbucket has been attached to one end of the whip while the other end being stretched across the deck is there held by two or three alert hands
Carefully lowered from its height the fullfreighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand and quickly emptied into a large tub
Then remounting aloft it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more
Now the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm when all at once a queer accident happened
Man overboard cried Daggoo who amid the general consternation first came to his senses
Meantime there was a terrible tumult
Looking over the side they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea as if that moment seized with some momentous idea whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk
The one remaining hook upon which the entire strain now depended seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way an event still more likely from the violent motions of the head
Come down come down yelled the seamen to Daggoo but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles so that if the head should drop he would still remain suspended the negro having cleared the foul line rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it and so be hoisted out
But hardly had the blinding vapour cleared away when a naked figure with a boardingsword in his hand was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks
The next a loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue
Ha ha cried Daggoo all at once from his now quiet swinging perch overhead and looking further off from the side we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves a sight strange to see as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave
Both bothit is bothcried Daggoo again with a joyful shout and soon after Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian
Now how had this noble rescue been accomplished
Why diving after the slowly descending head Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom so as to scuttle a large hole there then dropping his sword had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards and so hauled out poor Tash by the head
As for the great head itself that was doing as well as could be expected
Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing riding and rowing
I know that this queer adventure of the GayHeaders will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some ones falling into a cistern ashore an accident which not seldom happens and with much less reason too than the Indians considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whales well
Not at all but I have ye for at the time poor Tash fell in the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the wella double welded hammered substance as I have before said much heavier than the sea water and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost
But the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run as you may say
Now had Tashtego perished in that head it had been a very precious perishing smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti coffined hearsed and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale
Only one sweeter end can readily be recalledthe delicious death of an Ohio honeyhunter who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree found such exceeding store of it that leaning too far over it sucked him in so that he died embalmed
Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man
Physiognomically regarded the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature
He has no proper nose
And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression hence it would seem that its entire absence as an external appendage must very largely affect the countenance of the whale
Dash the nose from Phidiass marble Jove and what a sorry remainder
Nevertheless Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude all his proportions are so stately that the same deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous in him is no blemish at all
In some particulars perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the Sperm Whale is that of the full front of his head
Human or animal the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German Emperors to their decrees
But in most creatures nay in man himself very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line
But in the great Sperm Whale this high and mighty godlike dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified that gazing on it in that full front view you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature
Nor in profile does this wondrous brow diminish though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so
And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient World he would have been deified by their childmagian thoughts
If hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure back to their birthright the merry Mayday gods of old and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted hill then be sure exalted to Joves high seat the great Sperm Whale shall lord it
Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics
If then Sir William Jones who read in thirty languages could not read the simplest peasants face in its profounder and more subtle meanings how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whales brow
But in lifeas we have elsewhere seenthis inclined plane is angularly filled up and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm
At the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass while under the long floor of this craterin another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depthreposes the mere handful of this monsters brain
The brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life it is hidden away behind its vast outworks like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of Quebec
So like a choice casket is it secreted in him that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubicyards of his sperm magazine
It is plain then that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan in the creatures living intact state is an entire delusion
The whale like all things that are mighty wears a false brow to the common world
If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end which is the high end you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull beheld in the same situation and from the same point of view
Indeed place this reversed skull scaled down to the human magnitude among a plate of mens skulls and you would involuntarily confound it with them and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit in phrenological phrase you would sayThis man had no selfesteem and no veneration
And by those negations considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power you can best form to yourself the truest though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is
But if from the comparative dimensions of the whales proper brain you deem it incapable of being adequately charted then I have another idea for you
A foreign friend once pointed it out to me in the skeleton of a foe he had slain and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying in a sort of bassorelievo the beaked prow of his canoe
Now I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal
A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul
Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale
His cranial cavity is continuous with the first neckvertebra and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across being eight in height and of a triangular figure with the base downwards
As it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity
Now of course this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substancethe spinal cordas the brain and directly communicates with the brain
And what is still more for many feet after emerging from the brains cavity the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth almost equal to that of the brain
But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists I would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference to the Sperm Whales hump
This august hump if I mistake not rises over one of the larger vertebrae and is therefore in some sort the outer convex mould of it
From its relative situation then I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale
And that the great monster is indomitable you will yet have reason to know
However curious it may seem for an oilship to be borrowing oil on the whaleground and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle yet sometimes such a thing really happens and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lampfeeder as Flask did declare
His necessities supplied Derick departed but he had not gained his ships side when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mastheads of both vessels and so eager for the chase was Derick that without pausing to put his oilcan and lampfeeder aboard he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lampfeeders
There were eight whales an average pod
Full in this rapid wake and many fathoms in the rear swam a huge humped old bull which by his comparatively slow progress as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him seemed afflicted with the jaundice or some other infirmity
As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses careens buries rolls and wallows on her way so did this old whale heave his aged bulk and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous ribends expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin
With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish because not only was he the largest and therefore the most valuable whale but he was nearest to them and the other whales were going with such great velocity moreover as almost to defy pursuit for the time
As for Derick he seemed quite confident that this would be the case and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lampfeeder at the other boats
The ungracious and ungrateful dog cried Starbuck he mocks and dares me with the very poorbox I filled for him not five minutes agothen in his old intense whisperGive way greyhounds
There goes three thousand dollars mena banka whole bank
At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lampfeeder at the advancing boats and also his oilcan perhaps with the double view of retarding his rivals way and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss
In that fine loose chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey the three mates stood up proudly occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of There she slides now
But so decided an original start had Derick had that spite of all their gallantry he would have proved the victor in this race had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman
While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his whiteash and while in consequence Dericks boat was nigh to capsizing and he thundering away at his men in a mighty ragethat was a good time for Starbuck Stubb and Flask
So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks
Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequods boats the advantage and rather than be thus foiled of his game Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart ere the last chance would for ever escape
But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke than all three tigersQueequeg Tashtego Daggooinstinctively sprang to their feet and standing in a diagonal row simultaneously pointed their barbs and darted over the head of the German harpooneer their three Nantucket irons entered the whale
HurrahHere we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar
Hurrah this whale carries the everlasting mail
Giving a sudden gasp he tumultuously sounded
But though boats have been taken down and lost in this way yet it is this holding on as it is called this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes
Because owing to the enormous surface of himin a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feetthe pressure of the water is immense
As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea gazing down into its eternal blue noon and as not a single groan or cry of any sort nay not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths what landsman would have thought that beneath all that silence and placidity the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony
Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock
The next moment relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards as a small icefield will when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea
Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him and so distant and numerous its interior fountains that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period even as in a drought a river will flow whose source is in the wellsprings of faroff and undiscernible hills
Even now when the boats pulled upon this whale and perilously drew over his swaying flukes and the lances were darted into him they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound which kept continually playing while the natural spouthole in his head was only at intervals however rapid sending its affrighted moisture into the air
From this last vent no blood yet came because no vital part of him had thus far been struck
For all his old age and his one arm and his blind eyes he must die the death and be murdered in order to light the gay bridals and other merrymakings of men and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all
A nice spot cried Flask just let me prick him there once
At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish the whale now spouting thick blood with swift fury blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore capsizing Flasks boat and marring the bows
For by this time so spent was he by loss of blood that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made lay panting on his side impotently flapped with his stumped fin then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world turned up the white secrets of his belly lay like a log and died
As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain and with halfstifled melancholy gurglings the spraycolumn lowers and lowers to the groundso the last long dying spout of the whale
Immediately by Starbucks orders lines were secured to it at different points so that ere long every boat was a buoy the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords
It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh on the lower part of the bunch before described
But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales with the flesh perfectly healed around them and no prominence of any kind to denote their place therefore there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to
What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling
To cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house
Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places by the unnatural dislocation
In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable flukechains to pry them adrift from the timberheads and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on the point of going over
No use prying there avast I say with your handspikes and run one of ye for a prayer book and a penknife and cut the big chains
But a few strokes full of sparks were given when the exceeding strain effected the rest
Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface
Be it said however that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species
This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free
But there are instances where after the lapse of many hours or several days the sunken whale again rises more buoyant than in life
Gases are generated in him he swells to a prodigious magnitude becomes a sort of animal balloon
There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method
The gallant Perseus a son of Jupiter was the first whaleman and to the eternal honour of our calling be it said that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent
Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda how the lovely Andromeda the daughter of a king was tied to a rock on the seacoast and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off Perseus the prince of whalemen intrepidly advancing harpooned the monster and delivered and married the maid
It was an admirable artistic exploit rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart
And let no man doubt this Arkite story for in the ancient Joppa now Jaffa on the Syrian coast in one of the Pagan temples there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale which the citys legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew
When the Romans took Joppa the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph
Thou art as a lion of the waters and as a dragon of the sea saith Ezekiel hereby plainly meaning a whale in truth some versions of the Bible use that word itself
Besides it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep
In fact placed before the strict and piercing truth this whole story will fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the Philistines Dagon by name who being planted before the ark of Israel his horses head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him and only the stump or fishy part of him remained
Nor do heroes saints demigods and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order
Our grand master is still to be named for like royal kings of old times we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves
That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster which gives us the dread Vishnoo one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our LordVishnoo who by the first of his ten earthly incarnations has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale
Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter
Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale
But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans who standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale and Arion and the dolphin and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts for all that
And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop
Possibly too Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth but on second thoughts the Right Whale is toothless
But this objection likewise falls to the ground because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a DEAD whaleeven as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents and crawled into them
Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a lifepreserveran inflated bag of windwhich the endangered prophet swam to and so was saved from a watery doom
But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of Nineveh
But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days not to speak of the Tigris waters near the site of Nineveh being too shallow for any whale to swim in
But all these foolish arguments of old SagHarbor only evinced his foolish pride of reasona thing still more reprehensible in him seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea
For by a Portuguese Catholic priest this very idea of Jonahs going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle
Besides to this day the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah
And some three centuries ago an English traveller in old Harriss Voyages speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honour of Jonah in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil
To make them run easily and swiftly the axles of carriages are anointed and for much the same purpose some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat they grease the bottom
Nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage considering that oil and water are hostile that oil is a sliding thing and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely
He seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment
Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities the sleights of hand and countless subtleties to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling
It is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking jerking boat under extreme headway
Steel and wood included the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon and also of a lighter materialpine
It is furnished with a small rope called a warp of considerable length by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting
But before going further it is important to mention here that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet it is seldom done and when done is still less frequently successful on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance which in effect become serious drawbacks
As a general thing therefore you must first get fast to a whale before any pitchpoling comes into play
Handling the long lance lightly glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand so as to secure its free end in his grasp leaving the rest unobstructed
He minds you somewhat of a juggler balancing a long staff on his chin
Next moment with a rapid nameless impulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance and quivers in the life spot of the whale
Let us then look at this matter along with some interesting items contingent
But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs like a human beings the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere
Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world
If I say that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle I do not think I shall err though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words
Assume it and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time
Anomalous as it may seem this is precisely the case with the whale who systematically lives by intervals his full hour and more when at the bottom without drawing a single breath or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air for remember he has no gills
The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true seems the more cogent to me when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT as the fishermen phrase it
Now if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him so that he sounds he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air
How obvious is it too that this necessity for the whales rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase
Not so much thy skill then O hunter as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee
In man breathing is incessantly going onone breath only serving for two or three pulsations so that whatever other business he has to attend to waking or sleeping breathe he must or die he will
But owing to the mystery of the spoutwhether it be water or whether it be vapourno absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head
Sure it is nevertheless that the Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories
Furthermore as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal and as that long canallike the grand Erie Canalis furnished with a sort of locks that open and shut for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale has no voice unless you insult him by saying that when he so strangely rumbles he talks through his nose
Oh happy that the world is such an excellent listener
Now the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air and for several feet laid along horizontally just beneath the upper surface of his head and a little to one side this curious canal is very much like a gaspipe laid down in a city on one side of a street
But the question returns whether this gaspipe is also a waterpipe in other words whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth and discharged through the spiracle
Besides if you regard him very closely and time him with your watch you will find that when unmolested there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration
My dear sir in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things
The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it when always when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout he is in a prodigious commotion the water cascading all around him
For even when tranquilly swimming through the midday sea in a calm with his elevated hump sundried as a dromedarys in the desert even then the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain
Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout
And I know one who coming into still closer contact with the spout whether with some scientific object in view or otherwise I cannot say the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm
And besides other reasons to this conclusion I am impelled by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale I account him no common shallow being inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings or near shores all other whales sometimes are
And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings such as Plato Pyrrho the Devil Jupiter Dante and so on there always goes up a certain semivisible steam while in the act of thinking deep thoughts
While composing a little treatise on Eternity I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me and ere long saw reflected there a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head
The invariable moisture of my hair while plunged in deep thought after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic of an August noon this seems an additional argument for the above supposition
For dye see rainbows do not visit the clear air they only irradiate vapour
And so through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind divine intuitions now and then shoot enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray
Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights less celestial I celebrate a tail
The compact round body of its root expands into two broad firm flat palms or flukes gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness
At the crotch or junction these flukes slightly overlap then sideways recede from each other like wings leaving a wide vacancy between
The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews but cut into it and you find that three distinct strata compose itupper middle and lower
To the student of old Roman walls the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry
Nor does thisits amazing strength at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions where infantileness of ease undulates through a Titanism of power
As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch
Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of that whether wielded in sport or in earnest or in anger whatever be the mood it be in its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace
First Being horizontal in its position the Leviathans tail acts in a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures
Fourth Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity and kittenlike he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth
The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air then smiting the surface the thunderous concussion resounds for miles
You would almost think a great gun had been discharged and if you noticed the light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity you would think that that was the smoke from the touchhole
Excepting the sublime BREACHsomewhere else to be describedthis peaking of the whales flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature
Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven
Standing at the masthead of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea I once saw a large herd of whales in the east all heading towards the sun and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes
As it seemed to me at the time such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld even in Persia the home of the fire worshippers
For according to King Juba the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence
The more I consider this mighty tail the more do I deplore my inability to express it
In an extensive herd so remarkable occasionally are these mystic gestures that I have heard hunters who have declared them akin to FreeMason signs and symbols that the whale indeed by these methods intelligently conversed with the world
The Grand Armada
In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra Java Bally and Timor which with many others form a vast mole or rampart lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes
Unlike the Danes these Orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered topsails from the endless procession of ships before the wind which for centuries past by night and by day have passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east
Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears
Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of European cruisers the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed yet even at the present day we occasionally hear of English and American vessels which in those waters have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged
With a fair fresh wind the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea and thence cruising northwards over waters known to be frequented here and there by the Sperm Whale sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands and gain the far coast of Japan in time for the great whaling season there
For a long time now the circusrunning sun has raced within his fiery ring and needs no sustenance but whats in himself
She has a whole lakes contents bottled in her ample hold
Clear old prime Nantucket water which when three years afloat the Nantucketer in the Pacific prefers to drink before the brackish fluid but yesterday rafted off in casks from the Peruvian or Indian streams
Now as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda indeed as most of the ground roundabout was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising therefore as the Pequod gained more and more upon Java Head the lookouts were repeatedly hailed and admonished to keep wide awake
But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air yet not a single jet was descried
To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together without being greeted by a single spout and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands
Broad on both bows at the distance of some two or three miles and forming a great semicircle embracing one half of the level horizon a continuous chain of whalejets were upplaying and sparkling in the noonday air
Unlike the straight perpendicular twinjets of the Right Whale which dividing at top fall over in two branches like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow the single forwardslanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist continually rising and falling away to leeward
Seen from the Pequods deck then as she would rise on a high hill of the sea this host of vapoury spouts individually curling up into the air and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis descried of a balmy autumnal morning by some horseman on a height
If the wind only held little doubt had they that chased through these Straits of Sunda the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number
But when the swift Pequod with a fresh leading wind was herself in hot chase how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuitmere ridingwhips and rowels to her that they were
As with glass under arm Ahab toandfro paced the deck in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him some such fancy as the above seemed his
But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures
Though banding together in tens of thousands the lionmaned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary horseman
Witness too all human beings how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatres pit they will at the slightest alarm of fire rush helterskelter for the outlets crowding trampling jamming and remorselessly dashing each other to death
For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb
Out of the way Commodore cried one to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface and for an instant threatened to swamp us
Two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together so that they cross each others grain at right angles a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block and the other end of the line being looped it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon
The first and second were successfully darted and we saw the whales staggeringly running off fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg
So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out and the towing whale sideways vanished then with the tapering force of his parting momentum we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake
In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satinlike surface called a sleek produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods
And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles and saw successive pods of whales eight or ten in each swiftly going round and round like multiplied spans of horses in a ring and so closely shoulder to shoulder that a Titanic circusrider might easily have overarched the middle ones and so have gone round on their backs
Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us
Now inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles the entire area at this juncture embraced by the whole multitude must have contained at least two or three square miles
But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side
For suspended in those watery vaults floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers
One of these little infants that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old might have measured some fourteen feet in length and some six feet in girth
He was a little frisky though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule where tail to head and all ready for the final spring the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartars bow
The delicate sidefins and the palms of his flukes still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a babys ears newly arrived from foreign parts
As when the stricken whale that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope as after deep sounding he floats up again and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air so now Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam
Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase this natural line with the maternal end loose becomes entangled with the hempen one so that the cub is thereby trapped
When by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunters lance the mothers pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods
And thus though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and affrights did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments yea serenely revelled in dalliance and delight
Meanwhile as we thus lay entranced the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them
A whale wounded as we afterwards learned in this part but not effectually as it seemed had broken away from the boat carrying along with him half of the harpoon line and in the extraordinary agony of the wound he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold at the battle of Saratoga carrying dismay wherever he went
But agonizing as was the wound of this whale and an appalling spectacle enough any way yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us
So that tormented to madness he was now churning through the water violently flailing with his flexible tail and tossing the keen spade about him wounding and murdering his own comrades
This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright
A low advancing hum was soon heard and then like to the tumultuous masses of blockice when the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain
The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks leaving a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths
But by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening then giving way rapidly and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet
After many similar hairbreadth escapes we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles but now crossed by random whales all violently making for one centre
This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequegs hat who while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales had his hat taken clean from his head by the aireddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by
Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement for having clumped together at last in one dense body they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness
The waif is a pennoned pole two or three of which are carried by every boat and which when additional game is at hand are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale both to mark its place on the sea and also as token of prior possession should the boats of any other ship draw near
The rest contrived to escape for the time but only to be taken as will hereafter be seen by some other craft than the Pequod
The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm Whales and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregations
Now though such great bodies are at times encountered yet as must have been seen even at the present day small detached bands are occasionally observed embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each
In truth this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman swimming about over the watery world surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem
You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower of the Equatorial feeding season having just returned perhaps from spending the summer in the Northern seas and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth
By the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year
When serenely advancing on one of these journeys if any strange suspicious sights are seen my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family
Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encountersfurrowed heads broken teeth scolloped fins and in some instances wrenched and dislocated mouths
Granting other whales to be in sight the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks for these Grand Turks are too lavish of their strength and hence their unctuousness is small
For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery however much for the bower and so being a great traveller he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world every baby an exotic
The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing years is true of all aged Sperm Whales
Almost universally a lone whaleas a solitary Leviathan is calledproves an ancient one
The schools composing none but young and vigorous males previously mentioned offer a strong contrast to the harem schools
For while those female whales are characteristically timid the young males or fortybarrelbulls as they call them are by far the most pugnacious of all Leviathans and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter excepting those wondrous greyheaded grizzled whales sometimes met and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout
Like a mob of young collegians they are full of fight fun and wickedness tumbling round the world at such a reckless rollicking rate that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard
The allusion to the waif and waifpoles in the last chapter but one necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge
For exampleafter a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm and drifting far away to leeward be retaken by a second whaler who in a calm snugly tows it alongside without risk of life or line
But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter
But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it
Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whaletrover litigated in England wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas and when indeed they the plaintiffs had succeeded in harpooning the fish they were at last through peril of their lives obliged to forsake not only their lines but their boat itself
Ultimately the defendants the crew of another ship came up with the whale struck killed seized and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs
In the course of the defence the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his position by alluding to a recent crim con case wherein a gentleman after in vain trying to bridle his wifes viciousness had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life but in the course of years repenting of that step he instituted an action to recover possession of her
Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other
Now the defendants afterwards took the fish ergo the aforesaid articles were theirs
A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge might possibly object to it
What to the rapacious landlord is the widows last mite but a FastFish
What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai the broker gets from poor Woebegone the bankrupt on a loan to keep Woebegones family from starvation what is that ruinous discount but a FastFish
What is the Archbishop of Savesouls income of L100000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of brokenbacked laborers all sure of heaven without any of Savesouls help what is that globular L100000 but a FastFish
But if the doctrine of FastFish be pretty generally applicable the kindred doctrine of LooseFish is still more widely so
What is the great globe itself but a LooseFish
A division which in the whale is much like halving an apple there is no intermediate remainder
Now as this law under a modified form is to this day in force in England and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and LooseFish it is here treated of in a separate chapter on the same courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate car specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty
It seems that some honest mariners of Dover or Sandwich or some one of the Cinque Ports had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore
Holding the office directly from the crown I believe all the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment his
Upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternationso truly Englishknowing not what to say fall to vigorously scratching their heads all round meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger
But that did in nowise mend the matter or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone
Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood
Thinking that viewed in some particular lights the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed under the circumstances a rather hard one an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration
In his treatise on QueenGold or Queenpinmoney an old Kings Bench author one William Prynne thus discourseth Ye tail is ye Queens that ye Queens wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone
But this same bone is not in the tail it is in the head which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne
There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writersthe whale and the sturgeon both royal property under certain limitations and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crowns ordinary revenue
I know not that any other author has hinted of the matter but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish which symbolically regarded may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality
SIR T BROWNE VE It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapoury midday sea that the many noses on the Pequods deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft
I will bet something now said Stubb that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day
It may well be conceived what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale worse than an Assyrian city in the plague when the living are incompetent to bury the departed
In truth it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil
Nevertheless in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this however much he may shun blasted whales in general
Theres a pretty fellow now he banteringly laughed standing in the ships bows theres a jackal for ye
I say pass round a hat some one and lets make him a present of a little oil for dear charitys sake
And as for the other whale why Ill agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours than hell get from that bundle of bones though now that I think of it it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris
By this time the faint air had become a complete calm so that whether or no the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again
Drawing across her bow he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste the upper part of her stempiece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk was painted green and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour
Upon her head boards in large gilt letters he read Bouton de RoseRosebutton or Rosebud and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship
A wooden rosebud eh he cried with his hand to his nose that will do very well but how like all creation it smells
Well then my BoutondeRosebud have you seen the White Whale
The WHITE Whalea Sperm WhaleMoby Dick have ye seen him
What in the devils name do you want here roared the Guernseyman flying into a sudden passion
But come aboard and mayhap hell believe you if he wont me and so Ill get out of this dirty scrape
There a queer scene presented itself
But they worked rather slow and talked very fast and seemed in anything but a good humor
Now and then pairs of them would drop their work and run up to the masthead to get some fresh air
Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the Captains roundhouse abaft and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door which was held ajar from within
Marking all this Stubb argued well for his scheme and turning to the Guernseyman had a little chat with him during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle
He therefore held his peace on that head but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity
According to this little plan of theirs the Guernseyman under cover of an interpreters office was to tell the Captain what he pleased but as coming from Stubb and as for Stubb he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview
He was a small and dark but rather delicate looking man for a seacaptain with large whiskers and moustache however and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watchseals at his side
He vows and declares Monsieur that the other whale the dried one is far more deadly than the blasted one in fine Monsieur he conjures us as we value our lives to cut loose from these fish
Instantly the captain ran forward and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cuttingtackles and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship
Hearing this the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties meaning himself and mate and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux
By this time Stubb was over the side and getting into his boat hailed the Guernseyman to this effectthat having a long towline in his boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ships side
While the Frenchmans boats then were engaged in towing the ship one way Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long towline
You would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam
Stubb was beginning to look disappointed especially as the horrible nosegay increased when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there stole a faint stream of perfume which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it as one river will flow into and then along with another without at all blending with it for a time
I have it I have it cried Stubb with delight striking something in the subterranean regions a purse a purse
Now this ambergris is a very curious substance and so important as an article of commerce that in 1791 a certain Nantucketborn Captain Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject
For at that time and indeed until a comparatively late day the precise origin of ambergris remained like amber itself a problem to the learned
Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for grey amber yet the two substances are quite distinct
The Turks use it in cooking and also carry it to Mecca for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St Peters in Rome
Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret to flavor it
Who would think then that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale
Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of illsavor Colognewater in its rudimental manufacturing stages is the worst
Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly untidy business
Now how did this odious stigma originate
The consequence is that upon breaking into the hold and unloading one of these whale cemeteries in the Greenland dock a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city graveyard for the foundations of a LyinginHospital
I partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland in former times of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack in his great work on Smells a textbook on that subject
But all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler which in a voyage of four years perhaps after completely filling her hold with oil does not perhaps consume fifty days in the business of boiling out and in the state that it is casked the oil is nearly scentless
Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant when as a general thing he enjoys such high health taking abundance of exercise always out of doors though it is true seldom in the open air
I say that the motion of a Sperm Whales flukes above water dispenses a perfume as when a muskscented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor
It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequods crew an event most lamentable and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own
Some few hands are reserved called shipkeepers whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale
As a general thing these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats crews
It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nickname Pip by abbreviation
In outer aspect Pip and DoughBoy made a match like a black pony and a white one of equal developments though of dissimilar colour driven in one eccentric span
But while hapless DoughBoy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects Pip though over tenderhearted was at bottom very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer freer relish than any other race
So though in the clear air of day suspended against a blueveined neck the purewatered diamond drop will healthful glow yet when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre he lays it against a gloomy ground and then lights it up not by the sun but by some unnatural gases
Then come out those fiery effulgences infernally superb then the evilblazing diamond once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies looks like some crownjewel stolen from the King of Hell
The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap paddle in hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest he breasted it overboard with him so as to become entangled in it when at last plumping into the water
In less than half a minute this entire thing happened
Tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate Stubb then in a plain businesslike but still half humorous manner cursed Pip officially and that done unofficially gave him much wholesome advice
Moreover as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future Stubb suddenly dropped all advice and concluded with a peremptory command Stick to the boat Pip or by the Lord I wont pick you up if you jump mind that
In three minutes a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb
Now in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to ride in a springcarriage ashore
But the awful lonesomeness is intolerable
The intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity my God who can tell it
Mark how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open seamark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides
By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot such at least they said he was
Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes and the misermerman Wisdom revealed his hoarded heaps and among the joyous heartless everjuvenile eternities Pip saw the multitudinous Godomnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs
So mans insanity is heavens sense and wandering from all mortal reason man comes at last to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd and frantic and weal or woe feels then uncompromised indifferent as his God
While some were occupied with this latter duty others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs so soon as filled with the sperm and when the proper time arrived this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the tryworks of which anon
It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree that when with several others I sat down before a large Constantines bath of it I found it strangely concreted into lumps here and there rolling about in the liquid part
Such a clearer such a sweetener such a softener such a delicious molifier
After having my hands in it for only a few minutes my fingers felt like eels and began as it were to serpentine and spiralise
Squeeze squeeze squeeze all the morning long I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my colaborers hands in it mistaking their hands for the gentle globules
Such an abounding affectionate friendly loving feeling did this avocation beget that at last I was continually squeezing their hands and looking up into their eyes sentimentally as much as to sayOh my dear fellow beings why should we longer cherish any social acerbities or know the slightest illhumor or envy
Come let us squeeze hands all round nay let us all squeeze ourselves into each other let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness
Plumpudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whales flesh here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness
It tasted something as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne
It designates the dark glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland or right whale and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan
A whalemans nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathans tail it averages an inch in thickness and for the rest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe
But to learn all about these recondite matters your best way is at once to descend into the blubberroom and have a long talk with its inmates
When the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros especially by night
On one side lit by a dull lantern a space has been left clear for the workmen
The whalingpike is similar to a frigates boardingweapon of the same name
Meanwhile the spademan stands on the sheet itself perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horsepieces
Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this postmortemizing of the whale and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange enigmatical object which you would have seen there lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers
Not the wondrous cistern in the whales huge head not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail none of these would so surprise you as half a glimpse of that unaccountable conelonger than a Kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and jetblack as Yojo the ebony idol of Queequeg
Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea and for worshipping which King Asa her son did depose her and destroyed the idol and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of Kings
Look at the sailor called the mincer who now comes along and assisted by two allies heavily backs the grandissimus as the mariners call it and with bowed shoulders staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field
Ere long it is taken down when removing some three feet of it towards the pointed extremity and then cutting two slits for armholes at the other end he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it
The mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling
Immemorial to all his order this investiture alone will adequately protect him while employed in the peculiar functions of his office
That office consists in mincing the horsepieces of blubber for the pots an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse planted endwise against the bulwarks and with a capacious tub beneath it into which the minced pieces drop fast as the sheets from a rapt orators desk
Arrayed in decent black occupying a conspicuous pulpit intent on bible leaves what a candidate for an archbishopric what a lad for a Pope were this mincer Bible leaves
It is as if from the open field a brickkiln were transported to her planks
The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar some ten feet by eight square and five in height
Removing this hatch we expose the great trypots two in number and each of several barrels capacity
It was in the left hand trypot of the Pequod with the soapstone diligently circling round me that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid my soapstone for example will descend from any point in precisely the same time
Removing the fireboard from the front of the tryworks the bare masonry of that side is exposed penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces directly underneath the pots
The intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works
There are no external chimneys they open direct from the rear wall
It was about nine oclock at night that the Pequods tryworks were first started on this present voyage
This was an easy thing for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage
We were clear from the carcase sail had been made the wind was freshening the wild ocean darkness was intense
But that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging as with the famed Greek fire
So the pitch and sulphurfreighted brigs of the bold Hydriote Canaris issuing from their midnight harbors with broad sheets of flame for sails bore down upon the Turkish frigates and folded them in conflagrations
The hatch removed from the top of the works now afforded a wide hearth in front of them
Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers always the whaleships stokers
Opposite the mouth of the works on the further side of the wide wooden hearth was the windlass
Here lounged the watch when not otherwise employed looking into the red heat of the fire till their eyes felt scorched in their heads
Their tawny features now all begrimed with smoke and sweat their matted beards and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works
The continual sight of the fiend shapes before me capering half in smoke and half in fire these at last begat kindred visions in my soul so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm
The jawbone tiller smote my side which leaned against it in my ears was the low hum of sails just beginning to shake in the wind I thought my eyes were open I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart
But spite of all this I could see no compass before me to steer by though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it
Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was somehow in some enchanted way inverted
How glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee
Turn not thy back to the compass accept the first hint of the hitching tiller believe not the artificial fire when its redness makes all things look ghastly
Tomorrow in the natural sun the skies will be bright those who glared like devils in the forking flames the morn will show in far other at least gentler relief the glorious golden glad sun the only true lampall others but liars
The sun hides not the ocean which is the dark side of this earth and which is two thirds of this earth
And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces
At length when the last pint is casked and all is cool then the great hatchways are unsealed the bowels of the ship are thrown open and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea
But a day or two after you look about you and prick your ears in this selfsame ship and were it not for the telltale boats and tryworks you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel with a most scrupulously neat commander
Besides from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale a potent lye is readily made and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side that lye quickly exterminates it
All the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away
But mark aloft there at the three mast heads stand three men intent on spying out more whales which if caught infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture and drop at least one small greasespot somewhere
But one morning turning to pass the doubloon he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them
And some certain significance lurks in all things else all things are little worth and the round world itself but an empty cipher except to sell by the cartload as they do hills about Boston to fill up some morass in the Milky Way
Nor though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last
For it was set apart and sanctified to one awestriking end and however wanton in their sailor ways one and all the mariners revered it as the white whales talisman
Here palms alpacas and volcanoes suns disks and stars ecliptics hornsofplenty and rich banners waving are in luxuriant profusion stamped so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories by passing through those fancy mints so Spanishly poetic
So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world and beneath the great equator and named after it and it had been cast midway up the Andes in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn
Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes summits from one a flame a tower on another on the third a crowing cock while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra
Before this equatorial coin Ahab not unobserved by others was now pausing
Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face but see aye he enters the sign of storms the equinox and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries
No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold but devils claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday murmured Starbuck to himself leaning against the bulwarks
The old man seems to read Belshazzars awful writing
A dark valley between three mighty heavenabiding peaks that almost seem the Trinity in some faint earthly symbol
If we bend down our eyes the dark vale shows her mouldy soil but if we lift them the bright sun meets our glance half way to cheer
Yet oh the great sun is no fixture and if at midnight we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him we gaze for him in vain
There nows the old Mogul soliloquized Stubb by the tryworks hes been twigging it and there goes Starbuck from the same and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long
Ill get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised with Dabolls arithmetic Ill try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar
Youll do to give us the bare words and facts but we come in to supply the thoughts
I see nothing here but a round thing made of gold and whoever raises a certain whale this round thing belongs to him
But avast here comes our old Manxmanthe old hearsedriver he must have been that is before he took to the sea
He luffs up before the doubloon halloa and goes round on the other side of the mast why theres a horseshoe nailed on that side and now hes back again what does that mean
Hark hes mutteringvoice like an old wornout coffeemill
If the White Whale be raised it must be in a month and a day when the sun stands in some one of these signs
Ive studied signs and know their marks they were taught me two score years ago by the old witch in Copenhagen
As I live hes comparing notes looking at his thigh bone thinks the sun is in the thigh or in the calf or in the bowels I suppose as the old women talk Surgeons Astronomy in the back country
No he dont know what to make of the doubloon he takes it for an old button off some kings trowsers
There he stands two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers and two more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket
Ha ha old Ahab the White Whale hell nail ye
My father in old Tolland county cut down a pine tree once and found a silver ring grown over in it some old darkeys wedding ring
And so theyll say in the resurrection when they come to fish up this old mast and find a doubloon lodged in it with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark
Oh the gold the precious precious gold the green miserll hoard ye soon
Hast seen the White Whale
Trumpet to mouth the old man was standing in his hoisted quarterboat his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain who was carelessly reclining in his own boats bow
Hast seen the White Whale
See you this and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone terminating in a wooden head like a mallet
But here a curious difficulty presented itself
In the excitement of the moment Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moments warning
Now it is no very easy matter for anybodyexcept those who are almost hourly used to it like whalemento clamber up a ships side from a boat on the open sea for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson
So deprived of one leg and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain
And in the present instance all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship leaning over the side by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there and swinging towards him a pair of tastefullyornamented manropes for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a onelegged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters
But this awkwardness only lasted a minute because the strange captain observing at a glance how affairs stood cried out I see I seeavast heaving there
This was quickly lowered to Ahab who at once comprehending it all slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and then giving the word held himself fast and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight by pulling handoverhand upon one of the running parts of the tackle
Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks and gently landed upon the capstan head
With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome the other captain advanced and Ahab putting out his ivory leg and crossing the ivory arm like two swordfish blades cried out in his walrus way Aye aye hearty let us shake bones togetheran arm and a legan arm that never can shrink dye see and a leg that never can run
Where didst thou see the White Whalehow long ago
The White Whale said the Englishman pointing his ivory arm towards the East and taking a rueful sight along it as if it had been a telescope there I saw him on the Line last season
I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time
Well one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales and my boat fastened to one of them a regular circus horse he was too that went milling and milling round so that my boats crew could only trim dish by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale
Well this old greatgrandfather with the white head and hump runs all afoam into the pod and goes to snapping furiously at my fastline
Aye I seewanted to part it free the fastfishan old trickI know him
How it was exactly continued the onearmed commander I do not know but in biting the line it got foul of his teeth caught there somehow but we didnt know it then so that when we afterwards pulled on the line bounce we came plump on to his hump instead of the other whales that went off to windward all fluking
Mounttops here by the way CaptainMounttop Mounttopthe captainas I was saying I jumped into Mounttops boat which dye see was gunwale and gunwale with mine then and snatching the first harpoon let this old greatgrandfather have it
But Lord look you sirhearts and souls alive manthe next instant in a jiff I was blind as a batboth eyes outall befogged and bedeadened with black foamthe whales tail looming straight up out of it perpendicular in the air like a marble steeple
No use sterning all then but as I was groping at midday with a blinding sun all crownjewels as I was groping I say after the second iron to toss it overboarddown comes the tail like a Lima tower cutting my boat in two leaving each half in splinters and flukes first the white hump backed through the wreck as though it was all chips
The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out had been all the time standing near them with nothing specific visible to denote his gentlemanly rank on board
His face was an exceedingly round but sober one he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt and patched trowsers and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand and a pillbox held in the other occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains
Oh a great watcher and very dietetically severe is Dr Bunger
But heave ahead boy Id rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man
But I may as well sayen passant as the French remarkthat I myselfthat is to say Jack Bunger late of the reverend clergyam a strict total abstinence man I never drink Water cried the captain he never drinks it its a sort of fits to him fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia but go ongo on with the arm story
Oh you solemn rogue youyou Bunger was there ever such another Bunger in the watery world
What became of the White Whale now cried Ahab who thus far had been impatiently listening to this byplay between the two Englishmen
What should I do without this other arm
Do you know gentlemenvery gravely and mathematically bowing to each Captain in successionDo you know gentlemen that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine Providence that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a mans arm
So that what you take for the White Whales malice is only his awkwardness
For he never means to swallow a single limb he only thinks to terrify by feints
No possible way for him to digest that jackknife and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system
Bless my soul and curse the foul fiends cried Bunger stoopingly walking round Ahab and like a dog strangely snuffing this mans bloodbring the thermometerits at the boiling pointhis pulse makes these planks beatsirtaking a lancet from his pocket and drawing near to Ahabs arm
Ere the English ship fades from sight be it set down here that she hailed from London and was named after the late Samuel Enderby merchant of that city the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby  Sons a house which in my poor whalemans opinion comes not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons in point of real historical interest
Be it distinctly recorded here that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him
In 1778 a fine ship the Amelia fitted out for the express purpose and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys boldly rounded Cape Horn and was the first among the nations to lower a whaleboat of any sort in the great South Sea
The voyage was a skilful and lucky one and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm the Amelias example was soon followed by other ships English and American and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open
But not content with this good deed the indefatigable house again bestirred itself Samuel and all his Sonshow many their mother only knowsand under their immediate auspices and partly I think at their expense the British government was induced to send the sloopofwar Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea
Commanded by a naval PostCaptain the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it and did some service how much does not appear
In 1819 the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan
That shipwell called the Syrenmade a noble experimental cruise and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known
The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin a Nantucketer
All honour to the Enderbies therefore whose house I think exists to the present day though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world
The ship named after him was worthy of the honour being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way
It was a fine gam we had and they were all trumpsevery soul on board
A short life to them and a jolly death
However the masts did not go overboard and by and by we scrambled down so sober that we had to pass the flip again though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste
But the forecastle was not very light and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it
But why was it think ye that the Samuel Enderby and some other English whalers I know ofnot all thoughwere such famous hospitable ships that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and the joke and were not soon weary of eating and drinking and laughing
For as a general thing the English merchantship scrimps her crew but not so the English whaler
Hence in the English this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural but incidental and particular and therefore must have some special origin which is here pointed out and will be still further elucidated
During my researches in the Leviathanic histories I stumbled upon an ancient Dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of it I knew must be about whalers
The title was Dan Coopman wherefore I concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery as every whale ship must carry its cooper
But my friend Dr Snodhead a very learned man professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and St Potts to whom I handed the work for translation giving him a box of sperm candles for his troublethis same Dr Snodhead so soon as he spied the book assured me that Dan Coopman did not mean The Cooper but The Merchant
Texel  Leyden cheese 144000 lbs cheese probably an inferior article 550 ankers of Geneva 10800 barrels of beer
Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading not so in the present case however where the reader is flooded with whole pipes barrels quarts and gills of good gin and good cheer
I impute it though to their naturally unctuous natures being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid Polar Seas on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil
But no more enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers and that the English whalers have not neglected so excellent an example
For say they when cruising in an empty ship if you can get nothing better out of the world get a good dinner out of it at least
How is it that you a mere oarsman in the fishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale
A veritable witness have you hitherto been Ishmael but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams the rafters ridgepole sleepers and underpinnings making up the framework of leviathan and belike of the tallowvats dairyrooms butteries and cheeseries in his bowels
In a ship I belonged to a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons and for the heads of the lances
Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale which after an unusually long raging gale had been found dead and stranded with his head against a cocoanut tree whose plumagelike tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet
When the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathomdeep enfoldings and the bones become dust dry in the sun then the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it
The ribs were hung with trophies the vertebrae were carved with Arsacidean annals in strange hieroglyphics in the skull the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapoury spout while suspended from a bough the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees like the hairhung sword that so affrighted Damocles
It was a wondrous sight
The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen the trees stood high and haughty feeling their living sap the industrious earth beneath was as a weavers loom with a gorgeous carpet on it whereof the groundvine tendrils formed the warp and woof and the living flowers the figures
Through the lacings of the leaves the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure
Oh busy weaver unseen weaverpauseone wordwhither flows the fabric what palace may it deck wherefore all these ceaseless toilings
The weavergod he weaves and by that weaving is he deafened that he hears no mortal voice and by that humming we too who look on the loom are deafened and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it
For even so it is in all material factories
The spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles those same words are plainly heard without the walls bursting from the opened casements
Ah mortal then be heedful for so in all this din of the great worlds loom thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar
Now amid the green liferestless loom of that Arsacidean wood the great white worshipped skeleton lay lounginga gigantic idler
Yet as the everwoven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver himself all woven over with the vines every month assuming greener fresher verdure but himself a skeleton
Life folded Death Death trellised Life the grim god wived with youthful Life and begat him curlyheaded glories
Now when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale and saw the skull an altar and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu
Cutting me a green measuringrod I once more dived within the skeleton
From their arrowslit in the skull the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib How now they shouted Darst thou measure this our god
But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them concerning feet and inches they cracked each others sconces with their yardsticksthe great skull echoedand seizing that lucky chance I quickly concluded my own admeasurements
There is a Leviathanic Museum they tell me in Hull England one of the whaling ports of that country where they have some fine specimens of finbacks and other whales
Moreover at a place in Yorkshire England Burton Constable by name a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale but of moderate size by no means of the fullgrown magnitude of my friend King Tranquos
Sir Cliffords whale has been articulated throughout so that like a great chest of drawers you can open and shut him in all his bony cavitiesspread out his ribs like a gigantic fanand swing all day upon his lower jaw
Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead
But as I was crowded for space and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then composingat least what untattooed parts might remainI did not trouble myself with the odd inches nor indeed should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale
Having already in various ways put before you his skull spouthole jaw teeth tail forehead fins and divers other parts I shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones
But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton as it is by far the most complicated part and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter you must not fail to carry it in your mind or under your arm as we proceed otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view
To me this vast ivoryribbed chest with the long unrelieved spine extending far away from it in a straight line not a little resembled the hull of a great ship newlaid upon the stocks when only some twenty of her naked bowribs are inserted and the keel is otherwise for the time but a long disconnected timber
Now the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet whereas the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet
So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part
Besides for some way where I now saw but a naked spine all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh muscle blood and bowels
Still more for the ample fins I here saw but a few disordered joints and in place of the weighty and majestic but boneless flukes an utter blank
How vain and foolish then thought I for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton stretched in this peaceful wood
No speedy enterprise
They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Gothic spire forming solid courses of heavy masonry
The smallest where the spine tapers away into the tail is only two inches in width and looks something like a white billiardball
The Fossil Whale
Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail and the yards he measures about the waist only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlopdeck of a lineofbattleship
Applied to any other creature than the Leviathanto an ant or a fleasuch portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent
And here be it said that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson expressly purchased for that purpose because that famous lexicographers uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me
To produce a mighty book you must choose a mighty theme
Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales I present my credentials as a geologist by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a stonemason and also a great digger of ditches canals and wells winevaults cellars and cisterns of all sorts
And though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects to justify their taking rank as Cetacean fossils
Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp in Napoleons time
But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster found in the year 1842 on the plantation of Judge Creagh in Alabama
The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile and bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus
A significant illustration of the fact again and again repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body
Here Saturns grey chaos rolls over me and I obtain dim shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics and in all the 25000 miles of this worlds circumference not an inhabitable hands breadth of land was visible
Then the whole world was the whales and king of creation he left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs
I am horrorstruck at this antemosaic unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale which having been before all time must needs exist after all humane ages are over
But not alone has this Leviathan left his preadamite traces in the stereotype plates of nature and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust but upon Egyptian tablets whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous character we find the unmistakable print of his fin
In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah some fifty years ago there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere abounding in centaurs griffins and dolphins similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns
Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale in his own osseous postdiluvian reality as set down by the venerable John Leo the old Barbary traveller
Not far from the Seaside they have a Temple the Rafters and Beams of which are made of WhaleBones for Whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore
The Common People imagine that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the temple no Whale can pass it without immediate death
They keep a Whales Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle which lying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost makes an Arch the Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camels Back
Inasmuch then as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the headwaters of the Eternities it may be fitly inquired whether in the long course of his generations he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires
But upon investigation we find that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary system embracing a distinct geological period prior to man but of the whales found in that Tertiary system those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones
Of all the preadamite whales yet exhumed by far the largest is the Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton
But may it not be that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods may it not be that since Adams time they have degenerated
Assuredly we must conclude so if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny and the ancient naturalists generally
And Lacepede the French naturalist in his elaborate history of whales in the very beginning of his work page 3 sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres three hundred and twentyeight feet
Nor considered aright does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale for example that in former years the latter part of the last century say these Leviathans in small pods were encountered much oftener than at present and in consequence the voyages were not so prolonged and were also much more remunerative
Because as has been elsewhere noticed those whales influenced by some views to safety now swim the seas in immense caravans so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries yokes and pods and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated unfrequent armies
For they are only being driven from promontory to cape and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets then be sure some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle
Furthermore concerning these last mentioned Leviathans they have two firm fortresses which in all human probability will for ever remain impregnable
But as perhaps fifty of these whalebone whales are harpooned for one cachalot some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions
Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe yet what shall we say to Harto the historian of Goa when he tells us that at one hunting the King of Siam took 4000 elephants that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes
And what that is we may soon gain some idea of by imagining all the graveyards cemeteries and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men women and children who were alive seventyfive years ago and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe
In Noahs flood he despised Noahs Ark and if ever the world is to be again flooded like the Netherlands to kill off its rats then the eternal whale will still survive and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood spout his frothed defiance to the skies
The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel Enderby of London had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person
For thought Ahab while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them but at bottom all heartwoes a mystic significance and in some men an archangelic grandeur so do their diligent tracingsout not belie the obvious deduction
With many other particulars concerning Ahab always had it remained a mystery to some why it was that for a certain period both before and after the sailing of the Pequod he had hidden himself away with such GrandLamalike exclusiveness and for that one interval sought speechless refuge as it were among the marble senate of the dead
But be all this as it may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the air or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire have to do or not with earthly Ahab yet in this present matter of his leg he took plain practical procedureshe called the carpenter
And when that functionary appeared before him he bade him without delay set about making a new leg and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jawivory Sperm Whale which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage in order that a careful selection of the stoutest clearestgrained stuff might be secured
But from the same point take mankind in mass and for the most part they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates both contemporary and hereditary
Like all seagoing ship carpenters and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels he was to a certain offhanded practical extent alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own the carpenters pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material
But besides the application to him of the generic remark above this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship upon a three or four years voyage in uncivilized and fardistant seas
Another has the toothache the carpenter out pincers and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation whirling round the handle of his wooden vice the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that if he would have him draw the tooth
But while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him too all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence
Yet was this halfhorrible stolidity in him involving too as it appeared an allramifying heartlessnessyet was it oddly dashed at times with an old crutchlike antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noahs ark
Was it that this old carpenter had been a lifelong wanderer whose much rolling to and fro not only had gathered no moss but what is more had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him
You might almost say that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence for in his numerous trades he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct or simply because he had been tutored to it or by any intermixture of all these even or uneven but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal process
He was a pure manipulator his brain if he had ever had one must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers
He was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful MULTUM IN PARVO Sheffield contrivances assuming the exteriorthough a little swelledof a common pocket knife but containing not only blades of various sizes but also screwdrivers corkscrews tweezers awls pens rulers nailfilers countersinkers
Yet as previously hinted this omnitooled openandshut carpenter was after all no mere machine of an automaton
If he did not have a common soul in him he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty
And this it was this same unaccountable cunning lifeprinciple in him this it was that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing but only like an unreasoning wheel which also hummingly soliloquizes or rather his body was a sentrybox and this soliloquizer on guard there and talking all the time to keep himself awake
FORWARD THE RED FLAME OF THE FORGE IS SEEN WHERE THE BLACKSMITH IS AT WORK
This is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber
Lucky now SNEEZES theres no kneejoint to make that might puzzle a little but a mere shinbonewhy its easy as making hoppoles only I should like to put a good finish on
No fear I like a good grip I like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold man
Aye sir he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work
Hold while Prometheus is about it Ill order a complete man after a desirable pattern
Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome heres one
And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg though it be now so long dissolved then why mayst not thou carpenter feel the fiery pains of hell for ever and without a body
Truly sir if it comes to that I must calculate over again I think I didnt carry a small figure sir
I would be free as air and Im down in the whole worlds books
Then a short little old body like me should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall heronbuilt captains the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick and theres a great cry for lifeboats
But Ahab oh hes a hard driver
According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning and lo no inconsiderable oil came up with the water the casks below must have sprung a bad leak
Much concern was shown and Starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair In Spermwhalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board it is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold and drench the casks with seawater which afterwards at varying intervals is removed by the ships pumps
Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight while by the changed character of the withdrawn water the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo
Now from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and the Bashee Isles between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the China waters into the Pacific
And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the Japanese islandsNiphon Matsmai and Sikoke
With his snowwhite new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table and with a long pruninghook of a jackknife in his hand the wondrous old man with his back to the gangway door was wrinkling his brow and tracing his old courses again
Aye leaks in leaks not only full of leaky casks but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship and thats a far worse plight than the Pequods man
Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed and returning the gun to the rack he went to the deck
So it being calm weather they broke out deeper and deeper disturbing the slumbers of the huge groundtier butts and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above
Tierce after tierce too of water and bread and beef and shooks of staves and iron bundles of hoops were hoisted out till at last the piled decks were hard to get about and the hollow hull echoed under foot as if you were treading over empty catacombs and reeled and rolled in the sea like an airfreighted demijohn
And a well or an icehouse it somehow proved to him poor pagan where strange to say for all the heat of his sweatings he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever and at last after some days suffering laid him in his hammock close to the very sill of the door of death
How he wasted and wasted away in those few longlingering days till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing
But as all else in him thinned and his cheekbones grew sharper his eyes nevertheless seemed growing fuller and fuller they became of a strange softness of lustre and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die or be weakened
And the drawing near of Death which alike levels all alike impresses all with a last revelation which only an author from the dead could adequately tell
Not a man of the crew but gave him up and as for Queequeg himself what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked
He added that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock according to the usual seacustom tossed like something vile to the deathdevouring sharks
No he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket all the more congenial to him being a whaleman that like a whaleboat these coffincanoes were without a keel though that involved but uncertain steering and much leeway adown the dim ages
Now when this strange circumstance was made known aft the carpenter was at once commanded to do Queequegs bidding whatever it might include
There was some heathenish coffincoloured old lumber aboard which upon a long previous voyage had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made
No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order than taking his rule he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequegs measure with great accuracy regularly chalking Queequegs person as he shifted the rule
Ah poor fellow hell have to die now ejaculated the Long Island sailor
Going to his vicebench the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities
When the last nail was driven and the lid duly planed and fitted he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction
Leaning over in his hammock Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye
He then called for his harpoon had the wooden stock drawn from it and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat
All by his own request also biscuits were then ranged round the sides within a flask of fresh water was placed at the head and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot and a piece of sailcloth being rolled up for a pillow Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed that he might make trial of its comforts if any it had
He lay without moving a few minutes then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god Yojo
But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the beaches are only beat with waterlilies will ye do one little errand for me
Seek out one Pip whos now been missing long I think hes in those far Antilles
I have heard murmured Starbuck gazing down the scuttle that in violent fevers men all ignorance have talked in ancient tongues and that when the mystery is probed it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars
So to my fond faith poor Pip in this strange sweetness of his lunacy brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes
Pip was led away and the sick man was replaced in his hammock
Now there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized that while a sick civilized man may be six months convalescing generally speaking a sick savage is almost halfwell again in a day
So in good time my Queequeg gained strength and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days but eating with a vigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his feet threw out his arms and legs gave himself a good stretching yawned a little bit and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat and poising a harpoon pronounced himself fit for a fight
With a wild whimsiness he now used his coffin for a seachest and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes set them in order there
When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South Sea were it not for other things I could have greeted my dear Pacific with uncounted thanks for now the long supplication of my youth was answered that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue
There is one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St John
To any meditative Magian rover this serene Pacific once beheld must ever after be the sea of his adoption
The same waves wash the moles of the newbuilt Californian towns but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands older than Abraham while all between float milkyways of coral isles and lowlying endless unknown Archipelagoes and impenetrable Japans
Lifted by those eternal swells you needs must own the seductive god bowing your head to Pan
Launched at length upon these almost final waters and gliding towards the Japanese cruisingground the old mans purpose intensified itself
His firm lips met like the lips of a vice the Delta of his foreheads veins swelled like overladen brooks in his very sleep his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull Stern all the White Whale spouts thick blood
Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle all waiting to be served holding boatspades pikeheads harpoons and lances and jealously watching his every sooty movement as he toiled
Nevertheless this old mans was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm
A peculiar walk in this old man a certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners
And to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally given in and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate
He was an old man who at the age of nearly sixty had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrows technicals called ruin
But one night under cover of darkness and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement a desperate burglar slid into his happy home and robbed them all of everything
Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him then had the young widow had a delicious grief and her orphans a truly venerable legendary sire to dream of in their after years and all of them a carekilling competency
But Death plucked down some virtuous elder brother on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family and left the worse than useless old man standing till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest
With matted beard and swathed in a bristling sharkskin apron about midday Perth was standing between his forge and anvil the latter placed upon an ironwood log with one hand holding a pikehead in the coals and with the other at his forges lungs when Captain Ahab came along carrying in his hand a small rustylooking leathern bag
While yet a little distance from the forge moody Ahab paused till at last Perth withdrawing his iron from the fire began hammering it upon the anvilthe red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights some of which flew close to Ahab
Are these thy Mother Careys chickens Perth they are always flying in thy wake birds of good omen too but not to alllook here they burn but thouthou livst among them without a scorch
Welding an old pikehead sir there were seams and dents in it
That Parsee smells fire like a fusee and smells of it himself like a hot muskets powderpan
Is not this harpoon for the White Whale
For the white fiend
Here are my razorsthe best of steel here and make the barbs sharp as the needlesleet of the Icy Sea
For a moment the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them
No nono water for that I want it of the true deathtemper
Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh and the White Whales barbs were then tempered
Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris sed in nomine diaboli deliriously howled Ahab as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood
Now mustering the spare poles from below and selecting one of hickory with the bark still investing it Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron
A coil of new towline was then unwound and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass and stretched to a great tension
At one extremity the rope was unstranded and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon the pole was then driven hard up into the socket from the lower end the rope was traced halfway along the poles length and firmly secured so with intertwistings of twine
Oh Pip thy wretched laugh thy idle but unresting eye all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship and mocked it
The longdrawn virgin vales the mild blue hillsides as over these there steals the hush the hum you almost swear that playwearied children lie sleeping in these solitudes in some glad Maytime when the flowers of the woods are plucked
Oh grassy glades oh ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul in yethough long parched by the dead drought of the earthy lifein ye men yet may roll like young horses in new morning clover and for some few fleeting moments feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them
There is no steady unretracing progress in this life we do not advance through fixed gradations and at the last one pausethrough infancys unconscious spell boyhoods thoughtless faith adolescence doubt the common doom then scepticism then disbelief resting at last in manhoods pondering repose of If
Where lies the final harbor whence we unmoor no more
And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind some few weeks after Ahabs harpoon had been welded
The three men at her masthead wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats from the stern a whaleboat was suspended bottom down and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain
Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm above which in her topmast crosstrees you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp
As was afterwards learned the Bachelor had met with the most surprising success all the more wonderful for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish
Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindlingwood and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oilbutt lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece
As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle and drawing still nearer a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge trypots which covered with the parchmentlike POKE or stomach skin of the black fish gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew
On the quarterdeck the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olivehued girls who had eloped with them from the Polynesian Isles while suspended in an ornamented boat firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast three Long Island negroes with glittering fiddlebows of whale ivory were presiding over the hilarious jig
Meanwhile others of the ships company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the tryworks from which the huge pots had been removed
And Ahab he too was standing on his quarterdeck shaggy and black with a stubborn gloom and as the two ships crossed each others wakesone all jubilations for things passed the other all forebodings as to things to cometheir two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene
Come aboard come aboard cried the gay Bachelors commander lifting a glass and a bottle in the air
Hast seen the White Whale gritted Ahab in reply
Come along will ye merrys the play a full ship and homewardbound
How wondrous familiar is a fool muttered Ahab then aloud Thou art a full ship and homeward bound thou sayst well then call me an empty ship and outwardbound
For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor whales were seen and four were slain and one of them by Ahab
Nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head and then gone round again without a lesson to me
All thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here I am buoyed by breaths of once living things exhaled as air but water now
Then hail for ever hail O sea in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl finds his only rest
The waifpole was thrust upright into the dead whales spouthole and the lantern hanging from its top cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black glossy back and far out upon the midnight waves which gently chafed the whales broad flank like soft surf upon a beach
Started from his slumbers Ahab face to face saw the Parsee and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world
But I said old man that ere thou couldst die on this voyage two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea the first not made by mortal hands and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in America
Aye aye a strange sight that Parseea hearse and its plumes floating over the ocean with the waves for the pallbearers
The grey dawn came on and the slumbering crew arose from the boats bottom and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship
The season for the Line at length drew near and every day when Ahab coming from his cabin cast his eyes aloft the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon impatient for the order to point the ships prow for the equator
That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy oceans immeasurable burningglass
The sky looks lacquered clouds there are none the horizon floats and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of Gods throne
So swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship and with his astrologicallooking instrument placed to his eye he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian
Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ships deck and with face thrown up like Ahabs was eyeing the same sun with him only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness
Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living
These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him aye and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown thither side of thee thou sun
Curse thee thou vain toy and cursed be all the things that cast mans eyes aloft to that heaven whose live vividness but scorches him as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light O sun
Old man of oceans of all this fiery life of thine what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes
Well well I heard Ahab mutter Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine swears that I must play them and no others
Skies the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands
So too it is that in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms the Typhoon
When darkness came on sky and sea roared and split with the thunder and blazed with the lightning that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the tempest had left for its after sport
But never mind its all in fun so the old song saysSINGS
Avast Stubb cried Starbuck let the Typhoon sing and strike his harp here in our rigging but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace
But I am not a brave man never said I was a brave man I am a coward and I sing to keep up my spirits
What how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else never mind how foolish
Here cried Starbuck seizing Stubb by the shoulder and pointing his hand towards the weather bow markest thou not that the gale comes from the eastward the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick the very course he swung to this day noon now mark his boat there where is that stove
The gale that now hammers at us to stave us we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home
At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness following the flashes a voice was heard at his side and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead
Now as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast is intended to conduct it into the water
The rods the rods cried Starbuck to the crew suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux to light Ahab to his post
All the yardarms were tipped with a pallid fire and touched at each tripointed lightningrodend with three tapering white flames each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar
Relieved against the ghostly light the gigantic jet negro Daggoo loomed up to thrice his real stature and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come
The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his sharkwhite teeth which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants while lit up by the preternatural light Queequegs tattooing burned like Satanic blue flames on his body
Yes our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candlesthats the good promise we saw
Look up at it mark it well the white flame but lights the way to the White Whale
Then turningthe last link held fast in his left hand he put his foot upon the Parsee and with fixed upward eye and highflung right arm he stood erect before the lofty tripointed trinity of flames
Oh thou clear spirit of clear fire whom on these seas I as Persian once did worship till in the sacramental act so burned by thee that to this hour I bear the scar I now know thee thou clear spirit and I now know that thy right worship is defiance
No fearless fool now fronts thee
I own thy speechless placeless power but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional unintegral mastery in me
Oh thou clear spirit of thy fire thou madest me and like a true child of fire I breathe it back to thee
Take the homage of these poor eyes and shutterhands
The lightning flashes through my skull mine eyeballs ache and ache my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded and rolling on some stunning ground
There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee thou clear spirit to whom all thy eternity is but time all thy creativeness mechanical
Ahabs harpoon the one forged at Perths fire remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch so that it projected beyond his whaleboats bow but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale forked fire
As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpents tongue Starbuck grasped Ahab by the armGod God is against thee old man forbear tis an ill voyage ill begun ill continued let me square the yards while we may old man and make a fair wind of it homewards to go on a better voyage than this
For the moment all the aghast mates thoughts seemed theirs they raised a half mutinous cry
Petrified by his aspect and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held the men fell back in dismay and Ahab again spoke All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine and heart soul and body lungs and life old Ahab is bound
And that ye may know to what tune this heart beats look ye here thus I blow out the last fear
As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain men fly the neighborhood of some lone gigantic elm whose very height and strength but render it so much the more unsafe because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts so at those last words of Ahabs many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay
I would een take it for sublime did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady
Dont you see then that for these extra risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees
But hark again and Ill answer ye the other thing
Whats the mighty difference between holding a masts lightningrod in the storm and standing close by a mast that hasnt got any lightningrod at all in a storm
Why you KingPost you I suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small lightningrod running up the corner of his hat like a militia officers skewered feather and trailing behind like his sash
This is a nasty night lad
In a severe gale like this while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses at intervals go round and round
But as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible watching the compass meanwhile lo a good sign the wind seemed coming round astern aye the foul breeze became fair
THE FAIR WIND
OHYEHO CHEERLY MEN the crew singing for joy that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it
The cabin lamptaking long swings this way and thatwas burning fitfully and casting fitful shadows upon the old mans bolted doora thin one with fixed blinds inserted in place of upper panels
The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead
He would have shot me once he murmured yes theres the very musket that he pointed at methat one with the studded stock let me touch itlift it
Ill hold the musket boldly while I thinkI come to report a fair wind to him
Its a fair wind thats only fair for that accursed fishThe very tube he pointed at methe very one THIS oneI hold it here he would have killed me with the very thing I handle nowAye and he would fain kill all his crew
Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant and in these same perilous seas gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the errorabounding log and in this very Typhoon did he not swear that he would have no lightningrods
But shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ships company down to doom with himYes it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harm my soul swears this ship will if Ahab have his way
Great God forbidBut is there no other way no lawful wayMake him a prisoner to be taken home
What hope to wrest this old mans living power from his own living hands
I stand alone here upon an open sea with two oceans and a whole continent between me and lawAye aye tis soIs heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a wouldbe murderer in his bed tindering sheets and skin togetherAnd would I be a murderer then ifand slowly stealthily and half sideways looking he placed the loaded muskets end against the door
Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old mans tormented sleep as if Starbucks voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak
The strong unstaggering breeze abounded so that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails the whole world boomed before the wind
Muffled in the full morning light the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks
Long maintaining an enchanted silence Ahab stood apart and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye the bright suns rays produced ahead and when she profoundly settled by the stern he turned behind and saw the suns rearward place and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake
Yoke on the further billows hallo a tandem I drive the sea
But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed I have it
Aye but never before has it happened to me sir said the pale mate gloomily
The magnetic energy as developed in the mariners needle is as all know essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven hence it is not to be much marvelled at that such things should be
Instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal all its loadstone virtue being annihilated so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wifes knitting needle
But in either case the needle never again of itself recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost and if the binnacle compasses be affected the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson
Deliberately standing before the binnacle and eyeing the transpointed compasses the old man with the sharp of his extended hand now took the precise bearing of the sun and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted shouted out his orders for the ships course to be changed accordingly
Meanwhile whatever were his own secret thoughts Starbuck said nothing but quietly he issued all requisite orders while Stubb and Flaskwho in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelingslikewise unmurmuringly acquiesced
But as ever before the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed or if impressed it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahabs
For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries
Accessory perhaps to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do were certain prudential motives whose object might have been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses
Besides the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles though clumsily practicable was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors without some shudderings and evil portents
With a blow from the topmaul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining bade him hold it upright without its touching the deck
Then with the maul after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less strongly hammered that several times the mate still holding the rod as before
The wooden reel and angular log attached hung long untouched just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks
They went towards the extreme stern on the ships lee side where the deck with the oblique energy of the wind was now almost dipping into the creamy sidelongrushing sea
The Manxman took the reel and holding it high up by the projecting handleends of the spindle round which the spool of line revolved so stood with the angular log hanging downwards till Ahab advanced to him
Ahab stood before him and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary handcoil to toss overboard when the old Manxman who was intently eyeing both him and the line made bold to speak
With these grey hairs of mine tis not worth while disputing specially with a superior wholl neer confess
Well the other way its good
The dead blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last
The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long dragging line astern and then instantly the reel began to whirl
In turn jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely
I crush the quadrant the thunder turns the needles and now the mad sea parts the logline
I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of thy eyes
Lo ye believers in gods all goodness and in man all ill lo you see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man and man though idiotic and knowing not what he does yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude
There go two daft ones now muttered the old Manxman
But heres the end of the rotten lineall dripping too
I think we had best have a new line altogether
The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids and shuddered but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled
Yet the grey Manxmanthe oldest mariner of alldeclared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea
Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals and some young seals that had lost their dams or some dams that had lost their cubs must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail
And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the White Whale on the White Whales own peculiar ground that man was swallowed up in the deep
They declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before
But again the old Manxman said nay
Its like turning an old coat going to bring the flesh on the other side now
Its the old womans tricks to be giving cobbling jobs
Lord what an affection all old women have for tinkers
I know an old woman of sixtyfive who ran away with a baldheaded young tinker once
THE COFFIN LAID UPON TWO LINETUBS BETWEEN THE VICEBENCH AND THE OPEN HATCHWAY THE CARPENTER CAULKING ITS SEAMS THE STRING OF TWISTED OAKUM SLOWLY UNWINDING FROM A LARGE ROLL OF IT PLACED IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FROCKAHAB COMES SLOWLY FROM THE CABINGANGWAY AND HEARS PIP FOLLOWING HIM
Then tell me art thou not an arrant allgrasping intermeddling monopolising heathenish old scamp to be one day making legs and the next day coffins to clap them in and yet again lifebuoys out of those same coffins
This wooden mallet is the cork and Im the professor of musical glassestap tap
The greyheaded woodpecker tapping the hollow tree
Here nows the very dreaded symbol of grim death by a mere hap made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life
Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is after all but an immortalitypreserver
So far gone am I in the dark side of earth that its other side the theoretic bright one seems but uncertain twilight to me
Some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee
Next day a large ship the Rachel was descried bearing directly down upon the Pequod all her spars thickly clustering with men
At the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water but as the broadwinged windward stranger shot nigh to her the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst and all life fled from the smitten hull
Bad news she brings bad news muttered the old Manxman
Hast seen the White Whale
Throttling his joy Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question and would then have fain boarded the stranger when the stranger captain himself having stopped his vessels way was seen descending her side
But no formal salutation was exchanged
After a keen sail before the wind this fourth boatthe swiftest keeled of allseemed to have succeeded in fasteningat least as well as the man at the masthead could tell anything about it
In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water and after that nothing more whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers as often happens
There was some apprehension but no positive alarm as yet
But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard she crowded all sailstunsail on stunsailafter the missing boat kindling a fire in her trypots for a beacon and every other man aloft on the lookout
He desired that ship to unite with his own in the search by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart on parallel lines and so sweeping a double horizon as it were
See Flask only see how pale he lookspale in the very buttons of his eyeslookit wasnt the coatit must have been the My boy my own boy is among them
For eightandforty hours let me charter your shipI will gladly pay for it and roundly pay for itif there be no other wayfor eightandforty hours onlyonly thatyou must oh you must and you SHALL do this thing
Hes drowned with the rest on em last night said the old Manx sailor standing behind them I heard all of ye heard their spirits
Nor does it unfrequently occur that Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them for a protracted three or four years voyage in some other ship than their own so that their first knowledge of a whalemans career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a fathers natural but untimely partiality or undue apprehensiveness and concern
Mr Starbuck look at the binnacle watch and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers then brace forward again and let the ship sail as before
Hurriedly turning with averted face he descended into his cabin leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit
Soon the two ships diverged their wakes and long as the strange vessel was in view she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot however small on the sea
No no no ye have not a whole body sir do ye but use poor me for your one lost leg only tread upon me sir I ask no more so I remain a part of ye
What an odd feeling now when a black boys host to white men with gold lace upon their coatsMonsieurs have ye seen one Pipa little negro lad five feet high hangdog look and cowardly
But here Ill stay though this stern strikes rocks and they bulge through and oysters come to join me
As the unsetting polar star which through the livelong arctic six months night sustains its piercing steady central gaze so Ahabs purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew
It domineered above them so that all their bodings doubts misgivings fears were fain to hide beneath their souls and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf
Like machines they dumbly moved about the deck ever conscious that the old mans despot eye was on them
But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours when he thought no glance but one was on him then you would have seen that even as Ahabs eyes so awed the crews the inscrutable Parsees glance awed his or somehow at least in some wild way at times affected it
Such an added gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now such ceaseless shudderings shook him that the men looked dubious at him half uncertain as it seemed whether indeed he were a mortal substance or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen beings body
The clothes that the night had wet the next days sunshine dried upon him and so day after day and night after night he went no more beneath the planks whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for
He ate in the same open air that is his two only mealsbreakfast and dinner supper he never touched nor reaped his beard which darkly grew all gnarled as unearthed roots of trees blown over which still grow idly on at naked base though perished in the upper verdure
At times for longest hours without a single hail they stood far parted in the starlight Ahab in his scuttle the Parsee by the mainmast but still fixedly gazing upon each other as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance
And yet somehow did Ahabin his own proper self as daily hourly and every instant commandingly revealed to his subordinatesAhab seemed an independent lord the Parsee but his slave
Still again both seemed yoked together and an unseen tyrant driving them the lean shade siding the solid rib
At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn his iron voice was heard from aftMan the mastheadsand all through the day till after sunset and after twilight the same voice every hour at the striking of the helmsmans bell was heardWhat dye seesharp sharp
But when three or four days had slided by after meeting the childrenseeking Rachel and no spout had yet been seen the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crews fidelity at least of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers he seemed to doubt even whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought
Ahab must have the doubloon and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines and sending a hand aloft with a single sheaved block to secure to the mainmast head he received the two ends of the downwardreeved rope and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end in order to fasten it at the rail
This done with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin he looked round upon his crew sweeping from one to the other pausing his glance long upon Daggoo Queequeg Tashtego but shunning Fedallah and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate saidTake the rope sirI give it into thy hands Starbuck
And thus with one hand clinging round the royal mast Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and milesahead astern this side and thatwithin the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height
Now the first time Ahab was perched aloft ere he had been there ten minutes one of those redbilled savage seahawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mastheads of whalemen in these latitudes one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings
But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon Ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have marked it much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight
Your hat your hat sir suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman who being posted at the mizenmasthead stood directly behind Ahab though somewhat lower than his level and with a deep gulf of air dividing them
But already the sable wing was before the old mans eyes the long hooked bill at his head with a scream the black hawk darted away with his prize
Ahabs hat was never restored the wild hawk flew on and on with it far in advance of the prow and at last disappeared while from the point of that disappearance a minute black spot was dimly discerned falling from that vast height into the sea
The intense Pequod sailed on the rolling waves and days went by the lifebuoycoffin still lightly swung and another ship most miserably misnamed the Delight was descried
Hast seen the White Whale
Tempered in blood and tempered by lightning are these barbs and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin where the White Whale most feels his accursed life
As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight the strange lifebuoy hanging at the Pequods stern came into conspicuous relief
It was a clear steelblue day
Hither and thither on high glided the snowwhite wings of small unspeckled birds these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air but to and fro in the deeps far down in the bottomless blue rushed mighty leviathans swordfish and sharks and these were the strong troubled murderous thinkings of the masculine sea
Aloft like a royal czar and king the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea even as bride to groom
And at the girdling line of the horizon a soft and tremulous motionmost seen here at the Equatordenoted the fond throbbing trust the loving alarms with which the poor bride gave her bosom away
Tied up and twisted gnarled and knotted with wrinkles haggardly firm and unyielding his eyes glowing like coals that still glow in the ashes of ruin untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girls forehead of heaven
Starbuck saw the old man saw him how he heavily leaned over the side and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around
Forty years of continual whaling forty years of privation and peril and stormtime forty years on the pitiless sea for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep
When I think of this life I have led the desolation of solitude it has been the masoned walledtown of a Captains exclusiveness which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country withoutoh weariness heaviness
Oh Starbuck is it not hard that with this weary load I bear one poor leg should have been snatched from under me
Here brush this old hair aside it blinds me that I seem to weep
Close stand close to me Starbuck let me look into a human eye it is better than to gaze into sea or sky better than to gaze upon God
By the green land by the bright hearthstone this is the magic glass man I see my wife and my child in thine eye
What is it what nameless inscrutable unearthly thing is it what cozening hidden lord and master and cruel remorseless emperor commands me that against all natural lovings and longings I so keep pushing and crowding and jamming myself on all the time recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper natural heart I durst not so much as dare
Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side but started at two reflected fixed eyes in the water there
Fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail
That night in the midwatch when the old manas his wont at intervalsstepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned and went to his pivothole he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ships dog will in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle
The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead smooth as oil and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it the polished metalliclike marks of some swift tiderip at the mouth of a deep rapid stream
All sail being set he now cast loose the lifeline reserved for swaying him to the main royalmast head and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither when while but two thirds of the way aloft and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the maintopsail and topgallantsail he raised a gulllike cry in the air
Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three lookouts the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing
Ahab had now gained his final perch some feet above the other lookouts Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the topgallantmast so that the Indians head was almost on a level with Ahabs heel
To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans
Not the same instant not the sameno the doubloon is mine Fate reserved the doubloon for me
I only none of ye could have raised the White Whale first
There againthere again he cried in longdrawn lingering methodic tones attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whales visible jets
A pale deathglimmer lit up Fedallahs sunken eyes a hideous motion gnawed his mouth
At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing and continually set in a revolving ring of finest fleecy greenish foam
Before it far out on the soft Turkishrugged waters went the glistening white shadow from his broad milky forehead a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade and behind the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side
A gentle joyousnessa mighty mildness of repose in swiftness invested the gliding whale
Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns his lovely leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid with smooth bewitching fleetness rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete not Jove not that great majesty Supreme did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam
On each soft sidecoincident with the parted swell that but once leaving him then flowed so wide awayon each bright side the whale shed off enticings
And thus through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea among waves whose handclappings were suspended by exceeding rapture Moby Dick moved on still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw
But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch like Virginias Natural Bridge and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air the grand god revealed himself sounded and went out of sight
Hoveringly halting and dipping on the wing the white seafowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left
It was only an instant for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle
In long Indian file as when herons take wing the white birds were now all flying towards Ahabs boat and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there wheeling round and round with joyous expectant cries
But suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying as it rose till it turned and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white glistening teeth floating up from the undiscoverable bottom
The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an opendoored marble tomb and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition
Through and through through every plank and each rib it thrilled for an instant the whale obliquely lying on his back in the manner of a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth so that the long narrow scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air and one of the teeth caught in a rowlock
The bluish pearlwhite of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahabs head and reached higher than that
In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse
As now he thus vainly strove the jaw slipped from him the frail gunwales bent in collapsed and snapped as both jaws like an enormous shears sliding further aft bit the craft completely in twain and locked themselves fast again in the sea midway between the two floating wrecks
At that preluding moment ere the boat was yet snapped Ahab the first to perceive the whales intent by the crafty upraising of his head a movement that loosed his hold for the time at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite
The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochuss elephants in the book of Maccabees
For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whales aspect and so planetarily swift the evercontracting circles he made that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them
And though the other boats unharmed still hovered hard by still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways Ahab and all nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape
With straining eyes then they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone whose centre had now become the old mans head
But struggling out of it again and chancing to rise on a towering crest he shoutedSail on the whaleDrive him off
The Pequods prows were pointed and breaking up the charmed circle she effectually parted the white whale from his victim
Dragged into Stubbs boat with bloodshot blinded eyes the white brine caking in his wrinkles the long tension of Ahabs bodily strength did crack and helplessly he yielded to his bodys doom for a time lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubbs boat like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants
In an instants compass great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler mens whole lives
And so such hearts though summary in each one suffering still if the gods decree it in their lifetime aggregate a whole age of woe wholly made up of instantaneous intensities for even in their pointless centres those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls
At the well known methodic intervals the whales glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mastheads and when he would be reported as just gone down Ahab would take the time and then pacing the deck binnaclewatch in hand so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired his voice was heardWhose is the doubloon now
At last he paused before it and as in an already overclouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across so over the old mans face there now stole some such added gloom as this
Stubb saw him pause and perhaps intending not vainly though to evince his own unabated fortitude and thus keep up a valiant place in his Captains mind he advanced and eyeing the wreck exclaimedThe thistle the ass refused it pricked his mouth too keenly sir ha ha
Aye sir said Starbuck drawing near tis a solemn sight an omen and an ill one
If the gods think to speak outright to man they will honourably speak outright not shake their heads and give an old wives darkling hintBegone
Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing Starbuck is Stubb reversed and Stubb is Starbuck and ye two are all mankind and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth nor gods nor men his neighbors
Dye see him cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to spread
Here be it said that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale continued through day into night and through night into day is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery
So that to this hunters wondrous skill the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water a wake is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land
By salt and hemp cried Stubb but this swift motion of the deck creeps up ones legs and tingles at the heart
Aye aye cried Stubb I knew itye cant escapeblow on and split your spout O whale the mad fiend himself is after ye blow your trumpblister your lungsAhab will dam off your blood as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream
Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab but they were broken up and on all sides routed as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison
The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls and by the stirring perils of the previous day the rack of the past nights suspense the fixed unfearing blind reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark by all these things their hearts were bowled along
Clinging to a spar with one hand some reached forth the other with impatient wavings others shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight sat far out on the rocking yards all the spars in full bearing of mortals ready and ripe for their fate
It was even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistaken some other thing for the whalespout as the event itself soon proved for hardly had Ahab reached his perch hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck when he struck the keynote to an orchestra that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles
The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard asmuch nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet less than a mile aheadMoby Dick bodily burst into view
For not by any calm and indolent spoutings not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching
Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more
There she breaches there she breaches was the cry as in his immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmonlike to Heaven
So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky the spray that he raised for the moment intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale
Unmindful of the tedious ropeladders of the shrouds the men like shooting stars slid to the deck by the isolated backstays and halyards while Ahab less dartingly but still rapidly was dropped from his perch
As if to strike a quick terror into them by this time being the first assailant himself Moby Dick had turned and was now coming for the three crews
Ahabs boat was central and cheering his men he told them he would take the whale headandheadthat is pull straight up to his foreheada not uncommon thing for when within a certain limit such a course excludes the coming onset from the whales sidelong vision
But skilfully manoeuvred incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field the boats for a while eluded him though at times but by a planks breadth while all the time Ahabs unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds
But at last in his untraceable evolutions the White Whale so crossed and recrossed and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him that they foreshortened and of themselves warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little as if to rally for a more tremendous charge
Seizing that opportunity Ahab first paid out more line and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it againhoping that way to disencumber it of some snarlswhen loa sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks
As before the attentive ship having descried the whole fight again came bearing down to the rescue and dropping a boat picked up the floating mariners tubs oars and whatever else could be caught at and safely landed them on her decks
As with Fedallah the day before so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boats broken half which afforded a comparatively easy float nor did it so exhaust him as the previous days mishap
Up helm then pile on the sail again ship keepers down the rest of the spare boats and rig themMr
Accursed fate that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate
The old mans hinted thought was true
The harpoon tootoss over the litter theredye see itthe forged iron men the white whalesno no noblistered fool this hand did dart ittis in the fishAloft there
Two days chased twice stove to splinters thy very leg once more snatched from under thee thy evil shadow goneall good angels mobbing thee with warnings What more wouldst thou haveShall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man
Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world
This whole acts immutably decreed
Ye see an old man cut down to the stump leaning on a shivered lance propped up on a lonely foot
Oh how valiantly I seek to drive out of others hearts whats clinched so fast in mineThe Parseethe Parseegone gone and he was to go beforebut still was to be seen again ere I could perishHows thatTheres a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of judgeslike a hawks beak it pecks my brain
So once more the sail was shortened and everything passed nearly as on the previous night only the sound of hammers and the hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow
The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh and once more the solitary nightman at the foremasthead was relieved by crowds of the daylight lookouts who dotted every mast and almost every spar
And yet Ive sometimes thought my brain was very calmfrozen calm this old skull cracks so like a glass in which the contents turned to ice and shiver it
And still this hair is growing now this moment growing and heat must breed it but no its like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava
How the wild winds blow it they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to
A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells and wards of hospitals and ventilated them and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces
Ha a coward wind that strikes stark naked men but will not stand to receive a single blow
These warm Trade Winds at least that in the clear heavens blow straight on in strong and steadfast vigorous mildness and veer not from their mark however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift and swerve about uncertain where to go at last
And by the eternal Poles these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on these Trades or something like themsomething so unchangeable and full as strong blow my keeled soul along
Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw murmured Starbuck to himself as he coiled the newhauled mainbrace upon the rail
A whole hour now passed goldbeaten out to ages
Theres a soft shower to leeward
Leeward the white whale goes that way look to windward then the better if the bitterer quarter
By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way
Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea supposing I descend those endless stairs and all night Ive been sailing from him wherever he did sink to
Goodbye mastheadkeep a good eye upon the whale the while Im gone
Well talk tomorrow nay tonight when the white whale lies down there tied by head and tail
Oh my captain my captainnoble heartgo notgo notsee its a brave man that weeps how great the agony of the persuasion then
The sharks the sharks cried a voice from the low cabinwindow there O master my master come back
Yet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the ship when numbers of sharks seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars every time they dipped in the water and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites
See ye my boys hand on the hillCrazedaloft therekeep thy keenest eye upon the boats Mark well the whaleHo againdrive off that hawk see he peckshe tears the vanepointing to the red flag flying at the maintruckHa he soars away with itWheres the old man now seest thou that sight oh Ahabshudder shudder
A low rumbling sound was heard a subterraneous hum and then all held their breaths as bedraggled with trailing ropes and harpoons and lances a vast form shot lengthwise but obliquely from the sea
The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knitted together as head on he came churning his tail among the boats and once more flailed them apart spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates boats and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows but leaving Ahabs almost without a scar
While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks and as the whale swimming out from them turned and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again at that moment a quick cry went up
Lashed round and round to the fishs back pinioned in the turns upon turns in which during the past night the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him the half torn body of the Parsee was seen his sable raiment frayed to shreds his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab
But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word
Whether fagged by the three days running chase and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him whichever was true the White Whales way now began to abate as it seemed from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more though indeed the whales last start had not been so long a one as before
But at every bite sir the thin blades grow smaller and smaller
As it was three of the oarsmenwho foreknew not the precise instant of the dart and were therefore unprepared for its effectsthese were flung out but so fell that in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again and rising to its level on a combing wave hurled themselves bodily inboard again the third man helplessly dropping astern but still afloat and swimming
Almost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduated instantaneous swiftness the White Whale darted through the weltering sea
But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line and hold it so and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug it snapped in the empty air
Meantime for that one beholding instant Tashtegos masthead hammer remained suspended in his hand and the red flag halfwrapping him as with a plaid then streamed itself straight out from him as his own forwardflowing heart while Starbuck and Stubb standing upon the bowsprit beneath caught sight of the downcoming monster just as soon as he
A most mouldy and over salted death thoughcherries cherries cherries
Diving beneath the settling ship the whale ran quivering along its keel but turning under water swiftly shot to the surface again far off the other bow but within a few yards of Ahabs boat where for a time he lay quiescent
Towards thee I roll thou alldestroying but unconquering whale to the last I grapple with thee from hells heart I stab at thee for hates sake I spit my last breath at thee
Next instant the heavy eyesplice in the ropes final end flew out of the starkempty tub knocked down an oarsman and smiting the sea disappeared in its depths
Soon they through dim bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom as in the gaseous Fata Morgana only the uppermost masts out of water while fixed by infatuation or fidelity or fate to their once lofty perches the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea
And now concentric circles seized the lone boat itself and all its crew and each floating oar and every lancepole and spinning animate and inanimate all round and round in one vortex carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight
It so chanced that after the Parsees disappearance I was he whom the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahabs bowsman when that bowsman assumed the vacant post the same who when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat was dropped astern
When I reached it it had subsided to a creamy pool
Till gaining that vital centre the black bubble upward burst and now liberated by reason of its cunning spring and owing to its great buoyancy rising with great force the coffin lifebuoy shot lengthwise from the sea fell over and floated by my side
The unharming sharks they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths the savage seahawks sailed with sheathed beaks

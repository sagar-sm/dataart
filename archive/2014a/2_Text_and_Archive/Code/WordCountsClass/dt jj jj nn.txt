Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea
The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us
As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may as well be related that I for one had no idea of so doing
It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet
Moving on I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray and these words underneathThe Spouter InnPeter Coffin
It stood on a sharp bleak corner where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Pauls tossed craft
Euroclydon nevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one indoors with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed
What a fine frosty night how Orion glitters what northern lights
Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights
On one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of the neighbors that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose
Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the New England hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched
With this once long lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset
Crossing this dusky entry and on through yon lowarched waycut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all roundyou enter the public room
Be that how it may there stands the vast arched bone of the whales jaw so wide a coach might almost drive beneath it
But the fare was of the most substantial kindnot only meat and potatoes but dumplings good heavens dumplings for supper
The devil fetch that harpooneer thought I but stop couldnt I steal a march on himbolt his door inside and jump into his bed not to be wakened by the most violent knockings
This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling mebut at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators
There said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a washstand and centre table there make yourself comfortable now and good night to ye
As I live these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face his back too was all over the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years War and just escaped from it with a stickingplaster shirt
All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee who seemed to be praying in a singsong or else singing some pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner
When I was a child I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me whether it was a reality or a dream I never could entirely settle
For what seemed ages piled on ages I lay there frozen with the most awful fears not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be broken
Thinks I Queequeg under the circumstances this is a very civilized overture but the truth is these savages have an innate sense of delicacy say what you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are
At last he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes and began creaking and limping about the room as if not being much accustomed to boots his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide onesprobably not made to order eitherrather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning
I was watching to see where he kept his razor when lo and behold he takes the harpoon from the bed corner slips out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets it a little on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall begins a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of his cheeks
Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept
However a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a good thing the mores the pity
Not always though Ledyard the great New England traveller and Mungo Park the Scotch one of all men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor
In this same New Bedford there stands a Whalemans Chapel and few are the moody fishermen shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot
I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered immediately as the stormpelted door flew back upon admitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain
Yes it was the famous Father Mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he was a very great favourite
At the time I now write of Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth for among all the fissures of his wrinkles there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloomthe spring verdure peeping forth even beneath Februarys snow
Cadiz is in Spain as far by water from Joppa as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea
Through all his unearthly tattooings I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart and in his large deep eyes fiery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils
Thus I soon engaged his interest and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town
So I kindled the shavings helped prop up the innocent little idol offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg salamed before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and that done we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own consciences and all the world
I was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend
Upon this I told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from
The people of his island of Rokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held
Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko and its commanderfrom all accounts a very stately punctilious gentleman at least for a sea captainthis commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequegs sister a pretty young princess just turned of ten
Dropping his harpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arms and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength sent him high up bodily into the air then slightly tapping his stern in midsomerset the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet while Queequeg turning his back upon him lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff
Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the redmen
Setting out in their canoes after a perilous passage they discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory casketthe poor little Indians skeleton
I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn under a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured eye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt
However a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us
I have forgotten to mention that in many things Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojos judgment and surprising forecast of things and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem as a rather good sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs
You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught I knowsquaretoed luggers mountainous Japanese junks butterbox galliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod
All round her unpanelled open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for pins to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to
Planted with their broad ends on the deck a circle of these slabs laced together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex united in a tufted point where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the topknot on some old Pottowottamie Sachems head
He was seated on an oldfashioned oaken chair wriggling all over with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed
Now Bildad I am sorry to say had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks and in his seagoing days a bitter hard taskmaster
I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling my own lay would not be very large but considering that I was used to the sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th laythat is the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage whatever that might eventually amount to
It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortuneand so it was a very poor way indeed
And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands especially as I now found him on board the Pequod quite at home there in the cabin and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside
And once for all let me tell thee and assure thee young man its better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one
As I walked away I was full of thoughtfulness what had been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him
However my thoughts were at length carried in other directions so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind
There was Queequeg now certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadanbut what of that
But previous to turning in I took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him as it promised to be a very cold night and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on
He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety
I mean sir the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I and Captain Peleg there and Queequeg here and all of us and every mothers son and soul of us belong the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world we all belong to that only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief in THAT we all join hands
Elijah thought I and we walked away both commenting after each others fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear
Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildads sister a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit but withal very kindhearted who seemed resolved that if SHE could help it nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod after once fairly getting to sea
No no no I wasnt aware of that said Elijah slowly and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg with the most unaccountable glances
Meantime overseeing the other part of the ship Captain Peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner
I was comforting myself however with the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation spite of his seven hundred and seventyseventh lay when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear and turning round was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity
It was a short cold Christmas and as the short northern day merged into night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose freezing spray cased us in ice as in polished armor
When on that shivering winters night the Pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves who should I see standing at her helm but Bulkington
If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits were he presented to the company as a harpooneer say and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials SWF
I freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot for his life point out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world taken in one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling
In one of the mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the worlds capital the bones of a whale brought all the way from the Syrian coast were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession See subsequent chapters for something more on this head
It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens even modern ones a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through
Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman and endued with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition but to that sort of superstition which in some organizations seems rather to spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance
A happygolucky neither craven nor valiant taking perils as they came with an indifferent air and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase toiling away calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year
He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster
Yes their supreme lord and dictator was there though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin
Yet this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived by what a grey Manxman insinuated an old sepulchral man who having never before sailed out of Nantucket had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab
So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me and the livid brand which streaked it that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood
As the sky grew less gloomy indeed began to grow a little genial he became still less and less a recluse as if when the ship had sailed from home nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded
For as when the redcheeked dancing girls April and May trip home to the wintry misanthropic woods even the barest ruggedest most thundercloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts to welcome such gladhearted visitants so Ahab did in the end a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air
Inward they turned upon the soul especially when the still mild hours of eve came on then memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights
A hot old man
Besides thinks I look at it once why the end of itthe foot partwhat a small sort of end it is whereas if a broad footed farmer kicked me THERES a devilish broad insult
Of the names in this list of whale authors only those following Owen ever saw living whales and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman
Yet owing to the long priority of his claims and the profound ignorance which till some seventy years back invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown spermwhale and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whaleports this usurpation has been every way complete
But they precisely agree in all their grand features nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction
It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate
Though no coward he has never yet shown any part of him but his back which rises in a long sharp ridge
But possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan most naturalists have recognised him for one
Concerning the officers of the whalecraft this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on shipboard arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whalefleet
But Ahab my Captain still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness and shagginess and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whalehunter like him and therefore all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me
Over his ivoryinlaid table Ahab presided like a mute maned sealion on the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs
In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captains table was the entire carefree license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers
And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages DoughBoys whole life was one continual lipquiver
In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the masthead nay to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful
Concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mastheads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits called CROWSNESTS in which the lookouts of a Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas
He called it the SLEETS CROWSNEST in honour of himself he being the original inventor and patentee and free from all ridiculous false delicacy and holding that if we call our own children after our own names we fathers being the original inventors and patentees so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget
The hours wore onAhab now shut up within his cabin anon pacing the deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect
Look ye dye see this Spanish ounce of goldholding up a broad bright coin to the sunit is a sixteen dollar piece men
It seemed as though by some nameless interior volition he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic life
Blood but that old mans a grand old cove
Aye harpooneer thy race is the undeniable dark side of mankinddevilish dark at that
Oh thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness have mercy on this small black boy down here preserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear
For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible eventsas the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi but in maritime life far more than in that of terra firma wild rumors abound wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to
The rest of his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with the same shrouded hue that in the end he had gained his distinctive appellation of the White Whale a name indeed literally justified by his vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea leaving a milkyway wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden gleamings
The Romish mass for the dead begins with Requiem eternam eternal rest whence REQUIEM denominating the mass itself and any other funeral music
Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly which so clothed him with divineness and that this divineness had that in it which though commanding worship at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror
How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in Froissart when masked in the snowy symbol of their faction the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the marketplace
Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms all ghosts rising in a milkwhite fogYea while these terrors seize us let us add that even the king of terrors when personified by the evangelist rides on his pallid horse
Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings which will not wholly account for it that makes the White Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled American than those other storied structures its neighborsthe Byward Tower or even the Bloody
Or to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance purely addressed to the fancy why in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe does the tall pale man of the Hartz forests whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groveswhy is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg
Tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peaceful valley of Vermont far removed from all beasts of preywhy is it that upon the sunniest day if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him so that he cannot even see it but only smells its wild animal muskinesswhy will he start snort and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright
Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts spread them before him on his screweddown table
So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen for example on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast yet it did not follow that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season she would infallibly encounter him there
But granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it not but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary whale even if encountered should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter even as a whitebearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople
First I have personally known three instances where a whale after receiving a harpoon has effected a complete escape and after an interval in one instance of three years has been again struck by the same hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the same private cypher have been taken from the body
Ere long several of the whales were wounded when suddenly a very large whale escaping from the boats issued from the shoal and bore directly down upon the ship
An uncommon large whale the body of which was larger than the ship itself lay almost at the surface of the water but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship which was in full sail was almost upon him so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him
We were thus placed in the most imminent danger as this gigantic creature setting up its back raised the ship three feet at least out of the water
He knew for example that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over Starbuck yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation
The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man thought Ahab is sordidness
Granting that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knighterrantism in them still while for the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick they must also have food for their more common daily appetites
They may scorn cash now but let some months go by and no perspective promise of it to them and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash would soon cashier Ahab
A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff
He would say the most terrific things to his crew in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing
Likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea
How different the loud little KingPost
There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns and more than suspects that the joke is at nobodys expense but his own
There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod and the great White Whale its object
Besides all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be
Oh hes a wonderful old man
This midnightspout had almost grown a forgotten thing when some days after lo at the same silent hour it was again announced again it was descried by all but upon making sail to overtake it once more it disappeared as if it had never been
And heaved and heaved still unrestingly heaved the black sea as if its vast tides were a conscience and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred
During all this blackness of the elements Ahab though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldom than ever addressed his mates
There seemed but little in the words but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced
For the long absent ship the outwardbounder perhaps has letters on board at any rate she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumbworn files
Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference that is so long as both parties speak one language as is the case with Americans and English
But this is a harmless little foible in the English whalehunters which the Nantucketer does not take much to heart probably because he knows that he has a few foibles himself
Nevertheless this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees
In a pirate manofwar or slave ship when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable sometimes cushioned seat there and often steers himself with a pretty little milliners tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons
And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs
Nor is this any very easy matter for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back the afteroar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front
Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about rehearsing to you gentlemen the TownHo Sperm Whaler of Nantucket was cruising in your Pacific here not very many days sail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn
Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward gentlemen is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pumphandles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length that is if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them
But hes a simple old soulRad and a beauty too
Besides it was the stronger men in the TownHo that had been divided into gangs taking turns at the pumps and being the most athletic seaman of them all Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties such being the case with his comrades
Freely depicted in his own vocation gentlemen the Canaller would make a fine dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he
Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian cornfield and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas I see
But the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two they swore they were ready for that or for any other mad thing for anything in short but a surrender
There headed by the Lakeman all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms eventually as it turned out seizing a large double warcanoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harbor
Chartering a small native schooner he returned with them to his vessel and finding all right there again resumed his cruisings
It may be worth while therefore previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman
The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda all the trades and pursuits every conceivable avocation of man were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being
Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousness of mistake
True one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness
The halfemptied linetub floats on the whitened sea the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene
With the same marvellous patience and with the same single sharks tooth of his one poor jackknife he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture not quite as workmanlike but as close packed in its maziness of design as the Greek savage Achilless shield and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage Albert Durer
Wooden whales or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble South Sea warwood are frequently met with in the forecastles of American whalers
For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea and though taking a broad general view of the thing this may very well be yet coming to specialties where for example does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog
In the distance a great white mass lazily rose and rising higher and higher and disentangling itself from the azure at last gleamed before our prow like a snowslide new slid from the hills
Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind
So rarely is it beheld that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form notwithstanding they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food
When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the American linetub the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great weddingcake to present to the whales
Though apparently the most massive it is by far the most buoyant part about him
And all the while jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman as at every dart hauling in upon his crooked lance by the line attached to it Stubb straightened it again and again by a few rapid blows against the gunwale then again and again sent it into the whale
Nevertheless as the second iron is already connected with the line and the line is running hence that weapon must at all events be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat somehow and somewhere else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands
Cook said Stubb rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth dont you think this steak is rather overdone
Whereupon this accomplished swordsman warning all hands to stand off once more makes a scientific dash at the mass and with a few sidelong desperate lunging slicings severs it completely in twain so that while the short lower part is still fast the long upper strip called a blanketpiece swings clear and is all ready for lowering
Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents he not seldom displays the back and more especially his flanks effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance by reason of numerous rude scratches altogether of an irregular random aspect
It does seem to me that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality and the rare virtue of thick walls and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness
For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen
Now the beheading of the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves and not without reason
And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower masthead and every yardarm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves there that blooddripping head hung to the Pequods waist like the giant Holoferness from the girdle of Judith
An intense copper calm like a universal yellow lotus was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea
Subject to this and other the like interruptions now and then a conversation was sustained between the two parties but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort
Now while Macey the mate was standing up in his boats bow and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance lo a broad white shadow rose from the sea by its quick fanning motion temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen
For the present other matters press and the best we can do now for the head is to pray heaven the tackles may hold
In disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside the ship the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cut off whole but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crownpiece
Both are massive enough in all conscience but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whales which the Right Whales sadly lacks
But come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuffbox with the hinge at one end instead of one side
Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death
Furthermore you are now to consider that only in the extreme lower backward sloping part of the front of the head is there the slightest vestige of bone and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development
So that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad
Finally though as will soon be revealed its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil yet you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy
Unerringly impelling this dead impregnable uninjurable wall and this most buoyant thing within there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life only to be adequately estimated as piled wood isby the cord and all obedient to one volition as the smallest insect
But to comprehend it aright you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon
It belongs to the pure nautical mathematics
These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian to whom another person has reached up a very long pole
He averred that upon first thrusting in for him a leg was presented but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be and might occasion great troublehe had thrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave and toss had wrought a somerset upon the Indian so that with the next trial he came forth in the good old wayhead foremost
Now had Tashtego perished in that head it had been a very precious perishing smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti coffined hearsed and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale
In thought a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the morning
If hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure back to their birthright the merry Mayday gods of old and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted hill then be sure exalted to Joves high seat the great Sperm Whale shall lord it
Physiognomy like every other human science is but a passing fable
And by those negations considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power you can best form to yourself the truest though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is
But the curious external resemblance I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive
For viewed in this light the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord
They left a great wide wake as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea
Full in this rapid wake and many fathoms in the rear swam a huge humped old bull which by his comparatively slow progress as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him seemed afflicted with the jaundice or some other infirmity
With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish because not only was he the largest and therefore the most valuable whale but he was nearest to them and the other whales were going with such great velocity moreover as almost to defy pursuit for the time
Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequods boats the advantage and rather than be thus foiled of his game Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart ere the last chance would for ever escape
We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under even here aboveground in the air how vast then the burden of a whale bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean
As the boats now more closely surrounded him the whole upper part of his form with much of it that is ordinarily submerged was plainly revealed
But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales with the flesh perfectly healed around them and no prominence of any kind to denote their place therefore there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to
Now this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a very curious thing nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it
If the only whales that thus sank were old meagre and brokenhearted creatures their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him
Thus then one of our own noble stamp even a whaleman is the tutelary guardian of England and by good rights we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St George
Next moment with a rapid nameless impulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance and quivers in the life spot of the whale
If I say that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle I do not think I shall err though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words
The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true seems the more cogent to me when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT as the fishermen phrase it
The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it when always when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout he is in a prodigious commotion the water cascading all around him
And besides other reasons to this conclusion I am impelled by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale I account him no common shallow being inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings or near shores all other whales sometimes are
And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings such as Plato Pyrrho the Devil Jupiter Dante and so on there always goes up a certain semivisible steam while in the act of thinking deep thoughts
And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty misty monster to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea his vast mild head overhung by a canopy of vapour engendered by his incommunicable contemplations and that vapouras you will sometimes see itglorified by a rainbow as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts
Your only salvation lies in eluding it but if it comes sideways through the opposing water then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale boat and the elasticity of its materials a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two a sort of stitch in the side is generally the most serious result
This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea and if he feel but a sailors whisker woe to that sailor whiskers and all
In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra Java Bally and Timor which with many others form a vast mole or rampart lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes
Unlike the straight perpendicular twinjets of the Right Whale which dividing at top fall over in two branches like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow the single forwardslanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist continually rising and falling away to leeward
Seen from the Pequods deck then as she would rise on a high hill of the sea this host of vapoury spouts individually curling up into the air and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis descried of a balmy autumnal morning by some horseman on a height
The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming were now broken up in one measureless rout and like King Porus elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander they seemed going mad with consternation
But upon flinging the third in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block it caught under one of the seats of the boat and in an instant tore it out and carried it away dropping the oarsman in the boats bottom as the seat slid from under him
And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles and saw successive pods of whales eight or ten in each swiftly going round and round like multiplied spans of horses in a ring and so closely shoulder to shoulder that a Titanic circusrider might easily have overarched the middle ones and so have gone round on their backs
Now inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles the entire area at this juncture embraced by the whole multitude must have contained at least two or three square miles
By the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year
When serenely advancing on one of these journeys if any strange suspicious sights are seen my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family

As ashore the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers just so with the whales who sometimes come to deadly battle and all for love
True among the more upright and honourable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party
Now as this law under a modified form is to this day in force in England and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and LooseFish it is here treated of in a separate chapter on the same courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate car specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty
Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies bodices
Yet are there those who will still do it notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality and by no means of the nature of attarofrose
Drawing across her bow he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste the upper part of her stempiece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk was painted green and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour
Now this ambergris is a very curious substance and so important as an article of commerce that in 1791 a certain Nantucketborn Captain Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject
Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay is this nothing
It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequods crew an event most lamentable and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own

It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example of these things
Now it is no very easy matter for anybodyexcept those who are almost hourly used to it like whalemento clamber up a ships side from a boat on the open sea for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson
It has before been hinted perhaps that every little untoward circumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab
As good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous and the great tackles were still aloft and the massive curved blubberhook now clean and dry was still attached to the end
Seeing how matters stood and what a noble great whale it wasthe noblest and biggest I ever saw sir in my lifeI resolved to capture him spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in
It was a shocking bad wound began the whalesurgeon and taking my advice Captain Boomer here stood our old Sammy Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship interrupted the onearmed captain addressing Ahab go on boy

So Owen rechristened the monster Zeuglodon and in his paper read before the London Geological Society pronounced it in substance one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence
But upon investigation we find that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary system embracing a distinct geological period prior to man but of the whales found in that Tertiary system those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones
But may it not be that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods may it not be that since Adams time they have degenerated
And what that is we may soon gain some idea of by imagining all the graveyards cemeteries and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men women and children who were alive seventyfive years ago and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe
To trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods so that in the face of all the glad haymaking suns and soft cymballing round harvestmoons we must needs give in to this that the gods themselves are not for ever glad
Yet was this halfhorrible stolidity in him involving too as it appeared an allramifying heartlessnessyet was it oddly dashed at times with an old crutchlike antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noahs ark

And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the Japanese islandsNiphon Matsmai and Sikoke
With his snowwhite new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table and with a long pruninghook of a jackknife in his hand the wondrous old man with his back to the gangway door was wrinkling his brow and tracing his old courses again
It may have been a flash of honesty in him or mere prudential policy which under the circumstance imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection however transient in the important chief officer of his ship
There was some heathenish coffincoloured old lumber aboard which upon a long previous voyage had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made
So in good time my Queequeg gained strength and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days but eating with a vigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his feet threw out his arms and legs gave himself a good stretching yawned a little bit and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat and poising a harpoon pronounced himself fit for a fight

You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille such wild cries they raised as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea
And Ahab he too was standing on his quarterdeck shaggy and black with a stubborn gloom and as the two ships crossed each others wakesone all jubilations for things passed the other all forebodings as to things to cometheir two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene
Soothed again but only soothed to deeper gloom Ahab who had sterned off from the whale sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat

Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old mans tormented sleep as if Starbucks voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak
Long maintaining an enchanted silence Ahab stood apart and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye the bright suns rays produced ahead and when she profoundly settled by the stern he turned behind and saw the suns rearward place and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake
Then going through some small strange motions with itwhether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew is uncertainhe called for linen thread and moving to the binnacle slipped out the two reversed needles there and horizontally suspended the sailneedle by its middle over one of the compasscards
In the little rocky Isle of Man sir
Making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters descrying no ships and ere long sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds over waves monotonously mild all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene

Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains
Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides then all collapsed and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago

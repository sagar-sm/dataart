Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself
Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk the undeliverable nameless perils of the whale these with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds helped to sway me to my wish
By reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome the great floodgates of the wonderworld swung open and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into my inmost soul endless processions of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air
Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her yet Nantucket was her great originalthe Tyre of this Carthagethe place where the first dead American whale was stranded
Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen the RedMen first sally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan
And where but from Nantucket too did that first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with imported cobblestonesso goes the storyto throw at the whales in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit
The picture represents a CapeHorner in a great hurricane the halffoundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mastheads
With this once long lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset
And that harpoonso like a corkscrew nowwas flung in Javan seas and run away with by a whale years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco
Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a darklooking denthe bara rude attempt at a right whales head
Be that how it may there stands the vast arched bone of the whales jaw so wide a coach might almost drive beneath it
No wonder then that they made a straight wake for the whales mouththe barwhen the wrinkled little old Jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round
I then glanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four walls and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale
I remembered a story of a white mana whaleman toowho falling among the cannibals had been tattooed by them
It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas and so landed in this Christian country
They were nearly all whalemen chief mates and second mates and third mates and sea carpenters and sea coopers and sea blacksmiths and harpooneers and ship keepers a brown and brawny company with bosky beards an unshorn shaggy set all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns
A curious sight these bashful bears these timid warrior whalemen
They are mostly young of stalwart frames fellows who have felled forests and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whalelance
Now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation and joins the great whalefishery you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport
Had it not been for us whalemen that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador
In New Bedford fathers they say give whales for dowers to their daughters and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises apiece
In this same New Bedford there stands a Whalemans Chapel and few are the moody fishermen shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG WILLIS ELLERY NATHAN COLEMAN WALTER CANNY SETH MACY AND SAMUEL GLEIG Forming one of the boats crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale On the Offshore Ground in the PACIFIC December 31st 1839
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY Who in the bows of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan AUGUST 3d 1833
It needs scarcely to be told with what feelings on the eve of a Nantucket voyage I regarded those marble tablets and by the murky light of that darkened doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me
Yes it was the famous Father Mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he was a very great favourite
In black distress I called my God When I could scarce believe him mine He bowed his ear to my complaints No more the whale did me confine
Then in that contracted hole sunk too beneath the ships waterline Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels wards
He sees no black sky and raging sea feels not the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him
He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale shootsto all his ivory teeth like so many white bolts upon his prison
And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale
As we have seen God came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom and with swift slantings tore him along into the midst of the seas where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down and the weeds were wrapped about his head and all the watery world of woe bowled over him
Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummetout of the belly of hellwhen the whale grounded upon the oceans utmost bones even then God heard the engulphed repenting prophet when he cried
When a newhatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout followed by the nibbling goats as if he were a green sapling even then in Queequegs ambitious soul lurked a strong desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two
They put him down among the sailors and made a whaleman of him
But alas the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked infinitely more so than all his fathers heathens
Upon this I told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from
To this in substance he replied that though what I hinted was true enough yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it was of assured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales
Kille cried Queequeg twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain ah him bevy smalle fishe Queequeg no kille so smalle fishe Queequeg kille big whale
Nothing was done and nothing seemed capable of being done those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale
With the landless gull that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows so at nightfall the Nantucketer out of sight of land furls his sails and lays him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales
Its ominous thinks I A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port tombstones staring at me in the whalemens chapel and here a gallows and a pair of prodigious black pots too
Why not said I every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoonbut why not
I had not a little relied upon Queequegs sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely
All round her unpanelled open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for pins to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to
It was of a conical shape some ten feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the rightwhale
Was the other one lost by a whale
Lost by a whale
I was a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said as calmly as I could What you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident
Now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whales throat and then jump after it
For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whalehunters
Like Captain Peleg Captain Bildad was a welltodo retired whaleman
They told me in Nantucket though it certainly seems a curious story that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman his crew upon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and worn out
Has he ever whaled it any turning to me
Killed more whales than I can count Captain Peleg
Mark ye be forewarned Ahabs above the common Ahabs been in colleges as well as mong the cannibals been used to deeper wonders than the waves fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes than whales
I know too that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale hes been a kind of moodydesperate moody and savage sometimes but that will all pass off
I say Quohog or whatever your name is did you ever stand in the head of a whaleboat did you ever strike a fish
Without saying a word Queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whaleboats hanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising his harpoon cried out in some such way as this Capain you see him small drop tar on water dere
You see him well spose him one whale eye well den and taking sharp aim at it he darted the iron right over old Bildads broad brim clean across the ships decks and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight
Now said Queequeg quietly hauling in the line sposee him whalee eye why dad whale dead
He got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he shrinked and sheered away from whales for fear of afterclaps in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones
They didnt tell much of anything about him only Ive heard that hes a good whalehunter and a good captain to his crew
And though this also holds true of merchant vessels yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen
Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den roaring at the men down the hatchways roaring up to the riggers at the masthead and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam
As I hinted before this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on board the Pequod for thirty years the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor
Dont whale it too much a Lords days men but dont miss a fair chance either thats rejecting Heavens good gifts
As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit therefore I am all anxiety to convince ye ye landsmen of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales
Sperm Whale Fishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemed preeminently presuming and ridiculous
Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us whalemen is this they think that at best our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business and that when actively engaged therein we are surrounded by all manner of defilements
And as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the sperm whaleship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth
But even granting the charge in question to be true what disordered slippery decks of a whaleship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battlefields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies plaudits
And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldiers profession let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whales vast tail fanning into eddies the air over his head
But though the world scouts at us whale hunters yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage yea an allabounding adoration for almost all the tapers lamps and candles that burn round the globe burn as before so many shrines to our glory
But look at this matter in other lights weigh it in all sorts of scales see what we whalemen are and have been
Why did Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of L1000000
And lastly how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels manned by eighteen thousand men yearly consuming 4000000 of dollars the ships worth at the time of sailing 20000000 and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of 7000000
For many years past the whaleship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth
If American and European menofwar now peacefully ride in once savage harbors let them fire salutes to the honour and glory of the whaleship which originally showed them the way and first interpreted between them and the savages
Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn no commerce but colonial scarcely any intercourse but colonial was carried on between Europe and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast
It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish crown touching those colonies and if space permitted it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru Chili and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts
That great America on the other side of the sphere Australia was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman
After its first blunderborn discovery by a Dutchman all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous but the whaleship touched there
The whaleship is the true mother of that now mighty colony
Moreover in the infancy of the first Australian settlement the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whaleship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters
The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth and do commercial homage to the whaleship that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations
If that doublebolted land Japan is ever to become hospitable it is the whaleship alone to whom the credit will be due for already she is on the threshold
The whale has no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler you will say
THE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER
Who but no less a prince than Alfred the Great who with his own royal pen took down the words from Other the Norwegian whalehunter of those times
True enough but then whalemen themselves are poor devils they have no good blood in their veins
By old English statutory law the whale is declared a royal fish Oh thats only nominal
The whale himself has never figured in any grand imposing way
THE WHALE NEVER FIGURED IN ANY GRAND IMPOSING WAY
In one of the mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the worlds capital the bones of a whale brought all the way from the Syrian coast were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession See subsequent chapters for something more on this head
I know a man that in his lifetime has taken three hundred and fifty whales
Think of that ye loyal Britons we whalemen supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff
I will have no man in my boat said Starbuck who is not afraid of a whale
But we shall ere long see what that word careful precisely means when used by a man like Stubb or almost any other whale hunter
Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sundown nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him
For thought Starbuck I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living and not to be killed by them for theirs and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew
Goodhumored easy and careless he presided over his whaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner and his crew all invited guests
When close to the whale in the very deathlock of the fight he handled his unpitying lance coolly and offhandedly as a whistling tinker his hammer
A short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whales who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him and therefore it was a sort of point of honour with him to destroy them whenever encountered
This ignorant unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales he followed these fish for the fun of it and a three years voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time
They called him KingPost on board of the Pequod because in form he could be well likened to the short square timber known by that name in Arctic whalers and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas
In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales these three headsmen were as captains of companies
But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires
In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler lying in a lonely bay on his native coast
As for the residue of the Pequods company be it said that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the American whale fishery are Americans born though pretty nearly all the officers are
Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as with the American army and military and merchant navies and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the American Canals and Railroads
No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores
In like manner the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London put in at the Shetland Islands to receive the full complement of their crew
How it is there is no telling but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen
It had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whales jaw
In old Norse times the thrones of the sealoving Danish kings were fabricated saith tradition of the tusks of the narwhale
Here have I been unconsciously toiling not pleasuringaye and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while to windward and with such nervous whiffs as if like the dying whale my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble
And thinks I to myself all the while mind while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramidso confoundedly contradictory was it all all the while I say I was thinking to myself whats his leg now but a canea whalebone cane
Yes thinks I it was only a playful cudgellingin fact only a whaleboning that he gave menot a base kick
There are whales hereabouts
A white whaledid ye mark that man
It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera that I would now fain put before you
Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal sperm whale says Surgeon Beale AD 1839
Thus speak of the whale the great Cuvier and John Hunter and Lesson those lights of zoology and anatomy
Nevertheless though of real knowledge there be little yet of books there are a plenty and so in some small degree with cetology or the science of whales
Many are the men small and great old and new landsmen and seamen who have at large or in little written of the whale
Of the names in this list of whale authors only those following Owen ever saw living whales and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman
On the separate subject of the Greenland or rightwhale he is the best existing authority
But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning
And here be it said that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas
He is not even by any means the largest of the whales
Yet owing to the long priority of his claims and the profound ignorance which till some seventy years back invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown spermwhale and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whaleports this usurpation has been every way complete
Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days will satisfy you that the Greenland whale without one rival was to them the monarch of the seas
This is Charing Cross hear ye good people allthe Greenland whale is deposedthe great sperm whale now reigneth
There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you and at the same time in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt
Those books are Beales and Bennetts both in their time surgeons to English SouthSea whaleships and both exact and reliable men
The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small but so far as it goes it is of excellent quality though mostly confined to scientific description
As yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic lives not complete in any literature
Far above all other hunted whales his is an unwritten life
Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification if only an easy outline one for the present hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers
But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans I have had to do with whales with these visible hands I am in earnest and I will try
First The uncertain unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish
In his System of Nature AD 1776 Linnaeus declares I hereby separate the whales from the fish
The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the waters he states as follows On account of their warm bilocular heart their lungs their movable eyelids their hollow ears penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally ex lege naturae jure meritoque
Be it known that waiving all argument I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish and call upon holy Jonah to back me
This fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish
Next how shall we define the whale by his obvious externals so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come
To be short then a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL
A walrus spouts much like a whale but the walrus is not a fish because he is amphibious
Now then come the grand divisions of the entire whale host I am aware that down to the present time the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs Pigfish and Sowfish of the Coffins of Nantucket are included by many naturalists among the whales
But as these pigfish are a noisy contemptible set mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers and feeding on wet hay and especially as they do not spout I deny their credentials as whales and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology
First According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS subdivisible into CHAPTERS and these shall comprehend them all both small and large
I THE FOLIO WHALE II the OCTAVO WHALE III the DUODECIMO WHALE
As the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE of the OCTAVO the GRAMPUS of the DUODECIMO the PORPOISE
The SPERM WHALE II the RIGHT WHALE III the FINBACK WHALE IV the HUMPBACKED WHALE V the RAZORBACK WHALE VI the SULPHURBOTTOM WHALE
BOOK I FOLIO CHAPTER I SPERM WHALEThis whale among the English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale and the Physeter whale and the Anvil Headed whale is the present Cachalot of the French and the Pottsfich of the Germans and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words
He is without doubt the largest inhabitant of the globe the most formidable of all whales to encounter the most majestic in aspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce he being the only creature from which that valuable substance spermaceti is obtained
Some centuries ago when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish in those days spermaceti it would seem was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale
It was the idea also that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses
And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived
RIGHT WHALEIn one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans being the one first regularly hunted by man
It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen and the oil specially known as whale oil an inferior article in commerce
Among the fishermen he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles The Whale the Greenland Whale the Black Whale the Great Whale the True Whale the Right Whale
What then is the whale which I include in the second species of my Folios
It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes
It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean on the Brazil Banks on the Nor West Coast and various other parts of the world designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds
Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans
The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length with reference to elucidating the sperm whale
FINBACKUnder this head I reckon a monster which by the various names of FinBack TallSpout and LongJohn has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic in the New York packettracks
In the length he attains and in his baleen the Finback resembles the right whale but is of a less portly girth and a lighter colour approaching to olive
He seems a whalehater as some men are manhaters
From having the baleen in his mouth the FinBack is sometimes included with the right whale among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES that is whales with baleen
Of these so called Whalebone whales there would seem to be several varieties most of which however are little known
Broadnosed whales and beaked whales pikeheaded whales bunched whales underjawed whales and rostrated whales are the fishermens names for a few sorts
The baleen hump backfin and teeth these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars
Thus the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale each has a hump but there the similitude ceases
Then this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale each of these has baleen but there again the similitude ceases
In various sorts of whales they form such irregular combinations or in the case of any one of them detached such an irregular isolation as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis
On this rock every one of the whalenaturalists has split
But it may possibly be conceived that in the internal parts of the whale in his anatomythere at least we shall be able to hit the right classification
Nay what thing for example is there in the Greenland whales anatomy more striking than his baleen
Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale
What then remains nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily in their entire liberal volume and boldly sort them that way
HUMPBACKThis whale is often seen on the northern American coast
He has a great pack on him like a peddler or you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale
At any rate the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one
He is the most gamesome and lighthearted of all the whales making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them
BOOK I FOLIO CHAPTER V RAZORBACKOf this whale little is known but his name
OCTAVOESThese embrace the whales of middling magnitude among which present may be numberedI the GRAMPUS II the BLACK FISH III the NARWHALE IV the THRASHER V the KILLER Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain
Because while the whales of this order though smaller than those of the former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure yet the bookbinders Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume but the Octavo volume does
OCTAVO CHAPTER I GRAMPUSThough this fish whose loud sonorous breathing or rather blowing has furnished a proverb to landsmen is so well known a denizen of the deep yet is he not popularly classed among whales
By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale
I do so now touching the Black Fish socalled because blackness is the rule among almost all whales
So call him the Hyena Whale if you please
This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length
When not more profitably employed the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employmentas some frugal housekeepers in the absence of company and quite alone by themselves burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax
Though their blubber is very thin some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil
NARWHALE that is NOSTRIL WHALEAnother instance of a curiously named whale so named I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose
It does not seem to be used like the blade of the swordfish and billfish though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food
Charley Coffin said it was used for an icepiercer for the Narwhale rising to the surface of the Polar Sea and finding it sheeted with ice thrusts his horn up and so breaks through
My own opinion is that however this onesided horn may really be used by the Narwhalehowever that may beit would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets
The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale the Horned whale and the Unicorn whale
The Narwhale has a very picturesque leopardlike look being of a milkwhite ground colour dotted with round and oblong spots of black
KILLEROf this whale little is precisely known to the Nantucketer and nothing at all to the professed naturalist
He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip and hangs there like a leech till the mighty brute is worried to death
Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale on the ground of its indistinctness
He mounts the Folio whales back and as he swims he works his passage by flogging him as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process
DUODECIMOESThese include the smaller whales
To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it may possibly seem strange that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among WHALESa word which in the popular sense always conveys an idea of hugeness
But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales by the terms of my definition of what a whale isie a spouting fish with a horizontal tail
But the next time you have a chance watch him and you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature
The only English name by which he has hitherto been designated is that of the fishersRightWhale Porpoise from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio
Beyond the DUODECIMO this system does not proceed inasmuch as the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales
But there are a rabble of uncertain fugitive halffabulous whales which as an American whaleman I know by reputation but not personally
From Icelandic Dutch and old English authorities there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales blessed with all manner of uncouth names
Concerning the officers of the whalecraft this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on shipboard arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whalefleet
The large importance attached to the harpooneers vocation is evinced by the fact that originally in the old Dutch Fishery two centuries and more ago the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksnyder
In those days the captains authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel while over the whalehunting department and all its concerns the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme
Hence in whaleships and merchantmen alike the mates have their quarters with the captain and so too in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship
But Ahab my Captain still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness and shagginess and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whalehunter like him and therefore all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me
In this one matter Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale captains who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ships cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is at any time permitted there
In most American whalemen the mastheads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessels leaving her port even though she may have fifteen thousand miles and more to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground
And if after a three four or five years voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in hersay an empty vial eventhen her mastheads are kept manned to the last and not till her skysailpoles sail in among the spires of the port does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more
The worthy Obed tells us that in the early times of the whale fishery ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game the people of that island erected lofty spars along the seacoast to which the lookouts ascended by means of nailed cleats something as fowls go upstairs in a henhouse
A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand who upon descrying the game gave notice to the readymanned boats nigh the beach
But this custom has now become obsolete turn we then to the one proper masthead that of a whaleship at sea
In one of those southern whalesmen on a long three or four years voyage as often happens the sum of the various hours you spend at the masthead would amount to several entire months
Your most usual point of perch is the head of the t gallantmast where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks almost peculiar to whalemen called the t gallant crosstrees
Concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mastheads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits called CROWSNESTS in which the lookouts of a Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas
But if we Southern whalefishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were yet that disadvantage is greatly counterbalanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float
With the problem of the universe revolving in me how could Ibeing left completely to myself at such a thoughtengendering altitudehow could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whaleships standing orders Keep your weather eye open and sing out every time
Beware of such an one I say your whales must be seen before they can be killed and this sunkeneyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world and never make you one pint of sperm the richer
For nowadays the whalefishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic melancholy and absentminded young men disgusted with the carking cares of earth and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber
Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the masthead of some luckless disappointed whaleship and in moody phrase ejaculates Roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll
Very often do the captains of such ships take those absentminded young philosophers to task upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient interest in the voyage halfhinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honourable ambition as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise
Why thou monkey said a harpooneer to one of these lads weve been cruising now hard upon three years and thou hast not raised a whale yet
Whales are scarce as hens teeth whenever thou art up here
Vehemently pausing he cried What do ye do when ye see a whale men
A dead whale or a stove boat
But they were all eagerness again as Ahab now halfrevolving in his pivothole with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightly almost convulsively grasping it addressed them thus All ye mastheaders have before now heard me give orders about a white whale
Its a white whale I say resumed Ahab as he threw down the topmaul a white whale
Captain Ahab said Tashtego that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick
Do ye know the white whale then Tash
Aye aye he shouted with a terrific loud animal sob like that of a heartstricken moose Aye aye it was that accursed white whale that razeed me made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day
And this is what ye have shipped for men to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out
Aye aye shouted the harpooneers and seamen running closer to the excited old man A sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance for Moby Dick
But whats this long face about Mr Starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale art not game for Moby Dick
I am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of Death too Captain Ahab if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow but I came here to hunt whales not my commanders vengeance
To me the white whale is that wall shoved near to me
That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate and be the white whale agent or be the white whale principal I will wreak that hate upon him
Are they not one and all with Ahab in this matter of the whale
Drink ye harpooneers drink and swear ye men that man the deathful whaleboats bowDeath to Moby Dick
The long barbed steel goblets were lifted and to cries and maledictions against the white whale the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss
The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in as the small goldfish has its glassy globe
The white whale is their demigorgon
SINGS AND ALL FOLLOW Our captain stood upon the deck A spyglass in his hand A viewing of those gallant whales That blew at every strand
Oh your tubs in your boats my boys And by your braces stand And well have one of those fine whales Hand boys over hand
While the bold harpooner is striking the whale
Spell ohwhew this is worse than pulling after whales in a calmgive us a whiff Tash
We are the lads to hunt him up his whale
White squalls white whale shirr shirr
Here have I heard all their chat just now and the white whaleshirr shirrbut spoken of once and only this eveningit makes me jingle all over like my tambourinethat anaconda of an old man swore em in to hunt him
For some time past though at intervals only the unaccompanied secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen
In that way mostly the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded
And as for those who previously hearing of the White Whale by chance caught sight of him in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them almost as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him as for any other whale of that species
And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there
For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors but of all sailors they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels but hand to jaw give battle to them
Alone in such remotest waters that though you sailed a thousand miles and passed a thousand shores you would not come to any chiseled hearthstone or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun in such latitudes and longitudes pursuing too such a calling as he does the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth
No wonder then that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints and halfformed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears
So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike that few who by those rumors at least had heard of the White Whale few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw
Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body
Nor is the preeminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended than on board of those prows which stem him
And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it we find some book naturalistsOlassen and Povelsondeclaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood
For in his Natural History the Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale all fish sharks included are struck with the most lively terrors and often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death
One of the wild suggestions referred to as at last coming to be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time
It is a thing well known to both American and English whaleships and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas
Hence by inference it has been believed by some whalemen that the Nor West Passage so long a problem to man was never a problem to the whale
For it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales but as was elsewhere thrown outa peculiar snowwhite wrinkled forehead and a high pyramidical white hump
The rest of his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with the same shrouded hue that in the end he had gained his distinctive appellation of the White Whale a name indeed literally justified by his vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea leaving a milkyway wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden gleamings
Nor was it his unwonted magnitude nor his remarkable hue nor yet his deformed lower jaw that so much invested the whale with natural terror as that unexampled intelligent malignity which according to specific accounts he had over and over again evinced in his assaults
But though similar disasters however little bruited ashore were by no means unusual in the fishery yet in most instances such seemed the White Whales infernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death that he caused was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent
Judge then to what pitches of inflamed distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled when amid the chips of chewed boats and the sinking limbs of torn comrades they swam out of the white curds of the whales direful wrath into the serene exasperating sunlight that smiled on as if at a birth or a bridal
His three boats stove around him and oars and men both whirling in the eddies one captain seizing the lineknife from his broken prow had dashed at the whale as an Arkansas duellist at his foe blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathomdeep life of the whale
Small reason was there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal encounter Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him not only all his bodily woes but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations
The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung
That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe onehalf of the worlds which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devilAhab did not fall down and worship it like them but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale he pitted himself all mutilated against it
He piled upon the whales white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down and then as if his chest had been a mortar he burst his hot hearts shell upon it
Nor is it so very unlikely that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage on account of such dark symptoms the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales
But be all this as it may certain it is that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and allengrossing object of hunting the White Whale
For one I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place but while yet all arush to encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill
The Whiteness of The Whale
What the white whale was to Ahab has been hinted what at times he was to me as yet remains unsaid
It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me
And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol
At intervals he would refer to piles of old logbooks beside him wherein were set down the seasons and places in which on various former voyages of various ships sperm whales had been captured or seen
On this hint attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale Since the above was written the statement is happily borne out by an official circular issued by Lieutenant Maury of the National Observatory Washington April 16th 1851
The sum is that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for
In general the same remark only within a less wide limit applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured aged sperm whales
There it was too that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place there the waves were storied with his deeds there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance
But granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it not but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary whale even if encountered should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter even as a whitebearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople
And have I not tallied the whale Ahab would mutter to himself as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveriestallied him and shall he escape
For at such times crazy Ahab the scheming unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this Ahab that had gone to his hammock was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again
I care not to perform this part of my task methodically but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman and from these citations I take itthe conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself
First I have personally known three instances where a whale after receiving a harpoon has effected a complete escape and after an interval in one instance of three years has been again struck by the same hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the same private cypher have been taken from the body
Meanwhile the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa but to no purpose
This man and this whale again came together and the one vanquished the other
I say I myself have known three instances similar to this that is in two of them I saw the whales struck and upon the second attack saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them afterwards taken from the dead fish
In the threeyear instance it so fell out that I was in the boat both times first and last and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whales eye which I had observed there three years previous
Secondly It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery however ignorant the world ashore may be of it that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable
Why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil
But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrityNay you may call it an oceanwide renown not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death but he was admitted into all the rights privileges and distinctions of a name had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar
Was it not so O Don Miguel thou Chilian whale marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back
In plain prose here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar
I do not know where I can find a better place than just here to make mention of one or two other things which to me seem important as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the White Whale more especially the catastrophe
Do you suppose that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps caught by the whaleline off the coast of New Guinea is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathando you suppose that that poor fellows name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read tomorrow at your breakfast
Yet I tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific among many others we spoke thirty different ships every one of which had had a death by a whale some of them more than one and three that had each lost a boats crew
That point is this The Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful knowing and judiciously malicious as with direct aforethought to stave in utterly destroy and sink a large ship and what is more the Sperm Whale HAS done it
One day she saw spouts lowered her boats and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales
Ere long several of the whales were wounded when suddenly a very large whale escaping from the boats issued from the shoal and bore directly down upon the ship
Again At all events the whole circumstances taken together all happening before my own eyes and producing at the time impressions in my mind of decided calculating mischief on the part of the whale many of which impressions I cannot now recall induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion
Secondly The ship Union also of Nantucket was in the year 1807 totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it
Conversation turning upon whales the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present
He peremptorily denied for example that any whale could so smite his stout sloopofwar as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful
But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale that begged a few moments confidential business with him
I am not superstitious but I consider the Commodores interview with that whale as providential
I tell you the sperm whale will stand no nonsense
An uncommon large whale the body of which was larger than the ship itself lay almost at the surface of the water but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship which was in full sail was almost upon him so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him
But I should not much wonder if in the darkness of that early hour of the morning the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath
I might proceed with several more examples one way or another known to me of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale
The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head and as for his strength let me say that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have in a calm been transferred to the ship and secured there the whale towing her great hull through the water as a horse walks off with a cart
But as he destroyed ships as well as for other reasons he must have been a whale and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale
For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it
But further investigations have recently proved to me that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean
I am told on good authority that on the Barbary coast a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale
Now as a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis
In the Propontis as far as I can learn none of that peculiar substance called BRIT is to be found the aliment of the right whale
But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whalesquid or cuttlefishlurks at the bottom of that sea because large creatures but by no means the largest of that sort have been found at its surface
If then you properly put these statements together and reason upon them a bit you will clearly perceive that according to all human reasoning Procopiuss seamonster that for half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor must in all probability have been a sperm whale
It would be refining too much perhaps even considering his monomania to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted
It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen
Granting that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knighterrantism in them still while for the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick they must also have food for their more common daily appetites
To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas from hundreds of whalemens lookouts perched as high in the air but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indians
The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity
And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus
There go flukes was now the cry from Tashtego and the whales disappeared
Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows
But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale
The White Whales at the bottom of it
It aint the White Whale today
Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone like five triphammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer
The whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it
It is used for catching turns with the whale line
At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and crossrunning seas
The whales might have made one of their regular soundings not a temporary dive from mere fright and if that were the case Stubb as his wont in such cases it seems was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe
To a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have been visible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it and suffusingly blowing off to leeward like the confused scud from white rolling billows
Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling and partially beneath a thin layer of water also the whales were swimming
The repeated specific allusions of Flask to that whale as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boats bow with its tailthese allusions of his were at times so vivid and lifelike that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder
Not the raw recruit marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle not the dead mans ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other worldneither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed churned circle of the hunted sperm whale
The jets of vapour no longer blended but tilted everywhere to right and left the whales seemed separating their wakes
The boats were pulled more apart Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward
Squall whale and harpoon had all blended together and the whale merely grazed by the iron escaped
There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod and the great White Whale its object
Mr Stubb said I turning to that worthy who buttoned up in his oiljacket was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain Mr Stubb I think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met our chief mate Mr Starbuck is by far the most careful and prudent
I suppose then that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whalemans discretion
Ive lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape Horn
I should like to see a boats crew backing water up to a whale face foremost
Ha ha the whale would give them squint for squint mind that
Among whalewise people it has often been argued whether considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase
Considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties that every individual moment indeed then comprises a peril under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whaleboat in the hunt
Now with the subordinate phantoms what wonder remained soon waned away for in a whaler wonders soon wane
And yet though herds of whales were seen by night not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them
Southeastward from the Cape off the distant Crozetts a good cruising ground for Right Whalemen a sail loomed ahead the Goney Albatross by name
As she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at the foremasthead I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheriesa whaler at sea and long absent from home
Have ye seen the White Whale
While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whales name to another ship Ahab for a moment paused it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger had not the threatening wind forbade
The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this the wind and sea betokened storms
Though to be sure from the small number of English whalers such meetings do not very often occur and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them for your Englishman is rather reserved and your Yankee he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself
Besides the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American whalers regarding the long lean Nantucketer with his nondescript provincialisms as a sort of seapeasant
But where this superiority in the English whalemen does really consist it would be hard to say seeing that the Yankees in one day collectively kill more whales than all the English collectively in ten years
But this is a harmless little foible in the English whalehunters which the Nantucketer does not take much to heart probably because he knows that he has a few foibles himself
So then we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea the whalers have most reason to be sociableand they are so
And as for Pirates when they chance to cross each others crossbones the first hail isHow many skullsthe same way that whalers hailHow many barrels
But look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociable freeandeasy whaler
What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather
Why it is that all Merchantseamen and also all Pirates and ManofWars men and Slaveship sailors cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whaleships this is a question it would be hard to answer
Hence I conclude that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on
NOUNA SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO OR MORE WHALESHIPS GENERALLY ON A CRUISINGGROUND WHEN AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS THEY EXCHANGE VISITS BY BOATS CREWS THE TWO CAPTAINS REMAINING FOR THE TIME ON BOARD OF ONE SHIP AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE OTHER
All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail so has the whale fishery
But the whaleboat has no seat astern no sofa of that sort whatever and no tiller at all
And as for a tiller the whaleboat never admits of any such effeminacy and therefore as in gamming a complete boats crew must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion and the captain having no place to sit in is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree
It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homewardbound whaleman the TownHo was encountered
To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the TownHos story which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men
Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record The ancient whalecry upon first sighting a whale from the masthead still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin
Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about rehearsing to you gentlemen the TownHo Sperm Whaler of Nantucket was cruising in your Pacific here not very many days sail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn
Any man who has gone sailor in a whaleship will understand this and all this and doubtless much more the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command
Immediately the hammer touched the cheek the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale
We have seen many whaleships in our harbours but never heard of your Canallers
In sum gentlemen what the wildness of this canal life is is emphatically evinced by this that our wild whalefishery contains so many of its most finished graduates and that scarce any race of mankind except Sydney men are so much distrusted by our whaling captains
Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensued while standing out of harms way the valiant captain danced up and down with a whalepike calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke him along to the quarterdeck
But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage they all agreed to another thingnamely not to sing out for whales in case any should be discovered
For spite of her leak and spite of all her other perils the TownHo still maintained her mastheads and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale
Jesu what a whale
Sir sailor but do whales have christenings
And now his bandaged cry was to beach him on the whales topmost back
That instant as he fell on the whales slippery back the boat righted and was dashed aside by the swell while Radney was tossed over into the sea on the other flank of the whale
But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between his jaws and rearing high up with him plunged headlong again and went down
He cut it and the whale was free
All four boats gave chase again but the whale eluded them and finally wholly disappeared
Some ten days after the French ships sailed the whaleboat arrived and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea
Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales
I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whaleship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there
It is time to set the world right in this matter by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong
Now by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whales is to be found in the famous cavernpagoda of Elephanta in India
The Hindoo whale referred to occurs in a separate department of the wall depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedly known as the Matse Avatar
But though this sculpture is half man and half whale so as only to give the tail of the latter yet that small section of him is all wrong
It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda than the broad palms of the true whales majestic flukes
It is Guidos picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the seamonster or whale
Then there are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald and Jonahs whale as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers
As for the bookbinders whale winding like a vinestalk round the stock of a descending anchoras stamped and gilded on the backs and titlepages of many books both old and newthat is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature imitated I take it from the like figures on antique vases
Though universally denominated a dolphin I nevertheless call this bookbinders fish an attempt at a whale because it was so intended when the device was first introduced
In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale where all manner of spouts jets deau hot springs and cold Saratoga and BadenBaden come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain
In the titlepage of the original edition of the Advancement of Learning you will find some curious whales
In old Harriss collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages AD 1671 entitled A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale Peter Peterson of Friesland master
In one of those plates the whales like great rafts of logs are represented lying among iceisles with white bears running over their living backs
In another plate the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes
Then again there is an imposing quarto written by one Captain Colnett a Post Captain in the English navy entitled A Voyage round Cape Horn into the South Seas for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries
In this book is an outline purporting to be a Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mexico August 1793 and hoisted on deck
To mention but one thing about it let me say that it has an eye which applied according to the accompanying scale to a full grown sperm whale would make the eye of that whale a bowwindow some five feet long
In the abridged London edition of 1807 there are plates of an alleged whale and a narwhale
I do not wish to seem inelegant but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow and as for the narwhale one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys
Then again in 1825 Bernard Germain Count de Lacepede a great naturalist published a scientific systemized whale book wherein are several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan
All these are not only incorrect but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale that is to say the Right whale even Scoresby a long experienced man as touching that species declares not to have its counterpart in nature
In 1836 he published a Natural History of Whales in which he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale
In a word Frederick Cuviers Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale but a squash
As for the signpainters whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oildealers what shall be said of them
They are generally Richard III whales with dromedary humps and very savage breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts that is whaleboats full of mariners their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint
But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all
The living whale in his full majesty and significance is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight like a launched lineofbattle ship and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations
And not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a fullgrown Platonian Leviathan yet even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ships deck such is then the outlandish eellike limbered varying shape of him that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch
But it may be fancied that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale accurate hints may be derived touching his true form
In fact as the great Hunter says the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it
However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us said humorous Stubb one day he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens
So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like
Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales and the True Pictures of Whaling Scenes
In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales I am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books both ancient and modern especially in Pliny Purchas Hackluyt Harris Cuvier etc
I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale Colnetts Hugginss Frederick Cuviers and Beales
All Beales drawings of this whale are good excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes capping his second chapter
His frontispiece boats attacking Sperm Whales though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men is admirably correct and lifelike in its general effect
Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour but they are wretchedly engraved
Of the Right Whale the best outline pictures are in Scoresby but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression
He has but one picture of whaling scenes and this is a sad deficiency because it is by such pictures only when at all well done that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters
But taken for all in all by far the finest though in some details not the most correct presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found are two large French engravings well executed and taken from paintings by one Garnery
Respectively they represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale
In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks
The prow of the boat is partially unbroken and is drawn just balancing upon the monsters spine and standing in that prow for that one single incomputable flash of time you behold an oarsman half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale and in the act of leaping as if from a precipice
The halfemptied linetub floats on the whitened sea the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene
Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale but let that pass since for the life of me I could not draw so good a one
In the second engraving the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rockslide from the Patagonian cliffs
Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs shellfish and other sea candies and maccaroni which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back
Thus the foreground is all raging commotion but behind in admirable artistic contrast is the glassy level of a sea becalmed the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship and the inert mass of a dead whale a conquered fortress with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whalepole inserted into his spouthole
But my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman
With not one tenth of Englands experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt
For the most part the English and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things such as the vacant profile of the whale which so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid
It is a quiet noonscene among the isles of the Pacific a French whaler anchored inshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened sails of the ship and the long leaves of the palms in the background both drooping together in the breezeless air
The other engraving is quite a different affair the ship hoveto upon the open sea and in the very heart of the Leviathanic life with a Right Whale alongside the vessel in the act of cuttingin hove over to the monster as if to a quay and a boat hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity is about giving chase to whales in the distance
From the ship the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies and to windward a black cloud rising up with earnest of squalls and rains seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen
Of Whales in Paint in Teeth in Wood in SheetIron in Stone in Mountains in Stars
There are three whales and three boats and one of the boats presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale
His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping at any rate and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings
But though for ever mounted on that stump never a stumpspeech does the poor whaleman make but with downcast eyes stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation
Your true whalehunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois
Wooden whales or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble South Sea warwood are frequently met with in the forecastles of American whalers
At some old gableroofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the roadside door
When the porter is sleepy the anvilheaded whale would be best
But these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays
On the spires of some oldfashioned churches you will see sheetiron whales placed there for weathercocks but they are so elevated and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with HANDS OFF you cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit
Then again in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges
Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens and boats in pursuit of them as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds
With a frigates anchors for my bridlebitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight
Steering northeastward from the Crozetts we fell in with vast meadows of brit the minute yellow substance upon which the Right Whale largely feeds
On the second day numbers of Right Whales were seen who secure from the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit which adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip
Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships
It seemed not a whale and yet is this Moby Dick thought Daggoo
The White Whale the White Whale
The great live squid which they say few whaleships ever beheld and returned to their ports to tell of it
Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object certain it is that a glimpse of it being so very unusual that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness
So rarely is it beheld that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form notwithstanding they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food
For though other species of whales find their food above water and may be seen by man in the act of feeding the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what precisely that food consists
They fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale unlike other species is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it
With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented I have here to speak of the magical sometimes horrible whaleline
Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whalelines for though not so durable as hemp it is stronger and far more soft and elastic and I will add since there is an aesthetics in all things is much more handsome and becoming to the boat than hemp
The whaleline is only twothirds of an inch in thickness
In length the common sperm whaleline measures something over two hundred fathoms
When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the American linetub the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great weddingcake to present to the whales
First In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon
In these instances the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale as it were from the one boat to the other though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort
Thus the whaleline folds the whole boat in its complicated coils twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction
All men live enveloped in whalelines
And if you be a philosopher though seated in the whaleboat you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror than though seated before your evening fire with a poker and not a harpoon by your side
Stubb Kills a Whale
When you see him quid said the savage honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat then you quick see him parm whale
For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground that is it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises dolphins flyingfish and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters than those off the Rio de la Plata or the inshore ground off Peru
And lo close under our lee not forty fathoms off a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate his broad glossy back of an Ethiopian hue glistening in the suns rays like a mirror
But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon
But that pipe poor whale was thy last
The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale and ere the boats were down majestically turning he swam away to the leeward but with such a steady tranquillity and making so few ripples as he swam that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used and no man must speak but in whispers
After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed the whale rose again and being now in advance of the smokers boat and much nearer to it than to any of the others Stubb counted upon the honour of the capture
It was obvious now that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers
All alive to his jeopardy he was going head out that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whales enormous head consists
Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight
Haul inhaul in cried Stubb to the bowsman and facing round towards the whale all hands began pulling the boat up to him while yet the boat was being towed on
Soon ranging up by his flank Stubb firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat darted dart after dart into the flying fish at the word of command the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whales horrible wallow and then ranging up for another fling
And all the while jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman as at every dart hauling in upon his crooked lance by the line attached to it Stubb straightened it again and again by a few rapid blows against the gunwale then again and again sent it into the whale
Pull uppull up he now cried to the bowsman as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath
When reaching far over the bow Stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish and kept it there carefully churning and churning as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out
And now abating in his flurry the whale once more rolled out into view surging from side to side spasmodically dilating and contracting his spouthole with sharp cracking agonized respirations
According to the invariable usage of the fishery the whaleboat pushes off from the ship with the headsman or whalekiller as temporary steersman and the harpooneer or whalefastener pulling the foremost oar the one known as the harpooneeroar
He now has to drop and secure his oar turn round on his centre half way seize his harpoon from the crotch and with what little strength may remain he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale
Again if the dart be successful then at the second critical instant that is when the whale starts to run the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else
I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them
But these two harpoons each by its own cord are both connected with the line the object being this to dart them both if possible one instantly after the other into the same whale so that if in the coming drag one should draw out the other may still retain a hold
But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron it becomes impossible for the harpooneer however lightninglike in his movements to pitch the second iron into him
Furthermore you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard it thenceforth becomes a dangling sharpedged terror skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale entangling the lines or cutting them and making a prodigious sensation in all directions
Nor in general is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse
Consider now how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong active and knowing whale when owing to these qualities in him as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him
Stubbs whale had been killed some distance from the ship
Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night and then handing his lantern to a seaman went his way into the cabin and did not come forward again until morning
Tied by the head to the stern and by the tail to the bows the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessels and seen through the darkness of the night which obscured the spars and rigging aloft the twoship and whale seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks whereof one reclines while the other remains standing A little item may as well be related here
By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass so that now having girdled the whale the chain is readily made to follow suit and being slipped along the body is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes
Stubb was a high liver he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate
Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on whales flesh that night
Peering over the side you could just see them as before you heard them wallowing in the sullen black waters and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head
The mark they thus leave on the whale may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw
Dont I always say that to be good a whalesteak must be tough
Now look here bredren just try wonst to be cibil a helping yourselbs from dat whale

And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years cook and dont know yet how to cook a whalesteak rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question
You must go home and be born over again you dont know how to cook a whalesteak yet
Well then cook you see this whalesteak of yours was so very bad that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible you see that dont you
Well for the future when you cook another whalesteak for my private table here the capstan Ill tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing

The Whale as a Dish
It is upon record that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France and commanded large prices there
Also that in Henry VIIIths time a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises which you remember are a species of whale
The fact is that among his hunters at least the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him but when you come to sit down before a meatpie nearly one hundred feet long it takes away your appetite
Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb nowadays partake of cooked whales but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious
We all know how they live upon whales and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil
And this reminds me that certain Englishmen who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vesselthat these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber
Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called fritters which indeed they greatly resemble being brown and crisp and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives doughnuts or olycooks when fresh
But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish is his exceeding richness
Nevertheless many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance and then partaking of it
In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish
It is not perhaps entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence that appears to result in some way from the consideration before mentioned ie that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea and eat it too by its own light
But Stubb he eats the whale by its own light does he and that is adding insult to injury is it
When in the Southern Fishery a captured Sperm Whale after long and weary toil is brought alongside late at night it is not as a general thing at least customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in
Ex officio professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen
The end of the hawserlike rope winding through these intricacies was then conducted to the windlass and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale to this block the great blubber hook weighing some one hundred pounds was attached
More and more she leans over to the whale while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows till at last a swift startling snap is heard with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber
Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it
The heavers forward now resume their song and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale the other is slowly slackened away and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath into an unfurnished parlor called the blubberroom
And thus the work proceeds the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously both whale and windlass heaving the heavers singing the blubberroom gentlemen coiling the mates scarfing the ship straining and all hands swearing occasionally by way of assuaging the general friction
I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject the skin of the whale
I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat and learned naturalists ashore
The question is what and where is the skin of the whale
True from the unmarred dead body of the whale you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin transparent substance somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin that is previous to being dried when it not only contracts and thickens but becomes rather hard and brittle
I have several such dried bits which I use for marks in my whalebooks
At any rate it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles as you may say
That same infinitely thin isinglass substance which I admit invests the entire body of the whale is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature as the skin of the skin so to speak for it were simply ridiculous to say that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a newborn child
Reckoning ten barrels to the ton you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whales skin
In life the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents
By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular I was much struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi
Like those mystic rocks too the mysticmarked whale remains undecipherable
Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents he not seldom displays the back and more especially his flanks effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance by reason of numerous rude scratches altogether of an irregular random aspect
I should say that those New England rocks on the seacoast which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergsI should say that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular
It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales for I have most remarked them in the large fullgrown bulls of the species
A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale
For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane or still better an Indian poncho slipt over his head and skirting his extremity
It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers in all seas times and tides
What would become of a Greenland whale say in those shuddering icy seas of the North if unsupplied with his cosy surtout
True other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters but these be it observed are your coldblooded lungless fish whose very bellies are refrigerators creatures that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire whereas like man the whale has lungs and warm blood
But more surprising is it to know as has been proved by experiment that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer
Oh man admire and model thyself after the whale
Like the great dome of St Peters and like the great whale retain O man in all seasons a temperature of thine own
Of erections how few are domed like St Peters of creatures how few vast as the whale
The peeled white body of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre though changed in hue it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk
Slowly it floats more and more away the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of screaming fowls whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the whale
In life but few of them would have helped the whale I ween if peradventure he had needed it but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce
Oh horrible vultureism of earth from which not the mightiest whale is free
Espied by some timid manofwar or blundering discoveryvessel from afar when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun and the white spray heaving high against it straightway the whales unharming corpse with trembling fingers is set down in the logSHOALS ROCKS AND BREAKERS HEREABOUTS BEWARE
Thus while in life the great whales body may have been a real terror to his foes in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world
Now the beheading of the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves and not without reason
Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck on the contrary where his head and body seem to join there in that very place is the thickest part of him
Do you not marvel then at Stubbs boast that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale
That done if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of
But with a full grown leviathan this is impossible for the sperm whales head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk and completely to suspend such a burden as that even by the immense tackles of a whaler this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers scales
The Pequods whale being decapitated and the body stripped the head was hoisted against the ships sideabout half way out of the sea so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element
Taking a few turns on the quarterdeck he paused to gaze over the side then slowly getting into the mainchains he took Stubbs long spadestill remaining there after the whales Decapitationand striking it into the lower part of the halfsuspended mass placed its other end crutchwise under one arm and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head
By and by through the glass the strangers boats and manned mastheads proved her a whaleship
Here be it said that like the vessels of military marines the ships of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal all which signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached every captain is provided with it
Thereby the whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean even at considerable distances and with no small facility
Hast thou seen the White Whale demanded Ahab when the boat drifted back
Think think of thy whaleboat stoven and sunk
Meantime the hoisted sperm whales head jogged about very violently and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant
It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home when upon speaking a whaleship her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby Dick and the havoc he had made
Greedily sucking in this intelligence Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale in case the monster should be seen in his gibbering insanity pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated the Shakers receiving the Bible
Now while Macey the mate was standing up in his boats bow and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance lo a broad white shadow rose from the sea by its quick fanning motion temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen
It is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accidents in the SpermWhale Fishery this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any
Gabriel called off the terrorstricken crew from the further hunting of the whale
Mayhew having concluded his narration Ahab put such questions to him that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the White Whale if opportunity should offer
Every whaleship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans
As after this interlude the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair
In the tumultuous business of cuttingin and attending to a whale there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew
It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whales back the blubberhook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates
But in very many cases circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded
The whale be it observed lies almost entirely submerged excepting the immediate parts operated upon
So down there some ten feet below the level of the deck the poor harpooneer flounders about half on the whale and half in the water as the vast mass revolves like a treadmill beneath him
Being the savages bowsman that is the person who pulled the bowoar in his boat the second one from forward it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hardscrabble scramble upon the dead whales back
And yet still further ponderingwhile I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten to jam himstill further pondering I say I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes only in most cases he one way or other has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals
Nor could I possibly forget that do what I would I only had the management of one end of it The monkeyrope is found in all whalers but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together
I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and the shipwhere he would occasionally fall from the incessant rolling and swaying of both
A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man
Suspended over the side in one of the stages Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whalespades wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach
Then watching the mates countenance he added The steward Mr Starbuck had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg there this instant off the whale
It is the captains ordersgrog for the harpooneer on a whale
Enough replied Starbuck only dont hit him again but Oh I never hurt when I hit except when I hit a whale or something of that sort and this fellows a weazel
Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale and Then Have a Talk Over Him
It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whales prodigious head hanging to the Pequods side
Now during the past night and forenoon the Pequod had gradually drifted into a sea which by its occasional patches of yellow brit gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near
An interval passed and the boats were in plain sight in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale
But having plenty of line yet in the tubs and the whale not sounding very rapidly they paid out abundance of rope and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship
But the fagged whale abated his speed and blindly altering his course went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him so that they performed a complete circuit
Wants with it said Flask coiling some spare line in the boats bow did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whales head hoisted on her starboard side and at the same time a Right Whales on the larboard did you never hear Stubb that that ship can never afterwards capsize
Why do ye see the old man is hard bent after that White Whale and the devil there is trying to come round him and get him to swap away his silver watch or his soul or something of that sort and then hell surrender Moby Dick
Take him says the governorand by the Lord Flask if the devil didnt give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with him Ill eat this whale in one mouthful
Well then pull ahead and lets get the whale alongside
Am I the same man that helped kill this whale
The boats were here hailed to tow the whale on the larboard side where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him
Didnt I tell you so said Flask yes youll soon see this right whales head hoisted up opposite that parmacettis
As before the Pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whales head now by the counterpoise of both heads she regained her even keel though sorely strained you may well believe
In disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside the ship the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cut off whole but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crownpiece
The carcases of both whales had dropped astern and the headladen ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers
Meantime Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whales head and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand
The Sperm Whales HeadContrasted View
Here now are two great whales laying their heads together let us join them and lay together our own
Of the grand order of folio leviathans the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale are by far the most noteworthy
They are the only whales regularly hunted by man
To the Nantucketer they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale
Both are massive enough in all conscience but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whales which the Right Whales sadly lacks
There is more character in the Sperm Whales head
In short he is what the fishermen technically call a greyheaded whale
Far back on the side of the head and low down near the angle of either whales jaw if you narrowly search you will at last see a lashless eye which you would fancy to be a young colts eye so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head
Now from this peculiar sideway position of the whales eyes it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead no more than he can one exactly astern
In a word the position of the whales eyes corresponds to that of a mans ears and you may fancy for yourself how it would fare with you did you sideways survey objects through your ears
The whale therefore must see one distinct picture on this side and another distinct picture on that side while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him
But with the whale these two sashes are separately inserted making two distinct windows but sadly impairing the view
This peculiarity of the whales eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes
How is it then with the whale
But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye
With respect to their ears this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right
Is it not curious that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hares
Let us now with whatever levers and steamengines we have at hand cant over the sperm whales head that it may lie bottom up then ascending by a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach
But far more terrible is it to behold when fathoms down in the sea you see some sulky whale floating there suspended with his prodigious jaw some fifteen feet long hanging straight down at rightangles with his body for all the world like a ships jibboom
This whale is not dead he is only dispirited out of sorts perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight a reproach to all his tribe who must no doubt imprecate lockjaws upon him
In most cases this lower jawbeing easily unhinged by a practised artistis disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles including canes umbrellastocks and handles to ridingwhips
There are generally fortytwo teeth in all in old whales much worn down but undecayed nor filled after our artificial fashion
The Right Whales HeadContrasted View
Crossing the deck let us now have a good long look at the Right Whales head
As in general shape the noble Sperm Whales head may be compared to a Roman warchariot especially in front where it is so broadly rounded so at a broad view the Right Whales head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliottoed shoe
Then again if you fix your eye upon this strange crested comblike incrustation on the top of the massthis green barnacled thing which the Greenlanders call the crown and the Southern fishers the bonnet of the Right Whale fixing your eyes solely on this you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak with a birds nest in its crotch
But if this whale be a king he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem
A great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be harelipped
The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres through which the Right Whale strains the water and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time
In the central blinds of bone as they stand in their natural order there are certain curious marks curves hollows and ridges whereby some whalemen calculate the creatures age as the age of an oak by its circular rings
At any rate if we yield to it we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable
And as those ancient dames moved about gaily though in the jaws of the whale as you may say even so in a shower with the like thoughtlessness do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone
But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment and standing in the Right Whales mouth look around you afresh
Ere this you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started withthat the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads
To sum up then in the Right Whales there is no great well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slender mandible of a lower jaw like the Sperm Whales
Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone no huge lower lip and scarcely anything of a tongue
Again the Right Whale has two external spoutholes the Sperm Whale only one
Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whales there
This Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic the Sperm Whale a Platonian who might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years
Ere quitting for the nonce the Sperm Whales head I would have you as a sensible physiologist simplyparticularly remark its front aspect in all its compacted collectedness
Moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose and that what nose he hashis spout holeis on the top of his head you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head nearly one third of his entire length from the front
Wherefore you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whales head is a dead blind wall without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever
In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale as the rind wraps an orange
It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses hoofs
For unless you own the whale you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth
Regarding the Sperm Whales head as a solid oblong you may on an inclined plane sideways divide it into two quoins whereof the lower is the bony structure forming the cranium and jaws and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale
The upper part known as the Case may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
And as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front so the whales vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun
Moreover as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages namely the highlyprized spermaceti in its absolutely pure limpid and odoriferous state
A large whales case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm though from unavoidable circumstances considerable of it is spilled leaks and dribbles away or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can
I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was coated within but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearlcoloured membrane like the lining of a fine pelisse forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whales case
As in decapitating the whale the operators instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine he has therefore to be uncommonly heedful lest a careless untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents
Thus much being said attend now I pray you to that marvellous andin this particular instancealmost fatal operation whereby the Sperm Whales great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped
I know that this queer adventure of the GayHeaders will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some ones falling into a cistern ashore an accident which not seldom happens and with much less reason too than the Indians considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whales well
We thought the tissued infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale was the lightest and most corky part about him and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself
Now had Tashtego perished in that head it had been a very precious perishing smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti coffined hearsed and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale
Therefore though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer in the application of these two semisciences to the whale I will do my endeavor
Physiognomically regarded the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature
And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression hence it would seem that its entire absence as an external appendage must very largely affect the countenance of the whale
A nose to the whale would have been impertinent
In some particulars perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the Sperm Whale is that of the full front of his head
But in the great Sperm Whale this high and mighty godlike dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified that gazing on it in that full front view you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature
Genius in the Sperm Whale
Has the Sperm Whale ever written a book spoken a speech
And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient World he would have been deified by their childmagian thoughts
They deified the crocodile of the Nile because the crocodile is tongueless and the Sperm Whale has no tongue or at least it is so exceedingly small as to be incapable of protrusion
If hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure back to their birthright the merry Mayday gods of old and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted hill then be sure exalted to Joves high seat the great Sperm Whale shall lord it
If then Sir William Jones who read in thirty languages could not read the simplest peasants face in its profounder and more subtle meanings how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whales brow
If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square
So like a choice casket is it secreted in him that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubicyards of his sperm magazine
The whale like all things that are mighty wears a false brow to the common world
But if from the comparative dimensions of the whales proper brain you deem it incapable of being adequately charted then I have another idea for you
Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale
Under all these circumstances would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whales spine phrenologically
But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists I would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference to the Sperm Whales hump
From its relative situation then I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale
However curious it may seem for an oilship to be borrowing oil on the whaleground and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle yet sometimes such a thing really happens and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lampfeeder as Flask did declare
His necessities supplied Derick departed but he had not gained his ships side when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mastheads of both vessels and so eager for the chase was Derick that without pausing to put his oilcan and lampfeeder aboard he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lampfeeders
There were eight whales an average pod
Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance seemed questionable for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social
Its the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern but look did ever whale yaw so before it must be hes lost his tiller
As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses careens buries rolls and wallows on her way so did this old whale heave his aged bulk and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous ribends expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin
Only wait a bit old chap and Ill give ye a sling for that wounded arm cried cruel Flask pointing to the whaleline near him
With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish because not only was he the largest and therefore the most valuable whale but he was nearest to them and the other whales were going with such great velocity moreover as almost to defy pursuit for the time
An instant more and all four boats were diagonically in the whales immediate wake while stretching from them on both sides was the foaming swell that he made
The whale was now going head out and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright
But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke than all three tigersQueequeg Tashtego Daggooinstinctively sprang to their feet and standing in a diagonal row simultaneously pointed their barbs and darted over the head of the German harpooneer their three Nantucket irons entered the whale
The three boats in the first fury of the whales headlong rush bumped the Germans aside with such force that both Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out and sailed over by the three flying keels
Hurrah this whale carries the everlasting mail
And the whale soon ceasing to sound for some time they remained in that attitude fearful of expending more line though the position was a little ticklish
Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best for it is but reasonable to presume that the longer the stricken whale stays under water the more he is exhausted
Because owing to the enormous surface of himin a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feetthe pressure of the water is immense
We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under even here aboveground in the air how vast then the burden of a whale bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean
One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty lineofbattle ships with all their guns and stores and men on board
Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head
Stand by men he stirs cried Starbuck as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water distinctly conducting upwards to them as by magnetic wires the life and death throbs of the whale so that every oarsman felt them in his seat
The lines of which hardly an instant before not one hands breadth could have been gained were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats and soon the whale broke water within two ships lengths of the hunters
Even now when the boats pulled upon this whale and perilously drew over his swaying flukes and the lances were darted into him they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound which kept continually playing while the natural spouthole in his head was only at intervals however rapid sending its affrighted moisture into the air
As strange misgrown masses gather in the knotholes of the noblest oaks when prostrate so from the points which the whales eyes had once occupied now protruded blind bulbs horribly pitiable to see
At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish the whale now spouting thick blood with swift fury blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore capsizing Flasks boat and marring the bows
As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain and with halfstifled melancholy gurglings the spraycolumn lowers and lowers to the groundso the last long dying spout of the whale
Immediately by Starbucks orders lines were secured to it at different points so that ere long every boat was a buoy the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords
By very heedful management when the ship drew nigh the whale was transferred to her side and was strongly secured there by the stiffest flukechains for it was plain that unless artificially upheld the body would at once sink to the bottom
But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales with the flesh perfectly healed around them and no prominence of any kind to denote their place therefore there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to
In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable flukechains to pry them adrift from the timberheads and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on the point of going over
Now this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a very curious thing nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it
Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface
If the only whales that thus sank were old meagre and brokenhearted creatures their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him
For young whales in the highest health and swelling with noble aspirations prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of life with all their panting lard about them even these brawny buoyant heroes do sometimes sink
Be it said however that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species
Where one of that sort go down twenty Right Whales do
This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free
But there are instances where after the lapse of many hours or several days the sunken whale again rises more buoyant than in life
In the Shore Whaling on soundings among the Bays of New Zealand when a Right Whale gives token of sinking they fasten buoys to him with plenty of rope so that when the body has gone down they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again
It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the Pequods mastheads announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering her boats though the only spout in sight was that of a FinBack belonging to the species of uncapturable whales because of its incredible power of swimming
Nevertheless the FinBacks spout is so similar to the Sperm Whales that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it
The gallant Perseus a son of Jupiter was the first whaleman and to the eternal honour of our calling be it said that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent
Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda how the lovely Andromeda the daughter of a king was tied to a rock on the seacoast and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off Perseus the prince of whalemen intrepidly advancing harpooned the monster and delivered and married the maid
And let no man doubt this Arkite story for in the ancient Joppa now Jaffa on the Syrian coast in one of the Pagan temples there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale which the citys legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew
Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromedaindeed by some supposed to be indirectly derived from itis that famous story of St George and the Dragon which dragon I maintain to have been a whale for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together and often stand for each other
Thou art as a lion of the waters and as a dragon of the sea saith Ezekiel hereby plainly meaning a whale in truth some versions of the Bible use that word itself
Any man may kill a snake but only a Perseus a St George a Coffin have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale
Thus then one of our own noble stamp even a whaleman is the tutelary guardian of England and by good rights we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St George
And therefore let not the knights of that honourable company none of whom I venture to say have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St Georges decoration than they
Whether to admit Hercules among us or not concerning this I long remained dubious for though according to the Greek mythologies that antique Crockett and Kit Carsonthat brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale still whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him that might be mooted
Nevertheless he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman at any rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale
But by the best contradictory authorities this Grecian story of Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale and vice versa certainly they are very similar
That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster which gives us the dread Vishnoo one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our LordVishnoo who by the first of his ten earthly incarnations has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale
Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman then even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman
What club but the whalemans can head off like that
Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter
Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale
But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans who standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale and Arion and the dolphin and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts for all that
It is not necessary hints the Bishop that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whales belly but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth
For truly the Right Whales mouth would accommodate a couple of whisttables and comfortably seat all the players
Possibly too Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth but on second thoughts the Right Whale is toothless
Another reason which SagHarbor he went by that name urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whales gastric juices
But this objection likewise falls to the ground because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a DEAD whaleeven as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents and crawled into them
Besides it has been divined by other continental commentators that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by some vessel with a whale for a figurehead and I would add possibly called The Whale as some craft are nowadays christened the Shark the Gull the Eagle
Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a lifepreserveran inflated bag of windwhich the endangered prophet swam to and so was saved from a watery doom
It was this if I remember right Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days journey of Nineveh a city on the Tigris very much more than three days journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast
But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of Nineveh
But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days not to speak of the Tigris waters near the site of Nineveh being too shallow for any whale to swim in
To make them run easily and swiftly the axles of carriages are anointed and for much the same purpose some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat they grease the bottom
Towards noon whales were raised but so soon as the ship sailed down to them they turned and fled with swift precipitancy a disordered flight as of Cleopatras barges from Actium
By great exertion Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron but the stricken whale without at all sounding still continued his horizontal flight with added fleetness
It became imperative to lance the flying whale or be content to lose him
Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities the sleights of hand and countless subtleties to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling
It is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking jerking boat under extreme headway
As a general thing therefore you must first get fast to a whale before any pitchpoling comes into play
Look at him he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat wrapt in fleecy foam the towing whale is forty feet ahead
Then holding the lance full before his waistbands middle he levels it at the whale when covering him with it he steadily depresses the buttend in his hand thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm fifteen feet in the air
Next moment with a rapid nameless impulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance and quivers in the life spot of the whale
The agonized whale goes into his flurry the towline is slackened and the pitchpoler dropping astern folds his hands and mutely watches the monster die
But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs like a human beings the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere
But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth for in his ordinary attitude the Sperm Whales mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface and what is still more his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth
Anomalous as it may seem this is precisely the case with the whale who systematically lives by intervals his full hour and more when at the bottom without drawing a single breath or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air for remember he has no gills
If unmolested upon rising to the surface the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings
Now why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air ere descending for good
How obvious is it too that this necessity for the whales rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase
But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time
Sure it is nevertheless that the Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories
Furthermore as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal and as that long canallike the grand Erie Canalis furnished with a sort of locks that open and shut for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale has no voice unless you insult him by saying that when he so strangely rumbles he talks through his nose
But then again what has the whale to say
Now the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air and for several feet laid along horizontally just beneath the upper surface of his head and a little to one side this curious canal is very much like a gaspipe laid down in a city on one side of a street
But the question returns whether this gaspipe is also a waterpipe in other words whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth and discharged through the spiracle
But the Sperm Whales food is far beneath the surface and there he cannot spout even if he would
And as for this whale spout you might almost stand in it and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely
The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it when always when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout he is in a prodigious commotion the water cascading all around him
And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapour or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spouthole fissure which is countersunk into the summit of the whales head
For even when tranquilly swimming through the midday sea in a calm with his elevated hump sundried as a dromedarys in the desert even then the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain
Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout
Wherefore among whalemen the spout is deemed poisonous they try to evade it
And besides other reasons to this conclusion I am impelled by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale I account him no common shallow being inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings or near shores all other whales sometimes are
Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whales tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man it comprises upon its upper surface alone an area of at least fifty square feet
At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across
To the whale his tail is the sole means of propulsion
Second It is a little significant that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw nevertheless in his conflicts with man he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail
Your only salvation lies in eluding it but if it comes sideways through the opposing water then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale boat and the elasticity of its materials a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two a sort of stitch in the side is generally the most serious result
Third I cannot demonstrate it but it seems to me that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephants trunk
This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea and if he feel but a sailors whisker woe to that sailor whiskers and all
On more accounts than one a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail for I have heard of yet another elephant that when wounded in the fight curved round his trunk and extracted the dart
Fourth Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity and kittenlike he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth
Excepting the sublime BREACHsomewhere else to be describedthis peaking of the whales flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature
Standing at the masthead of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea I once saw a large herd of whales in the east all heading towards the sun and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes
As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant I then testified of the whale pronouncing him the most devout of all beings
The chance comparison in this chapter between the whale and the elephant so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality much less the creatures to which they respectively belong
In an extensive herd so remarkable occasionally are these mystic gestures that I have heard hunters who have declared them akin to FreeMason signs and symbols that the whale indeed by these methods intelligently conversed with the world
Nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body full of strangeness and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant
But if I know not even the tail of this whale how understand his head much more how comprehend his face when face he has none
This rampart is pierced by several sallyports for the convenience of ships and whales conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca
With a fair fresh wind the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea and thence cruising northwards over waters known to be frequented here and there by the Sperm Whale sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands and gain the far coast of Japan in time for the great whaling season there
Mark this too in the whaler
While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff to be transferred to foreign wharves the worldwandering whaleship carries no cargo but herself and crew their weapons and their wants
Hence it is that while other ships may have gone to China from New York and back again touching at a score of ports the whaleship in all that interval may not have sighted one grain of soil her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves
Now as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda indeed as most of the ground roundabout was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising therefore as the Pequod gained more and more upon Java Head the lookouts were repeatedly hailed and admonished to keep wide awake
To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together without being greeted by a single spout and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands
Broad on both bows at the distance of some two or three miles and forming a great semicircle embracing one half of the level horizon a continuous chain of whalejets were upplaying and sparkling in the noonday air
Unlike the straight perpendicular twinjets of the Right Whale which dividing at top fall over in two branches like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow the single forwardslanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist continually rising and falling away to leeward
It seemed formed of detached white vapours rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales only they did not so completely come and go for they constantly hovered without finally disappearing
But still driving on in the wake of the whales at length they seemed abating their speed gradually the ship neared them and the wind now dying away word was passed to spring to the boats
But no sooner did the herd by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale become notified of the three keels that were after themthough as yet a mile in their rearthan they rallied again and forming in close ranks and battalions so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets moved on with redoubled velocity
Best therefore withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men
Though many of the whales as has been said were in violent motion yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated but collectively remained in one place
As is customary in those cases the boats at once separated each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal
Though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances is in no wise unprecedented and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery
But not a bit daunted Queequeg steered us manfully now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance now edging away from that whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead while all the time Starbuck stood up in the bows lance in hand pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts for there was no time to make long ones
All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances originally invented by the Nantucket Indians called druggs
It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used
For then more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time
But sperm whales are not every day encountered while you may then you must kill all you can
The first and second were successfully darted and we saw the whales staggeringly running off fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg
It had been next to impossible to dart these druggedharpoons were it not that as we advanced into the herd our whales way greatly diminished moreover that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion the direful disorders seemed waning
So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out and the towing whale sideways vanished then with the tapering force of his parting momentum we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake
Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales were heard but not felt
In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satinlike surface called a sleek produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods
And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles and saw successive pods of whales eight or ten in each swiftly going round and round like multiplied spans of horses in a ring and so closely shoulder to shoulder that a Titanic circusrider might easily have overarched the middle ones and so have gone round on their backs
Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us
For suspended in those watery vaults floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers
He was a little frisky though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule where tail to head and all ready for the final spring the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartars bow
Who struckTwo whale one big one little
As when the stricken whale that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope as after deep sounding he floats up again and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air so now Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam
When by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunters lance the mothers pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods
When overflowing with mutual esteem the whales salute MORE HOMINUM
Meanwhile as we thus lay entranced the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them
But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles was nothing to what at last met our eyes
It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert to seek to hamstring him as it were by sundering or maiming his gigantic tailtendon
A whale wounded as we afterwards learned in this part but not effectually as it seemed had broken away from the boat carrying along with him half of the harpoon line and in the extraordinary agony of the wound he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold at the battle of Saratoga carrying dismay wherever he went
But agonizing as was the wound of this whale and an appalling spectacle enough any way yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us
First the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little and tumble against each other as if lifted by half spent billows from afar then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell the submarine bridalchambers and nurseries vanished in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters
A low advancing hum was soon heard and then like to the tumultuous masses of blockice when the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain
Shove him off you Queequegthe whale thereprick himhit him
After many similar hairbreadth escapes we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles but now crossed by random whales all violently making for one centre
This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequegs hat who while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales had his hat taken clean from his head by the aireddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by
Further pursuit was useless but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waifed
The waif is a pennoned pole two or three of which are carried by every boat and which when additional game is at hand are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale both to mark its place on the sea and also as token of prior possession should the boats of any other ship draw near
The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the Fisherythe more whales the less fish
Of all the drugged whales only one was captured
The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm Whales and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregations
When serenely advancing on one of these journeys if any strange suspicious sights are seen my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family
As ashore the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers just so with the whales who sometimes come to deadly battle and all for love
Granting other whales to be in sight the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks for these Grand Turks are too lavish of their strength and hence their unctuousness is small
For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery however much for the bower and so being a great traveller he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world every baby an exotic
Now as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school so is the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster
The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing years is true of all aged Sperm Whales
Almost universally a lone whaleas a solitary Leviathan is calledproves an ancient one
For while those female whales are characteristically timid the young males or fortybarrelbulls as they call them are by far the most pugnacious of all Leviathans and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter excepting those wondrous greyheaded grizzled whales sometimes met and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout
The allusion to the waif and waifpoles in the last chapter but one necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge
It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company a whale may be struck by one vessel then escape and be finally killed and captured by another vessel and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies all partaking of this one grand feature
For exampleafter a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm and drifting far away to leeward be retaken by a second whaler who in a calm snugly tows it alongside without risk of life or line
These are scientific commentaries but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocksthe CokeuponLittleton of the fist
True among the more upright and honourable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party
Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whaletrover litigated in England wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas and when indeed they the plaintiffs had succeeded in harpooning the fish they were at last through peril of their lives obliged to forsake not only their lines but their boat itself
Ultimately the defendants the crew of another ship came up with the whale struck killed seized and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs
And when those defendants were remonstrated with their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs teeth and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done he would now retain their line harpoons and boat which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure
Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale line harpoons and boat
Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other
Latin from the books of the Laws of England which taken along with the context means that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land the King as Honourary Grand Harpooneer must have the head and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail
A division which in the whale is much like halving an apple there is no intermediate remainder
It seems that some honest mariners of Dover or Sandwich or some one of the Cinque Ports had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore
Upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternationso truly Englishknowing not what to say fall to vigorously scratching their heads all round meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger
I thought to relieve my old bedridden mother by part of my share of this whale
In a word the whale was seized and sold and his Grace the Duke of Wellington received the money
It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign
Says Plowdon the whale so caught belongs to the King and Queen because of its superior excellence
In his treatise on QueenGold or Queenpinmoney an old Kings Bench author one William Prynne thus discourseth Ye tail is ye Queens that ye Queens wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone
Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies bodices
There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writersthe whale and the sturgeon both royal property under certain limitations and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crowns ordinary revenue
I know not that any other author has hinted of the matter but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish which symbolically regarded may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality
I will bet something now said Stubb that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day
Presently the vapours in advance slid aside and there in the distance lay a ship whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside
As we glided nearer the stranger showed French colours from his peak and by the eddying cloud of vulture seafowl that circled and hovered and swooped around him it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale that is a whale that has died unmolested on the sea and so floated an unappropriated corpse
Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze we saw that the Frenchman had a second whale alongside and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first
In truth it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil
Nevertheless in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this however much he may shun blasted whales in general
The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that Stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spadepole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales
For what oil hell get from that drugged whale there wouldnt be fit to burn in a jail no not in a condemned cell
And as for the other whale why Ill agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours than hell get from that bundle of bones though now that I think of it it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris
Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side and thus come close to the blasted whale and so talk over it
Well then my BoutondeRosebud have you seen the White Whale
WHAT whale
The WHITE Whalea Sperm WhaleMoby Dick have ye seen him
Never heard of such a whale
White Whaleno
Oh keep coolcool yes thats the word why dont you pack those whales in ice while youre working at em
But joking aside though do you know Rosebud that its all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales
The sailors in tasselled caps of red worsted were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales
He says Monsieur said the Guernseyman in French turning to his captain that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel whose captain and chiefmate with six sailors had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside
Why since he takes it so easy tell him that now I have eyed him carefully Im quite certain that hes no more fit to command a whaleship than a St Jago monkey
He vows and declares Monsieur that the other whale the dried one is far more deadly than the blasted one in fine Monsieur he conjures us as we value our lives to cut loose from these fish
Instantly the captain ran forward and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cuttingtackles and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship
He says Monsieur that his principles wont admit of his drinking but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink then Monsieur had best drop all four boats and pull the ship away from these whales for its so calm they wont drift
By this time Stubb was over the side and getting into his boat hailed the Guernseyman to this effectthat having a long towline in his boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ships side
While the Frenchmans boats then were engaged in towing the ship one way Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long towline
Presently a breeze sprang up Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale hoisting his boats the Frenchman soon increased his distance while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubbs whale
Who would think then that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale
By some ambergris is supposed to be the cause and by others the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale
I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal but cannot owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen and which in the estimation of some already biased minds might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the Frenchmans two whales
They hint that all whales always smell bad
The consequence is that upon breaking into the hold and unloading one of these whale cemeteries in the Greenland dock a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city graveyard for the foundations of a LyinginHospital
I partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland in former times of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack in his great work on Smells a textbook on that subject
As its name imports smeer fat berg to put up this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out without being taken home to Holland for that purpose
But all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler which in a voyage of four years perhaps after completely filling her hold with oil does not perhaps consume fifty days in the business of boiling out and in the state that it is casked the oil is nearly scentless
The truth is that living or dead if but decently treated whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor nor can whalemen be recognised as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company by the nose
Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant when as a general thing he enjoys such high health taking abundance of exercise always out of doors though it is true seldom in the open air
I say that the motion of a Sperm Whales flukes above water dispenses a perfume as when a muskscented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor
What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance considering his magnitude
Now in the whale ship it is not every one that goes in the boats
Some few hands are reserved called shipkeepers whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale
The first time Stubb lowered with him Pip evinced much nervousness but happily for that time escaped close contact with the whale and therefore came off not altogether discreditably though Stubb observing him took care afterwards to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost for he might often find it needful
Now upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the whale and as the fish received the darted iron it gave its customary rap which happened in this instance to be right under poor Pips seat
The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap paddle in hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest he breasted it overboard with him so as to become entangled in it when at last plumping into the water
That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run the line swiftly straightened and presto poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat remorselessly dragged there by the line which had taken several turns around his chest and neck
Damn him cut roared Stubb and so the whale was lost and Pip was saved
We cant afford to lose whales by the likes of you a whale would sell for thirty times what you would Pip in Alabama
It was under very similar circumstances to the first performance but this time he did not breast out the line and hence when the whale started to run Pip was left behind on the sea like a hurried travellers trunk
Stubbs inexorable back was turned upon him and the whale was winged
But it so happened that those boats without seeing Pip suddenly spying whales close to them on one side turned and gave chase and Stubbs boat was now so far away and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish that Pips ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably
That whale of Stubbs so dearly purchased was duly brought to the Pequods side where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed were regularly gone through even to the baling of the Heidelburgh Tun or Case
Now while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other things akin to it in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the tryworks
After being severed from the whale the whitehorse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer
Plumpudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whales flesh here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness
It is called slobgollion an appellation original with the whalemen and even so is the nature of the substance
Gurry so called is a term properly belonging to right whalemen but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen
It designates the dark glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland or right whale and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan
Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whales vocabulary
But as applied by whalemen it becomes so
A whalemans nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathans tail it averages an inch in thickness and for the rest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe
This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanketpieces when stript and hoisted from the whale
Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this postmortemizing of the whale and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange enigmatical object which you would have seen there lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers
Not the wondrous cistern in the whales huge head not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail none of these would so surprise you as half a glimpse of that unaccountable conelonger than a Kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and jetblack as Yojo the ebony idol of Queequeg
Besides her hoisted boats an American whaler is outwardly distinguished by her tryworks
Like a plethoric burning martyr or a selfconsuming misanthrope once ignited the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body
Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers always the whaleships stokers
But the whaleman as he seeks the food of light so he lives in light
See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lampsoften but old bottles and vials thoughto the copper cooler at the tryworks and replenishes them there as mugs of ale at a vat
Besides from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale a potent lye is readily made and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side that lye quickly exterminates it
But mark aloft there at the three mast heads stand three men intent on spying out more whales which if caught infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture and drop at least one small greasespot somewhere
For it was set apart and sanctified to one awestriking end and however wanton in their sailor ways one and all the mariners revered it as the white whales talisman
I see nothing here but a round thing made of gold and whoever raises a certain whale this round thing belongs to him
If the White Whale be raised it must be in a month and a day when the sun stands in some one of these signs
Ha ha old Ahab the White Whale hell nail ye
Hast seen the White Whale
Hast seen the White Whale
See you this and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone terminating in a wooden head like a mallet
Now it is no very easy matter for anybodyexcept those who are almost hourly used to it like whalemento clamber up a ships side from a boat on the open sea for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson
As good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous and the great tackles were still aloft and the massive curved blubberhook now clean and dry was still attached to the end
Where didst thou see the White Whalehow long ago
The White Whale said the Englishman pointing his ivory arm towards the East and taking a rueful sight along it as if it had been a telescope there I saw him on the Line last season
I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time
Well one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales and my boat fastened to one of them a regular circus horse he was too that went milling and milling round so that my boats crew could only trim dish by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale
Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale with a milkywhite head and hump all crows feet and wrinkles
How it was exactly continued the onearmed commander I do not know but in biting the line it got foul of his teeth caught there somehow but we didnt know it then so that when we afterwards pulled on the line bounce we came plump on to his hump instead of the other whales that went off to windward all fluking
Seeing how matters stood and what a noble great whale it wasthe noblest and biggest I ever saw sir in my lifeI resolved to capture him spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in
And thinking the haphazard line would get loose or the tooth it was tangled to might draw for I have a devil of a boats crew for a pull on a whaleline seeing all this I say I jumped into my first mates boatMr
But Lord look you sirhearts and souls alive manthe next instant in a jiff I was blind as a batboth eyes outall befogged and bedeadened with black foamthe whales tail looming straight up out of it perpendicular in the air like a marble steeple
It was a shocking bad wound began the whalesurgeon and taking my advice Captain Boomer here stood our old Sammy Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship interrupted the onearmed captain addressing Ahab go on boy
What became of the White Whale now cried Ahab who thus far had been impatiently listening to this byplay between the two Englishmen
Well after he sounded we didnt see him again for some time in fact as I before hinted I didnt then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick till some time afterwards when coming back to the Line we heard about Moby Dickas some call himand then I knew it was he
Do you know gentlemenvery gravely and mathematically bowing to each Captain in successionDo you know gentlemen that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine Providence that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a mans arm
So that what you take for the White Whales malice is only his awkwardness
Yes Captain Boomer if you are quick enough about it and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other why in that case the arm is yours only let the whale have another chance at you shortly thats all
No more White Whales for me Ive lowered for him once and that has satisfied me
Ere the English ship fades from sight be it set down here that she hailed from London and was named after the late Samuel Enderby merchant of that city the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby  Sons a house which in my poor whalemans opinion comes not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons in point of real historical interest
Be it distinctly recorded here that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him
In 1778 a fine ship the Amelia fitted out for the express purpose and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys boldly rounded Cape Horn and was the first among the nations to lower a whaleboat of any sort in the great South Sea
The voyage was a skilful and lucky one and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm the Amelias example was soon followed by other ships English and American and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open
In 1819 the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan
But why was it think ye that the Samuel Enderby and some other English whalers I know ofnot all thoughwere such famous hospitable ships that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and the joke and were not soon weary of eating and drinking and laughing
The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter for historical research
Nor have I been at all sparing of historical whale research when it has seemed needed
The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders Zealanders and Danes from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery and what is yet more their fat old fashions touching plenty to eat and drink
For as a general thing the English merchantship scrimps her crew but not so the English whaler
During my researches in the Leviathanic histories I stumbled upon an ancient Dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of it I knew must be about whalers
The title was Dan Coopman wherefore I concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery as every whale ship must carry its cooper
In short this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland and among other subjects contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery
And in this chapter it was headed Smeer or Fat that I found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen from which list as translated by Dr Snodhead I transcribe the following 400000 lbs of beef 60000 lbs
Now whether these gin and beer harpooneers so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in a boats head and take good aim at flying whales this would seem somewhat improbable
But no more enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers and that the English whalers have not neglected so excellent an example
Hitherto in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale I have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features
How is it that you a mere oarsman in the fishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale
Can you land a fullgrown whale on your deck for examination as a cook dishes a roastpig
I confess that since Jonah few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless I have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature
In a ship I belonged to a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons and for the heads of the lances
Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale which after an unusually long raging gale had been found dead and stranded with his head against a cocoanut tree whose plumagelike tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet
Now when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale and saw the skull an altar and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu
There is a Leviathanic Museum they tell me in Hull England one of the whaling ports of that country where they have some fine specimens of finbacks and other whales
Likewise I have heard that in the museum of Manchester in New Hampshire they have what the proprietors call the only perfect specimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United States
Moreover at a place in Yorkshire England Burton Constable by name a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale but of moderate size by no means of the fullgrown magnitude of my friend King Tranquos
In both cases the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds
Sir Cliffords whale has been articulated throughout so that like a great chest of drawers you can open and shut him in all his bony cavitiesspread out his ribs like a gigantic fanand swing all day upon his lower jaw
But as I was crowded for space and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then composingat least what untattooed parts might remainI did not trouble myself with the odd inches nor indeed should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale
Measurement of The Whales Skeleton
In length the Sperm Whales skeleton at Tranque measured seventytwo Feet so that when fully invested and extended in life he must have been ninety feet long for in the whale the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body
In considering these ribs I could not but be struck anew with the circumstance so variously repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form
Now the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet whereas the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet
How vain and foolish then thought I for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton stretched in this peaceful wood
Only in the heart of quickest perils only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes only on the profound unbounded sea can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out
The Fossil Whale
From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge amplify and generally expatiate
And here be it said that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson expressly purchased for that purpose because that famous lexicographers uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me
Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales I present my credentials as a geologist by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a stonemason and also a great digger of ditches canals and wells winevaults cellars and cisterns of all sorts
Detached broken fossils of preadamite whales fragments of their bones and skeletons have within thirty years past at various intervals been found at the base of the Alps in Lombardy in France in England in Scotland and in the States of Louisiana Mississippi and Alabama
But some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to Owen the English Anatomist it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale though of a departed species
A significant illustration of the fact again and again repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body
Then the whole world was the whales and king of creation he left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs
I am horrorstruck at this antemosaic unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale which having been before all time must needs exist after all humane ages are over
Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale in his own osseous postdiluvian reality as set down by the venerable John Leo the old Barbary traveller
Not far from the Seaside they have a Temple the Rafters and Beams of which are made of WhaleBones for Whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore
The Common People imagine that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the temple no Whale can pass it without immediate death
But the truth of the Matter is that on either side of the Temple there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea and wound the Whales when they light upon em
They keep a Whales Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle which lying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost makes an Arch the Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camels Back
Their Historians affirm that a Prophet who prophesyd of Mahomet came from this Temple and some do not stand to assert that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the Base of the Temple
In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you reader and if you be a Nantucketer and a whaleman you will silently worship there
Does the Whales Magnitude DiminishWill He Perish
But upon investigation we find that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary system embracing a distinct geological period prior to man but of the whales found in that Tertiary system those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones
Of all the preadamite whales yet exhumed by far the largest is the Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton
Whereas we have already seen that the tapemeasure gives seventytwo feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale
And I have heard on whalemens authority that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture
But may it not be that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods may it not be that since Adams time they have degenerated
For Pliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk and Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in lengthRope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales
And even in the days of Banks and Solander Cookes naturalists we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales reydansiskur or Wrinkled Bellies at one hundred and twenty yards that is three hundred and sixty feet
And Lacepede the French naturalist in his elaborate history of whales in the very beginning of his work page 3 sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres three hundred and twentyeight feet
But will any whaleman believe these stories
The whale of today is as big as his ancestors in Plinys time
And if ever I go where Pliny is I a whaleman more than he was will make bold to tell him so
Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for fortyeight months think they have done extremely well and thank God if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish
Nor considered aright does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale for example that in former years the latter part of the last century say these Leviathans in small pods were encountered much oftener than at present and in consequence the voyages were not so prolonged and were also much more remunerative
Because as has been elsewhere noticed those whales influenced by some views to safety now swim the seas in immense caravans so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries yokes and pods and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated unfrequent armies
And equally fallacious seems the conceit that because the socalled whalebone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them hence that species also is declining
But as perhaps fifty of these whalebone whales are harpooned for one cachalot some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions
But though for some time past a number of these whales not less than 13000 have been annually slain on the norwest coast by the Americans alone yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter
Moreover we are to consider that from the presumed great longevity of whales their probably attaining the age of a century and more therefore at any one period of time several distinct adult generations must be contemporary
Wherefore for all these things we account the whale immortal in his species however perishable in his individuality
In Noahs flood he despised Noahs Ark and if ever the world is to be again flooded like the Netherlands to kill off its rats then the eternal whale will still survive and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood spout his frothed defiance to the skies
And when that functionary appeared before him he bade him without delay set about making a new leg and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jawivory Sperm Whale which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage in order that a careful selection of the stoutest clearestgrained stuff might be secured
At all times except when whales were alongside this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the Tryworks
A lost landbird of strange plumage strays on board and is made a captive out of clean shaved rods of rightwhale bone and crossbeams of sperm whale ivory the carpenter makes a pagodalooking cage for it
Yes now that I think of it heres his bedfellow has a stick of whales jawbone for a wife
Much concern was shown and Starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair In Spermwhalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board it is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold and drench the casks with seawater which afterwards at varying intervals is removed by the ships pumps
So with poor Queequeg who as harpooneer must not only face all the rage of the living whale butas we have elsewhere seenmount his dead back in a rolling sea and finally descend into the gloom of the hold and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage
To be short among whalemen the harpooneers are the holders so called
No he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket all the more congenial to him being a whaleman that like a whaleboat these coffincanoes were without a keel though that involved but uncertain steering and much leeway adown the dim ages
Tell them he jumped from a whaleboat
Let em go drown like Pip that jumped from a whaleboat
In a word it was Queequegs conceit that if a man made up his mind to live mere sickness could not kill him nothing but a whale or a gale or some violent ungovernable unintelligent destroyer of that sort
His firm lips met like the lips of a vice the Delta of his foreheads veins swelled like overladen brooks in his very sleep his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull Stern all the White Whale spouts thick blood
I too want a harpoon made one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part Perth something that will stick in a whale like his own finbone
Is not this harpoon for the White Whale
Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh and the White Whales barbs were then tempered
Often in mild pleasant weather for twelve fifteen eighteen and twenty hours on the stretch they were engaged in the boats steadily pulling or sailing or paddling after the whales or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising though with but small success for their pains
The three men at her masthead wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats from the stern a whaleboat was suspended bottom down and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain
On the quarterdeck the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olivehued girls who had eloped with them from the Polynesian Isles while suspended in an ornamented boat firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast three Long Island negroes with glittering fiddlebows of whale ivory were presiding over the hilarious jig
Hast seen the White Whale gritted Ahab in reply
The Dying Whale
For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor whales were seen and four were slain and one of them by Ahab
Soothed again but only soothed to deeper gloom Ahab who had sterned off from the whale sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat
For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dyingthe turning sunwards of the head and so expiringthat strange spectacle beheld of such a placid evening somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before
Nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head and then gone round again without a lesson to me
In vain oh whale dost thou seek intercedings with yon allquickening sun that only calls forth life but gives it not again
The Whale Watch
The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart one far to windward one less distant to leeward one ahead one astern
The waifpole was thrust upright into the dead whales spouthole and the lantern hanging from its top cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black glossy back and far out upon the midnight waves which gently chafed the whales broad flank like soft surf upon a beach
Ahab and all his boats crew seemed asleep but the Parsee who crouching in the bow sat watching the sharks that spectrally played round the whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails
The grey dawn came on and the slumbering crew arose from the boats bottom and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship
Oh jolly is the gale And a joker is the whale A flourishin his tail Such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hokypoky lad is the Ocean oh
Look up at it mark it well the white flame but lights the way to the White Whale
Ahabs harpoon the one forged at Perths fire remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch so that it projected beyond his whaleboats bow but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale forked fire
Petrified by his aspect and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held the men fell back in dismay and Ahab again spoke All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine and heart soul and body lungs and life old Ahab is bound
Pip jumped from the whaleboat
And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the White Whale on the White Whales own peculiar ground that man was swallowed up in the deep
Hast seen the White Whale
Have ye seen a whaleboat adrift
In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water and after that nothing more whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers as often happens
Who ever heard of two pious whaleships cruising after one missing whaleboat in the height of the whaling season
Nor does it unfrequently occur that Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them for a protracted three or four years voyage in some other ship than their own so that their first knowledge of a whalemans career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a fathers natural but untimely partiality or undue apprehensiveness and concern
Jumped from a whaleboat onceseen him
I will have the first sight of the whale myselfhe said
Now the first time Ahab was perched aloft ere he had been there ten minutes one of those redbilled savage seahawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mastheads of whalemen in these latitudes one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings
Upon the strangers shears were beheld the shattered white ribs and some few splintered planks of what had once been a whaleboat but you now saw through this wreck as plainly as you see through the peeled halfunhinged and bleaching skeleton of a horse
Hast seen the White Whale
Tempered in blood and tempered by lightning are these barbs and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin where the White Whale most feels his accursed life
On such a dayvery much such a sweetness as thisI struck my first whalea boyharpooneer of eighteen
He declared that a whale must be near
Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three lookouts the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing
From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air
I only none of ye could have raised the White Whale first
There againthere again he cried in longdrawn lingering methodic tones attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whales visible jets
A gentle joyousnessa mighty mildness of repose in swiftness invested the gliding whale
Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns his lovely leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid with smooth bewitching fleetness rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete not Jove not that great majesty Supreme did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam
On each soft sidecoincident with the parted swell that but once leaving him then flowed so wide awayon each bright side the whale shed off enticings
Yet calm enticing calm oh whale thou glidest on to all who for the first time eye thee no matter how many in that same way thou mayst have bejuggled and destroyed before
An hour said Ahab standing rooted in his boats stern and he gazed beyond the whales place towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward
Now by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis its bow by anticipation was made to face the whales head while yet under water
Through and through through every plank and each rib it thrilled for an instant the whale obliquely lying on his back in the manner of a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth so that the long narrow scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air and one of the teeth caught in a rowlock
In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse
At that preluding moment ere the boat was yet snapped Ahab the first to perceive the whales intent by the crafty upraising of his head a movement that loosed his hold for the time at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite
But only slipping further into the whales mouth and tilting over sideways as it slipped the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw spilled him out of it as he leaned to the push and so he fell flatfaced upon the sea
It receives its designation pitchpoling from its being likened to that preliminary upanddown poise of the whalelance in the exercise called pitchpoling previously described
By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him
Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whales insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swimthough he could still keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that helpless Ahabs head was seen like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst
For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whales aspect and so planetarily swift the evercontracting circles he made that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them
But struggling out of it again and chancing to rise on a towering crest he shoutedSail on the whaleDrive him off
The Pequods prows were pointed and breaking up the charmed circle she effectually parted the white whale from his victim
At the well known methodic intervals the whales glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mastheads and when he would be reported as just gone down Ahab would take the time and then pacing the deck binnaclewatch in hand so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired his voice was heardWhose is the doubloon now
Here be it said that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale continued through day into night and through night into day is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery
But to render this acuteness at all successful in the end the wind and the sea must be the whalemans allies for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninetythree leagues and a quarter from his port
Inferable from these statements are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales
Aye aye cried Stubb I knew itye cant escapeblow on and split your spout O whale the mad fiend himself is after ye blow your trumpblister your lungsAhab will dam off your blood as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream
It was even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistaken some other thing for the whalespout as the event itself soon proved for hardly had Ahab reached his perch hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck when he struck the keynote to an orchestra that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles
For not by any calm and indolent spoutings not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching
Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more
There she breaches there she breaches was the cry as in his immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmonlike to Heaven
Ahabs boat was central and cheering his men he told them he would take the whale headandheadthat is pull straight up to his foreheada not uncommon thing for when within a certain limit such a course excludes the coming onset from the whales sidelong vision
But at last in his untraceable evolutions the White Whale so crossed and recrossed and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him that they foreshortened and of themselves warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little as if to rally for a more tremendous charge
Nor white whale nor man nor fiend can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being
The harpoon tootoss over the litter theredye see itthe forged iron men the white whalesno no noblistered fool this hand did dart ittis in the fishAloft there
But in this matter of the whale be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this handa lipless unfeatured blank
When dusk descended the whale was still in sight to leeward
Dye see him cried Ahab but the whale was not yet in sight
Leeward the white whale goes that way look to windward then the better if the bitterer quarter
Goodbye mastheadkeep a good eye upon the whale the while Im gone
Well talk tomorrow nay tonight when the white whale lies down there tied by head and tail
It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whaleboats in those swarming seas the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east
See ye my boys hand on the hillCrazedaloft therekeep thy keenest eye upon the boats Mark well the whaleHo againdrive off that hawk see he peckshe tears the vanepointing to the red flag flying at the maintruckHa he soars away with itWheres the old man now seest thou that sight oh Ahabshudder shudder
The boats had not gone very far when by a signal from the mastheadsa downward pointed arm Ahab knew that the whale had sounded but intending to be near him at the next rising he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence as the headbeat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow
Crushed thirty feet upwards the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale
While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks and as the whale swimming out from them turned and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again at that moment a quick cry went up
Lashed round and round to the fishs back pinioned in the turns upon turns in which during the past night the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him the half torn body of the Parsee was seen his sable raiment frayed to shreds his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab
Ye are not other men but my arms and my legs and so obey meWheres the whale gone down again
Whether fagged by the three days running chase and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him whichever was true the White Whales way now began to abate as it seemed from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more though indeed the whales last start had not been so long a one as before
They will last long enough pull onBut who can tellhe mutteredwhether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on AhabBut pull on
Almost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduated instantaneous swiftness the White Whale darted through the weltering sea
The whale
But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledgehammering seas the before whalesmitten bowends of two planks burst through and in an instant almost the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves its halfwading splashing crew trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water
The whale the whale
I grin at thee thou grinning whale
I grin at thee thou grinning whale
Oh oh oh oh thou grinning whale but therell be plenty of gulping soon
Diving beneath the settling ship the whale ran quivering along its keel but turning under water swiftly shot to the surface again far off the other bow but within a few yards of Ahabs boat where for a time he lay quiescent
Towards thee I roll thou alldestroying but unconquering whale to the last I grapple with thee from hells heart I stab at thee for hates sake I spit my last breath at thee
Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool and since neither can be mine let me then tow to pieces while still chasing thee though tied to thee thou damned whale
The harpoon was darted the stricken whale flew forward with igniting velocity the line ran through the groovesran foul
